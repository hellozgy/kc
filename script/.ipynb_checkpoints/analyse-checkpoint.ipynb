      "answer to m tze well , i am surprised to see that i am unblocked ! at least , you still have seen that you targeted the wrong person for the wrong reasons ! m tze , i have used this wikipedia for only a few days but i am still not an idiot . of course , what i say further below on what i think you did is an assumption but i believe a very good one ! here is what you did . you saw the following i posted on the bosendorfer discussion page : \" very soon , this article will be published and you will have to leave it this way ; otherwise , the censors at wikipedia will be forced to side with me ( ! ) considering the fact that i gave you the opportunity to challenge what i wrote in my article . \" . as you clearly told me yourself , you did not want my article to be published . this quote clearly threatened you because i told taht i will soon publish my article and it will be with the full support of everybody because i used the discussion page of bosendorfer . you then contacted andrew norman to block me to prevent me from editing the bosendorfer discussion page and then you thought you could keep me away on my own user page with the intention of blocking me in definitively . when you blocked me in definitively through ro ber tg , you knew too well that no one could read my user page afterward ! that is what i believe you did ! and it is probably easily verifiable by people at wikipedia . now , what is your role at wikipedia ? you are not an administrator ; otherwise you would have blocked me yourself directly ! anyway , i propose to carry on the discussion on the bosendorfer discussion page concerning my article . i am ready to change sentences that cause problems . it is just up to you to mention these problematic sentences on this bosendorfer discussion page and if you have a valid reason to have this sentence changed , it will be changed . i am not a fanatic and i am ready to please people . i will use logic and reason to assess a request to change sentences , not emotions . if i do not want to change a sentence , i will say clearly why and we could discuss further on this refusal to accept a change if it happens . and i will answer the points you raised in your previous postings , m tze . so , i hope you will behave a little bit more relaxed about what i intend to do . the goal : publish a good article on a good product that inform people who read it . apparently , for the time being , mostly the group of administrators and their friends ( ! ) who are the only ones who complained about my article so far . but to have had to go through such a nightmare just to want to publish a good article on wikipedia is surely not the right way to do at wikipedia with people who are ready to contribute positively ! you are really going to put people off wanting to write on wikipedia ! and i especially target the administrators who have been in contact with me in a very aggressive way . just a few days ago , i did not even know that what an administrator was at wikipedia ! here is what jimbo wales says on his user page : \" newcomers are always to be welcomed . there must be no cabal , there must be no elites , there must be no hierarchy or structure which gets in the way of this openness to newcomers . \" . if he k news what i had to go through and the very aggressive behaviour i experienced from administrators at wikipedia , he would not be very pleased . what i say above , he call it one of his main principles ! so , administrators , when you contact people , make sure you remember this very core principle of one of the founders of wikipedia and target the true vandals instead of people like me who are willing to add a good article to wikipedia ! jimbo wales wants people to write as many articles as possible on wikipedia . your role as administrators is to help and encourage them to do so instead of trying to block them in definitively ! so , i hope you can now all relax and not get emotional or upset on this coming article . i follow the process used by wikipedia to deal with an article that causes opposition . see the new comments now on the bosendorfer discussion page and state the sentences that cause you problems and especially why these sentences are problematic . then , i will do my best to change them to please everybody . mic ha eli s great\n",

      "newly discovered documentary evidence that affects this article 's acc ur ac yi have recently found a booklet of questions and answers with rawat printed and distributed by divine light mission , inc . which bears heavily on some of the issues central to this article . this document was published at least five years after the family split , seven or eight years after rawat came to the west and when he was either or years old . in other words , at the time he uttered these statements , he was an adult who was long familiar with western culture , spoke good english and was very much his own man . here a few of the questions and answers : some people say you are a divine incarnation , and some people say other things about you . what 's the truth ? you yourself must realize what is the truth . so god can not teach anything , except through a master ? what is god ? you do n't know what god is . god can not be a human being . god is light . god is power . god can not talk . electricity can not give light , only the bulb gives light , but electricity has to be put through the wire for the bulb to give light . it 's power . power can n to do anything . it has to be put through a medium . why does a perfect master have to have a living body to give knowledge ? why is he ne cess sary ? are you feeling th ir sty ? can you see that photo of lord shiva ? you see the water coming out from the top of his head ? drink that water . drink , drink . can you ? you ca n't drink that water . it is a picture . you need everything living . if you have doubts , you can not ask lord krishna questions . what 's why you need a living master for the circumstances of this world today . when jesus was here there were no nuclear bombs . but now there are nuclear bombs , and the perfect master , the perfect savior [ sic ] , has come to save you from nuclear bombs . is the living master able to reveal knowledge ? yes , that 's why you call him a living master . guru maharaj ji , jesus christ performed many cures . can you do the same ? at his time there were not so many doctors , that 's why he did that . but i am curing mental sickness . if you have got mental sickness , come to me . and when you do meditation , you become so natural that any other diseases you have are automatically cured . that 's why i tell you this knowledge is very practical . it makes people natural . they stop being plastic . they become natural and the best way of ending disease is by nature . what happens to a person 's karma when they receive knowledge ? it starts choking up . it starts finishing up , because when you realize knowledge , you 've got to go and be one with god . will this knowledge save us from rebirth ? yes . once we have this knowledge we reach the heaven from where we can not return . guru maharaj ji , are you permanently in god consciousness ? . [ torn page ] . permanently in god consciousness . the lower part of the last page in the book is intact and it 's a quote that reads : \" i have found that missing link . as soon as i found that missing link , i became one with everything . and therefore i became everything . not as an individual but by merging into that infinite thing which has no beginning , which has no end , which can not be destroyed . and i have that for you to experience . \" he signs this last quote : \" guru maharaj ji \" i maintain that there are several aspects of the article that need to be corrected or , at minimum , balanced by this evidence . for instance , it flies in the face of the quotation from rawat 's then - website wherein he said : people through the years have tried to place me in a mold , and from the very early years i have not been able to oblige them . when i was very young , people were looking for the \" old silver - haired guru with flowing white ro bes . \" i was only eight . when people were f locking to india for their search , i was in the west . when people were looking for sophisticated discourses , i spoke of simple things . when people wanted nirvana , i said , \" you need peace . \" when people said , \" tell us of the scriptures , \" i said , \" look within you . \" when people asked , \" what is your qualification ? \" i said , \" judge me by what i offer . \" to this day , some people see me the way they want to . after all , i guess it is rather inconvenient to see things as they really are . i have evolved , but my message stays the same . externally , i have changed but within me , something stays the same . long after rawat was \" only eight \" he was playing games about whether or not he was god , he was saying that the reason he does n't cure people like jesus did is because we have lots of doctor\n",

      "jesus and messianic prophecy \" hey . i do n't know if this is technically where i should be posting this ; sorry if it 's not . ) fine , if \" retort \" is n't appropriate then i 'll use \" counter - argue \" - that is the meaning i was trying to get across . but i think all your other points are too strict and therefore not in keeping with wikipedia 's guidelines or encyclopedia guidelines in general . ) you said : \" christians retort that the messianic prophecies never specified a time - line for the messiah 's actions , and the new testament , especially the book of revelation , detail how some of the prophecies will come to f ru ition later . . this is a bit vague and raises some questions . which christians ? where did they say that ? how did they detail it ? can you reference it from a notable semi - notable scholar ? \" first , i ca n't point to a place in the old testament where the time - line does n't exist , you know what i mean ? there is no jewish time - line so it can not be referenced . but the new testament does have a christian time - line , as detailed in the book of revelation . now , which christians hold to this belief ? essentially all of them - all that have a moderate to literal interpretation of the bible , which is essentially all . where did christian authors detail this belief ? in the bible ! how did they detail it ? they wrote it in the bible ! that is why i made bible references ! which scholar can i quote ? how about john the apostle , who wrote revelation ? is one of the founders of christianity an acceptable source on the subject ? i find you taking objection to this equivalent to someone writing , \" christians believe jesus came back from the dead , as detailed in various places , including the gospels , \" and then you coming around asking for scholarly sources and not accepting bible passages and asking , \" which christians believe that ? \" . ) you said : this includes jesus ruling an earthly paradise after the apocalypse ( revelation - ) . , although it does reference the bible , if left alone , it sounds rather confusing . it also does not specifically reference a line from revelation , nor does it reference which version of the bible it quotes ( king james , ni v , etc ) which could mean a slight difference in the quote . if you want many specific bible quotes then i 'll put those in , and i 'll list if its kj v or whatever . but i do n't think that 's required as my broad citation of rev - does clearly explain exactly what i 'm talking about , including a physical kingdom on earth , a messianic age of righteousness and so on . just because i did n't dis sect it and show a specific line for each point does n't mean they are n't there - any interested reader can easily find them by reading those chapters . if i had written , \" the story of noah 's ark is in genesis - , \" would you have deleted my entry and said its citation is too vague ? just because i did n't give a synopsis with ten references does n't mean it 's unworthy ; just look it up ! ) what bothers me most is how this whole thing started when i tried to correct incorrect data on your site ( the line that christians do n't believe in a physical resurrection ) . that line had no references ! so even if my references are vague they still trump the initial post , do n't they ? you ca n't delete my post for dubious citation then restore something with no references at all . ) i 'm sure you 'll disagree with me on this one , but most of all , i think that my contribution did n't need to cite anything as it is such common knowledge that christians believe in judgment day , an age of peace etc . i feel like i 'm in some kind of twilight zone defending this belief . it 's almost as bad as someone posting , \" christians do n't believe jesus was tried , executed and came back to life , \" then i post that they do , citing luke - , then you saying that it is too vague etc . it was pure courtesy to give the citation - it 's such common knowledge that christians believe these things ! but whatever - i 'll repost with a several more - specific quotes . and btw , you may think , \" whoa , this guy care way too much about wikipedia ( and i 'm a mod ) , \" but this is about preventing my religion from being misrepresented .

      "let 's put it this way flo , everyone has talked past me here for months . it is absolutely frustrating to have everything i contribute get labeled as \" disruptive . \" disruptive , how ? ted enti ous , how ? i sure as heck do n't feel that i have done so because as far as i 'm concerned i 've acted in good faith trying to make wikipedia the best it can be . if you want to explain the rules to me and how i can be who i am on wikipedia and stay within the rules , i 'm all ears . i just want fm to leave me alone . how would you feel if you were new on a site and everything you did was declared illegal by people who disagree with you when there is a pretence to neutrality without any explanation ? if you have done such a good job explaining everything to me , then why do i feel that i 've been ganged up on without just cause ? i know a lot of people who feel that wikipedia has a definite bias when it comes to politics and religion that 's not very positive . why not listen to me ? what do you all have to lose ? my faith is the core of my being , and it 's who i am . do you expect me to junk my worldview to contribute to wikipedia ? have any of you stopped to consider how your own world views contributes to how you interpret the rules ? do you care how ordinary readers view wikipedia ? you probably do , or else you would n't be here . the fact is traditionally minded christians number over billion people on this planet , and close to million in the united states alone . that 's not some tiny crackpot minority out there . if i feel attacked by wikipedia , or feel that my pov is misrepresented , how do you think they feel reading wikipedia ? let 's face it here , factually , the perspective represented in the articles in the dominionism series , from my perspective , seem to o vere mph asi ze the views of a small minority in the united states regarding the christian right . why should my work be reversed when i elaborate on the dom ini onist 's pov , which btw , i do n't agree with , for the sake of ensuring fairness . or when fm , removes something i wrote from a reputable evangelical ministry critical of christian re con str uc tionist theology ? he tells me it 's false or that i 'm pov pushing . how ? i cited the sources , which are widely respected in evangelical circles . what am i supposed to think when s of the article is devoted to the opponents of the christian right , who by the way are a minority of the total american population . bush won twice because of their support and elected the gop to congress and a majority of the state houses . katherine yu rica 's and the oc rac y watch 's pov represents a minority of the population . i have no idea where you live . perhaps their perspectives are popular among your friends , but they do n't represent the larger picture . how is writing from the majority perspective pov pushing or giving undue weight to my perspective , considering it 's the perspective of just a little over percent of the american population . i suggested banning partisanship as part of the npov rule and consensus rule , but feloniousmonk reverted my changes that had been made by a previous editor . when he does that , what am i supposed to think about his motives ? i do n't know him , and he has n't exactly been the most friendly person to me since day one . have you ever stopped to think , it 's not what you say , but how you say it ? the tone from yourself and the other admins has kept me on the defensive , and what am i supposed to think , other than what i 've said ad na use am ? i feel attacked , not consulted with . so far , i feel that no one has explained anything about their perspectives to me except for what comes across on my screen in my mind as person attack . things like wp : pov , wp : point etc . , that get put up when i feel that i have done nothing wrong comes across as a personal attack instead of . could you consider rephrasing it this way , or this is how you should be doing this . that 's constructive in my view . instead of hur ling rules at me , the interpretations of which i disagree with , tell me why you think i stepped over the line and your rationale . i react positively to reasoned explanations , not summary reversals of my work , accusations of pov pushing , etc . , without explanation . maybe you 've been at this for awhile , so you take things for granted . i simply go to the rulebook and fail to see where all of you are getting your opinions from . interpretation my friend . i want to understand your interpretation , and why you interpret the rules the way you do . every time i do anything , from asking people what they think about the rules , or my ideas for improving wikipedia , i get written up on this rfc . flo , please do n't take this personally , percent of the time , i simply forget to login , not thinking there is any problem with my editing without logging\n",

      "actually , i do n't think it 's particularly ' enlightening ' at all ! first , the essay implies that a person may be inclined to view a number of edits as coming from ' the same person ' . i view that implication as an example of a ' straw - man argument ' : a person builds up an ( intentionally weak or flawed ) argument , solely for the purposes of knocking it down . that 's not particularly enlightening , except that it reveals that people generally have more luck knocking down a position if they 've built it up , specially , just for that purpose . i view the matter more as an example of a commonality of self - selection : consider that if you 're at the top of el cap itan ( natural rock pillar ) , you will find ( generally ) two types of people : . very rich people who can ( and do ) hire a helicopter to fly there . very capable , enthusiastic , and competent rock climbers . in other words , you do n't find there many people who are both poor and handicapped , merely because of where you happen to be . ( and , if you 're actually there , chances are that you , too , are either rich or a very good rock c li m ber . wikipedia is , quite likely , a ' magnet ' for ' control freaks ' . ( and others , obviously . ) i 've read comments that some editors make tens of thousands of edits . while i could say , \" get a life ! \" , i do n't view such enthusiasm as inherently bad , wrong , or a problem . but , i think there may very well be an association between ocd - type ( obsessive - compulsive disorder ) editing , and ' control - freak ' behavior . there are other clues that must be considered . a person who is acting out a ' control - freak ' fantasy , wants to control as much as possible . apparently , wp has made it quite easy to ' revert ' to a previous edit . that ability is not necessarily bad ( against vandals ) , but it implicitly encourages a kind of ' all or nothing ' reaction : if a ' control - freak ' wishes to manipulate , as much ( and as many ) as possible , it 's far easier to simply ' revert ' all of an edit , rather than ( carefully and selectively ) remove only as much of a ' problem ' as actually exists . ever heard an old saying , \" when the only tool you have is a hammer , you tend to treat all problems as if they were nails . \" one of the most ' inefficient ' routes , from the standpoint of a ' control - freak ' , is to actually stick around and dispute the propriety of the original edit , and the characteristics of the ' control - freak 's actions . a ' control - freak ' gets his j ol lies , most readily , by undoing what others have done . ( the ' control - freak ' feels , explicitly or implicitly , that he does n't have to ' justify ' the status of the article before his victim 's edit ! ) . if the ' control freak ' must actually distinguish between ' proper ' posting and ' improper ' posting sections , he becomes far less ' efficient ' at manipulating others . ( he must spend far more ' valuable ' ( in his not - so - humble opinion ) time reading , and distinguishing , rather than merely reverting ! consider a hypothetical ' war ' between a person who is making a ' house of cards ' , and another person who views it as his task to impede the first : the latter person needs merely show up for a second or two , every few minutes , and knock down the ' house of cards ' . minutes or hours of work is gone , in a moment ! very ' efficient ' , from the standpoint of the ' control freak ' , but not for his victim . worse , if the ' control freak ' must first obtain a consensus ( something which wp ostensibly requires ) he is power fully im pe ded from ex cer c ising his ' control - freak ' tendencies . ( i am not considering , here , raw ' vandalism ' , of course : very arguably , it should be easy to completely revert actual , genuine ' vandalism ' . ) it is not surprising , therefore , that ' control - freaks ' are far more likely to simply revert all of an edit , quickly , preventing consensus , and refusing to justify it in any actual discussion . thus , i notice that ( in , so far , every case ) , every ' drive - by deletion ' to which i have been a victim involves a person who reverts all of my edits ( check ! ) , and not merely a portion of them ( check ! ) and who does so very quickly ( check ! ) , who prevents any sort of consensus from forming ( check ! ) , and who does n't bother to stick around to debate the propriety of the original posting , or the ' freak 's ' abrupt eras ures ( check ! ) . aha ! things are getting quite clear , at least from the standpoint of the ' control - freak ' in question . but why should a flock of others try criticize the victim , and not the ' control freak ' ? is it because i think ' they 're the same person ' ? ( ' straw - man argument ' ) no ! consider another saying , \" birds of a feather flock together \" . if there were only a single ' control - freak ' in the world , nobody else would have any motivation to assist him , or to help vic ti mi ze his victims . but there are many ' control - freaks ' , and each understands that if one ' control freak ' gets im pe ded , prohibited , or criticized , or exposed , the next one could be them ! after all , i\n",

      "more on protocols procedures courtesy hi bov , thanks so much for your kind reply . our discussion was getting so long it was unwieldy to scroll though , so i thought i 'd continue under a new heading . hope you have no objection . i 'm still under the gun with that project i mentioned and am amazed that my last note was as long as it is ! wanted to reply to a few points for the moment . i 'm using numbered points because it makes it easier for you ( and me ) to refer back to . reg ar ding n my making a clear distinction between me us and \" your editorial colleagues \" , yes , you 're right . i guess i do n't know enough about wikip yet , but i clearly do n't have access to the same \" additional facilities \" ( which i take to mean \" tools \" ) as you , so i do n't have the same control . sure , i could put a copyvio on someone 's page , but i rather doubt it would stay there any more than my { db } s did i assume copyvio notices are either . sent to all admins ( or those who deal with copyvios specifically ) , and or . posted to the copyvio page for you and your colleagues to make some sort of determination on . from what you say above , it appears that some uber admin ( s ) makes the final determination . also regarding \" tools \" i and , i suspect , most wikip contributors have no power to lock and page to insure it does n't get reverted by anyone else . nor can we delete a page , even our own . nor do we have access , as i assume you do , to eb and other pay services to check for likely infringements . there are even several services used by educational institutions which faculty regularly use to check for plagiarism in term papers , theses , etc . perhaps you also have access to those ? you did n't indicate how that eb page was accessed since the public can only get the \" teaser \" entry for crap sey . thus , to paraphrase your quote and the old axiom : \" we are all peers , with equal power to edit , but some of us are more equal than others ! \" . regarding your statement that it 's \" actually relatively rare for a copyvio to be contested , and most pass without comment , \" are you saying that once a copyvio is pointed out , the \" offending contributor \" simply concedes the point and allows the page to be removed without so much an objection ? ! that 's truly ast ou on ding i 'd imagine that most folks do not deliberately borrow from others , however similiar the contents might be . have no idea what you mean by \" the ones that are contested often end up in the sections at the top of the page . \" can you point me to a sample of this ? . regarding your statement that \" he eb page i 'm referring to is , the one originally referenced what do you mean ? referenced by whom ? by your colleague ? or are you ob li quely saying that wikip has the means of reading contributor hard drive c aches and recent url lists to determine where they 've been ? ! i know i did n't reference eb and do n't know how you access their pay service , but if you 're in fact suggesting that wikip can somehow monitor member hard drives , i 'd find that very disturbing . an outright privacy violation . will run ad aware & spy bot s & d ; just to see if anything they regard as \" malicious \" turns up with wikip fingerprints on it ! ; - ) . on your reply to above that \" wikipedia does not , in general , use text ' with permission , ' \" i 'm confused . the passage i quoted suggests that the authors are granting wikip a gfdl \" license , \" which , from my understanding of the law , means \" with permission . \" the author still \" owns \" the material and , presumably can make whatever other use s he wants of it but can not expect payment from wikip , restrict the editing of , or , for that matter , even withdraw permission for work submitted to wikip . regarding your answer to above that you \" do n't have access to any special posting info . it 's all available to everyone , although some of it is better hidden or harder to use , \" this sort of relates to my immediately above , and i guess i 'm confused again . how in the world would admins and other \" watchers \" like you ( still do n't know what your title is ) know \" what 's new \" on wikip if you do n't get notices or have some list you can comb through ? are you saying there 's an actual public list of all new articles ? if so , where is it , and what prompts you folks to check one article vs . another ? again , thanks . will try and get back later or tomorrow\n",

( not french - sorry ker im ! ) to be honest i do n't like my german lessons . the teaching format is , for me , very unconventional . there is very little reading and writing - almost nothing . instead we are ' supposed ' to learn through talking and repeating . while i know this will be perfect for some , not everyone can learn in this way . i sure you know the three ways people learn : a ural , visual and kin es tic . well i know i 'm a mixture of visual and kin es tic . and when it comes to learning a language i have to see it written on paper , write it several times and actually use the words . also she , the teacher , is not supposed to talk in english . which begs the question how can she explain something complex without explaining to us in our own language . ok , enough moaning about german ! thankfully i am not suffering from spending yesterday evening in the gym . i am hoping that i become addicted to the place and that i * have * to go to get my ' fix ' . tomorrow i have a fitness assessment which will be interesting . next week will be the induction and i shall be given a program to follow . they also have lots of classes which is one of the reasons i chose to join this gym . along with the muscle fitness classes they also have more relaxing classes : yoga , p il ates , etc . which i quite like . i find listening understanding the class instructor hard enough in english , so to do it in german will be amusing ! the gym i go to is in the centre but there is one closer to my home ; not too sure how to get there though . el vir a was n't pleased when i told her the showers and sa un as are mixed ! you know how jealous those lat inas are ; - ) ok , time for me to leave you in peace . please give my greetings to all and you take care . i shall be in touch again soon . be si tos , dave\n",

      "hi again dear yes i strongly support independence of \" south azerbaijan \" from iran , if green movement could change somethings , probably i would change my idea , but i dont want to be under islamic re jim anymore and i support the changing of destiny of azerbaijani people . and about \" azerbaijanis are turks or not \" . despite you are talking about persian theory of the roots of turkish people , we all know that turks started to migrate here circa ad when sal ju k turks of west branch ( oghuz ) started to come , but infact it is not important when they came here . the important thing is \" every one \" in azerbaijan feel themselves as azerbaijani ( and not azeri which is an invented word by persians ) turks and believe that they r turks and speak turkish lang . as same as turks of turkey . you can come here and ask yourself one by one , you will see . it is so ir r ar ational to say to some one that : \" no , you r not turk , you dont know who you are ! i know ! you r azeri and azeris are indo european . \" pls dont tell us who we r ! let us to identify ourselves and we identify ourselves as a turk whatever others like or not . about aran , as i know we didnt have \" ey al at aran \" in the q aj ar era . we had \" ey al at az arb ai jan \" and both azerbaijan rep . and armenia was part of this big ey al at as well as south azerbaijan . aran was part of this big land . but the important thing is , the name of land is not important here as well , the important thing is the people who live in azerbaijan rep . ( former aran as you called ) are of my race and we r same nation . you may call there azerbaijan or aran but the important thing is : \" here a nation live which called themselves azerbaijani turks ! \" . you may call them whatever you want as well as their land , the important thing is what they call themselves . if they change the name of their republic , will you satisfy ? what about next ? will you ask them to call themselves \" ar ani \" and start to speak \" ar anian \" language ! which does not exist ! ok let 's think azerbaijanis r not turk , so what they r ? azeri ? ok , let 's call them azeri , what is the next step ? you will ask them to forget to speak in turkish language and start to speak persian ? or not , speak azeri lang . ? so what is azeri lang . ? where is it ? can you learn it to about million people ? let 's thing pragmatic as well as rational . even if your theory of roots of this people is correct historically , you cant ask them to speak neither a lang . of years ago nor persian . also i dont rely neither to researches of kas ravi nor ze ht abi cos both were under some believes of their backgrounds and governments . one was pan ir anist other was pan turk ist . some of their researches looks really funny ! about the names of turkish places and cities , i guess you have never travel l to azerbaijan . if you were here , you 'll see that iranian government has changed the names during pahlavi era ! some of them are such a funny thing that r jokes between us . for example tabriz has a suburb in western part of the city called \" akh mag aya \" which in turkish means the rock which falling down and it is a rocky place , do u know what is its official name ? \" ah magi y yeh ! \" the lands of stupid people ! all of the turkish names tried to change to a persian words which looks verbally sim mi lar them ! the fact is persian never have been to azerbaijan . most of the azerbaijani names have armenian or tat roots not persian . my believe is that a mixture of differ net na ti os like t ats , armenians , and other caucasian tribes lived here and then turkish tribes of western branch have migrated to this land in large size and get married with the native people and has made the new nation which called azerbaijani turks nowadays . they have their own culture , music , dance , cuisine etc . which seperate them form persians and interestingly this culture is like culture of turks of anatolia which believes that they r percent turk ! i told you history is not important than today , the important thing is every one here feel themselves as a turk . i dont know what they want us to feel in tehran ! the name of azar ab ade gan looks wrong as well . this word cant change to az arb ai jan during history . i guess the word was \" azar pay gan \" ( maybe ) which zoroastrian persians called , not azar abad gan which fer dow si mentioned in shah nam eh and everyone got to accept it now ! i had a look to your files about vote fra u ding which i still believe is correct as well . the diagrams of those . pdf pages show that people of iran will give their votes to ah ma din ez had when that company asked them before election , but you know there is un w ri tt enable rules in iran which every one know . whenever some one come and ask me in person that \" do u like islamic republic , ali kha men i and bla \" i will answer \" yes \" ! cos i dont want to lose my life ! we dont have life gu ar an ty\n",

      "notes for the blind communist castro lovers editing wikipedia and for the man him self there seems to be a group of people around here in wikipedia with very strong leftist tendency that are very blind as to no recognize castro for what he is . but not to worry . history will take care of him like it took care of hitler and stalin and other horrible dictators the people in the world have suffer . there is a lot of talk in wikipedia about having a neutral pov but there is no such thing here . all the castro 's agents and lovers are here polishing his image probably getting paid with free v ac ations by the dictator at var ad ero beach in cuba while many true cuban heroes die in prison just for opposing castro and what he represents . a decadent regime , a waste of time for the cuban people . castro i know you or your agents will read this . so do not worry . history will take care of you and be assure that you will not look this good as it appear here . you could have been great a great leader if you had help cuba get out of a dictator like batista and then surrender power to the people to democracy ! but you want to know something . you became worst than batista the moment you started killing many innocent people just at the beginning of the revolution . yourself killed the revolution with all the blood and with your unlimited greed for power . you claim cuba is the most democratic country in the world . \" right \" ! how many people prefer to die on the tooth of a shark better than at your hands ? how many desperate people abandon the island ? because there is no other choice ? or maybe because they are anyway dying an slow death at the hands of your regime , controlling every little bit of information as you an your agents are doing here at wikipedia . cleaning up your image ! it amazes me . because this goes to show what you are . a me gal omaniac ! too worry about what history will tell about you , about what your legacy will be . do not worry fidel castro . i will let you know this . do not even let yourself think for a second that you are at the same level as jose mar ti , fe li z va rel a or even a simon bo li var . you do not get even up one inch in front of them in fact i can tell you that you go down for miles and miles . you must be full of envy about chavez ! because his got the oil money you never had ! and because of it he can buy some people . but do not be ! some people are not for sale . some people will not buy the lies you sell . this is for you , all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime , and who f ant asi ze about castro and che i will also be sorry to disappoint you by telling you that you castro that you are not even at che 's level , yes the same one you made a martyr , an icon of the revolution , your first patron saint . the same one you sell in t - shirts and post cards now and you profit from ! that is because at least che had principles , something you really do not know what it is or even fathom , he ( che ) probably believe in communism and that it was a good thing because of his youth , while on the other hand you castro just used it for your own personal benefit and profit . ask yourself why che die ? why cam ilo ci en fu egos die ? and many others close to power in cuba ? many people said that castro himself send someone to kill him ! he just can not stand someone close to power ( because he is very afraid to loose it he is paranoid about it , ob sess with power , anybody close to him have to be very careful no to upset him or to contradict any of his ideas even the bad ones . poor guys , i am sorry for them . castro have sub ju gated and dominated the cuban people who have suffer for years without end his power and very long rants . but no more . just like everything that is born some day you too fidel castro will also die sooner or later . do not worry , when you die we the cubans enjoying freedom will not celebrate your death but will rejoice about the change that will happen to our homeland after you will be gone . sorry to see all the time wasted but not to worry . cuba will be rebuild . all the cuban blood you have spilled in and out of the country will not be in van e . you know why that will be ? because , cubans will have learn their lesson . for you , all the leftist who have never live in a totalitarian regime , believe me if you impartially read all the news about fidel castro and check all his speeches from the very beginning of the revolution you can see his evolution . how power have corrupted him and his regime . how many innocent people have been kill in the name of the revolution ? how much intolerance ! how many times he has sell out his \" principles \" . just to refresh old memories cuba was suppose to be for cubans at the beginning of the revolution . for a while now because the commander was afraid of loosing his grip on power he had to\n",

      "but if it be a sin to co vet honour , i am the most offending soul alive . \" ) \" it is simply a fact that many critics of sarfatti are very negative about his theories and speculations . \" false . you have not given even one valid example of that . i doubt you would be able to understand what the physics is about anyway . you can not produce even one objective valid refutation of any of my physics ideas by anyone . ch saying \" it 's nonsense \" is not objective . it 's not valid . it is not rationally argued . no reasons are given . also i retracted my f tl communication idea years ago . furthermore , making a mistake in physics does not make one into a crackpot ! also , you have suppressed the fact that i predicted the super solid decades before it was discovered and before tony leg gett , who gets the credit published his paper . george chap line and david finkelstein confirm that in writing and you have consistently deleted that important factual information from the article . that is hardly fair is it ? ) \" it is also a fact that usenet is not the usual venue for publishing even highly unconventional ideas in physics . \" sez who ? that is exactly what usenet should be for ! instant world wide communication of important ideas not the crap that most idiots put on it . peer review is a joke in physics today . everyone in the field knows it . the free market place of ideas is supposed to be the wiki idea , or am i wrong ? mainstream journals do not publish unconventional ideas ! what planet are you on ? ) sarfatti has been considered negatively by many since his involvment with par ap hy sics dating back to ths s , long before the exist ince of usenet , for which i have pro ve i ded reputable sources ( and can provide more ) . stop right there ! you just committed a hate crime ! are you above the law ? so working on paranormal stuff automatically makes one a crackpot ? is that your position ? that 's like saying it 's ok to lynch niggers because they are less than human . same idea . think about it . sarfatti thinking outside the box means he is not entitled to the same respect as someone taking the safe boring path through life . who are your reputable sources ? show them . martin gardner ? show where his exact text justifies your false extrapolation . also , i do not in hold to the same ideas i did in ! why focus on and exclude ? ) it is also a fact that were it not for his provocative statements and the largely negative reaction to them , sarfatti would not be in any way notable . false . i would be notable for several ideas in physics . the quotations by david finkelstein , lenny sus s kind , george chap line and tony smith prove that . it 's ok to say \" negative reaction \" , but it 's not ok to lynch me and defame me with putting \" crank \" and \" crackpot \" on a very scant article in such a way that is the key message the casual reader will go away from . now any lawyer will tell you are treading on shaky ground if you do that and can not prove your case should it ever go to court . this is not a threat . i am on several tv shows and i am in paramount pictures star trek . that does not make me notable . i am cited in several popular books . that also makes me notable . for example , herbert gold 's book bohemia , not to mention the dancing wu li master that i ghost wrote most of for gary zuk av and that sold a j il lion copies and is still selling after years . my original space - time and beyond sold fairly well also . so look david e . siegel from two independence way suite , princeton nj , your research on me is pure sh lock . it 's fragmentary and it gives a completely distorted image of who i really am and what i really think and why i am notable ! ) \" now , none of that means that his critics are correct . it is true that many well - known people are stro gly attacked , and it is also true that many eventually widely acc c ep ted scientific ideas are considered absurd and crank ish early in their history . ( continental drift comes to mind and there are many other examples . ) it is possible ( although i belive unlikely ) that sarfatti 's ideas will be similarly respected in the future . ( of course that fact that many respected theories were once thought crank ish does not alter the fact that most ideas thought crank ish are always so regarded the crank th ory that proves correct is a rare beast . ) \" ok , that 's enough you sob ! i have several mainstream papers of importance that are recognized . details were systematically vandalized from the article . prediction of the super solid is a key one . that alone makes me notable as a physicist . you defame me here and you maliciously suppress the facts . you owe me a big public apology ! so what you sysop geeks are above the law here ? you can defame me , but i ca n't defend myself ? this is still american not the soviet gulag ! ) \" but the fact is that his reputation as\n",

      "this is wrong why is this article called ( and sty lised ) ' wwe friday night smackdown ! ' ? here is that not the name of the show ? i guess . i was thinking it should be called ' wwe smackdown ' , like wwe raw ( although it 's not written in upper case letters , and does n't say monday night , which is now understandable when you consider the name of the show logo and all ) . speaking of which , there is no longer an ex cla i mation mark when smackdown is concerned , not in text or logo - so something should definitely be done about that . it also makes articles incoherent when editors sty li se it that way . here not in the logo ? ok . : the official name is \" wwe fir day night smackdown ! \" , all you have to do is watch smackdown to see that . spyke then the other article should be called ' wwe raw ' . here : , january ( utc ) it is called \" wwe raw \" . no because \" raw \" is only referring to the \" brand \" of wwe . \" raw \" is name of the \" television show \" , like \" friday night smackdown ! \" and \" extreme championship wrestling \" . talk the new logo on the show now only says smackdown , so should the title be changed accordingly ? there still seems to be some confusion in wwe sources though , with the website still calling it friday night smackdown ! the oficial name of smackdown , as of february is \" wwe friday night smackdown \" , ther is no log er a \" ! \" in the logo , and you ca n't tell , by the logo , that you have t the top of the page , becuase it is nearly two years out of date ! preceding unsigned comment added by . how about actually watching smackdown ! for once ? : wo h . this changes everything . did anyone notice anything different on this friday 's edition of smackdown ( hint , hint ) ? : the logo no longer says \" friday night . \" at the same time , the announcers still refered to it as friday night smackdown . actually if you notice that the smackdown ! logo does still say friday night but no longer contains the ! . but does include the wwe logo before friday night . preceding unsigned comment added by ( talk contribs ) : , jan u ar\n",

      "lack of any clue as to why people would continue to vote for this guy \" why is this our concern ? : \" a person does n't manage to hold elective public office for years without having some positive attributes to recommend him to people . \" this reads like or in theory of voter behavior . i 'd love to talk to you more about this but this is a talk page in content space . can we please limit our discussion to the article ? thanks : \" a person does n't manage to hold elective public office for years without having some positive attributes to recommend him to people . \" positive attributes help one hold office , but so does money . a partial clarification of the apparent discrepancy you identify would be to include in the article better coverage of the fund balances in the subject 's many political action committees , but something tells me you might get all apo ple c tic if i added those numbers . : wp does not require us to ensure that every article about a politician must read such that it is plausible that they would be elected and re - elected , unless there is some guideline with which i am not familar : when a biographical article about a successful politician makes it difficult to discern why anyone ever might have voted for him ( other than the possibility of favors , which can not possibly have been granted to the entire electorate ) , that 's an indication that the article is more of a character assassination piece than a balanced biography . : i 'm interested in theories of voter behavior but it is not relevant here . here we are concerned with faithfully summarizing the events of one life as reported in rs . i 'm not aware of any rs that reports on why the good people of the th ward vote like they do : say it 's the morning after an election day . say there 's a living person with a wp article in the election . are all wp editors obligated to review the election results , and make sure that the balance of \" positive \" and \" negative \" in your judgement reflects the election results ? so if a candidate gets of the popular vote the article should be \" positive \" in your judgement and at most \" negative \" in your judgement ? or even , without knowing the s , all re - elected in cum b ents should have pleasant content and at most unpleasant ? and all this can be done without anyone looking at rs beyond the election results ? : please know i completely understand how one could read this and think omg that ca n't be true it must be blp violation . welcome to my world : i have compared this article with the one about [ wiki link : edward vr dol yak ed vr dol yak ] ( among others ) . the vr dol yak article suffers from a serious lack of sourcing , but i feel that it provides a more coherent and balanced \" story \" of his career than the burke article did . it would not make me want to rush out vote for the guy , but it does provide a big - picture view of what he is was good at and how he conducted business as a politician . note in particular that the article headings are objective and encyclopedia - like . in contrast , the burke article was a litany of individual incidents , most of which were highlighted with tabloid - style headlines . : \" it would not make me want to rush out vote for the guy \" where are you getting this ? i must ask you to please site specific wp guidelines in your replies . we seem to be getting lost in non - standard criteria for undue . again : a wp article about a politician must explain his success at the polls ? no . a wp article must faithfully summarize rs . if you would like to advocate for other criteria may i respectfully suggest undue talk . thank you . : \" tabloid - style headlines \" sigh . i thought we were past this . if you have concerns th ast some sources are not rs , i must ask you again to pls be specific . thank you ! : \" balanced \" story \" of his career \" from the wp pov there is no story other than as documented in rs . you seem to be comparing this article against some story you have in mind which you seem to think must exist . if you are aware of rs which states that the subject is heavily involved in animal rescue or whatever pls add it . thanks : \" the article is more of a character assassination piece than a balanced biography \" not a balanced biography ? another thought experiment on balance , bare with me . say you bought a biography of burke , you know , old school , a book , with money . say you run into a friend from chicago and mention that you read a biography , and your chicago an freind remarks \" that 's great ! say , crazy how he sk at edon that ghost pay rolling dust - up , huh ? \" and you 're like , wha ? and you go back home and check your book , no mention of ghost pay rolling , no martinez in the index , would n't you want your money back ? : \" accusations \" i ask again can you please be more specific ? i do n't know what you mean by accusations . all i see is summaries of rs . all i see are the events and activities of a life . : \" lacks balance because it omits a balanced treatment of the negative aspects of his career \" i 'm lost here . i have no idea what this means . can you please cite this idea in wp guidelines ? that might help . : like th ward , most of the various items that make up this article are lacking in context . example : \" in john j . wis nie wski , an administrative assistant with the city 's department of urban renewal , and a p rec in ct captain in the th ward for years , was fired from his city job . mr . wis nie wski stated that filing to run as an independent candidate for al derman against burke was why he was fired . \" : this is a description of an accusation against burke . i want to know more about it , but i can not access the newspaper article on which this snippet is based , nor have i been able to find online sources . i can not determine whether or when wis nie wski ran against burke , nor what investigations or actions followed from this accusation . it appears to me that this is based on a single newspaper article . without further information context , it does n't look to me like it 's a salient element of burke 's biography . : \" i can not access the newspaper article on which this snippet is based , nor have i been able to find online sources . \" thanks for sharing this . this is real progress . this must be very frustrating for you , not having good online sources . i am blessed with a wonderful public library in my home town , with awesome online databases , without which i could not do what i do on wp . since forming judgements of undue depends so critically on rs it seems like it would be very difficult to justify edits based on undue . thanks again : it would be nice to place this in the context of other facts of burke 's career . did wis nie wski oppose burke in , then get fired ( allegedly for that opposition ) in ? or did he announce in that he was going to oppose burke in ? the sources and article indicate that was the last time he faced a challenger before . what happened in that election ? was wis nie wski the only challenger then ? ( was he the \" veteran p rec in ct captain \" who tried to get the com mi tt e eman seat in ? ) i imagine that your sources would provide some needed clarification . : additionally , i have the impression that observers of chicago politics have formed perspectives opinions about burke over the last years , and that many of the incidents described here are key elements of the patterns they have observed . for example , observers might have said that he has a long record of hiring his relatives for city jobs ( i do n't think that 's the case with him ; this is just a made - up example ) or that he has used his skill as an effective builder of alliances in city government to build an un ass ail able power base on the finance committee ( that 's also made - up , but it 's a bit closer to what i think might have been said of burke ) . those kinds of statements ( attributed to their sources ) could form the topic sentence for a paragraph or section that describes various instances that are related to the topic sentence . the level of detail in the various descriptions of incidents still would be excessive ( e . g . , \" , for the sidewalk , , for the wrought - iron fence \" ) , but at least the various stories might connect to something . : balance does not mean everyone has a some good and some bad in them , weight in wp content is relative to rs : \" due and undue weight neutrality requires that each article or other page in the mainspace fairly represents all significant viewpoints that have been published by reliable sources , in proportion to the prominence of each viewpoint . . keep in mind that , in determining proper weight , we consider a viewpoint 's prevalence in reliable sources . \" emphasis mine . i think it will help if you please paraphrase your understanding of this standard in your own words . thanks\n",

      "in order to reduce the amount of text we are generating on your talk page i have gone ahead and moved my original proposal post over to the user page of my \" sandbox account \" . i needed to input some text there in order to \" knock it \" out of its default \" edit mode \" and that standalone post seemed like a good candidate for a chunk of text to post over there . so now my \" sandbox account \" contains the initial ( but kept current ) proposal for the suggested pst improvement on the user page [ external link : here ] and the latest version of the strawman implementation of that proposal on the talk page [ external link : here ] . let 's keep the ongoing discussion of the proposal strawman implementation on your talk page ( below ) for now . as we reach closure on issues that arise here we could perhaps also use the user page of my \" sandbox account \" for archiving further chunks of text off of your talk page to further reduce the clutter here . * status of this section : i broke this section off from the remainder of the text that was in it ( which is now a new section immediately below ) because it effectively contains my initial proposal ( which was originally a posted comment to you at this very point on your talk page ) . i still feel that text is the best introduction for someone to the rationale behind the latest changes to the pst should they wish to take the trouble to inform themselves about it . that is why i keep it current with all the latest updates signed ( thus time stamped ) and or logged . plus by removing that text from here i was able to take control of it and keep it current and concise , while if it had remained here , by now it would be completely shot through with point - counterpoint discussion and it would be pretty useless to others as any sort of overview introduction justification , particularly those others who suffer from add and would shy away from pl ough ing through all the subsequent discourse here . : without this section remaining on your talk page nobody can easily find my proposal or sandbox , so i suggest that you keep this section in place here as long as there is some other section addressing the latest pst upgrade still active and ongoing below it . how you resolve doing that with your own self - confessed anal attitude towards only archiving text in chronological order i 'm afraid i can not help you . but there a few sections below for which it would probably be better that they were archived sooner rather than later ( if anyone other than the two of us are to make sense of what is left ) . maybe for now you can make an exception to your normal archiving methodology and archive the text of this section without actually deleting it here yet , and then only delete this section once everything else pst - related below it is complete and all issues have been resolved . : i have no intention of adding anything to this section ( so from that perspective it can be archived right now ) . it simply needs to remain anchored here because it points to the two places where i regularly do make changes as my ideas for upgrading the pst evolve , not to mention as the mancini squads in question evolve too ! : talk : tou che , i 'll keep it here . i 'll work on archiving the other bits tomorrow . right now i need to get some sleep . initial discussion of the possible phasing of the proposed changes to the pst note : i 've now made this chunk of text from the end of the previous section its own new section here talk : i 'd be happy to roll this out . i see in the other sandbox linked that you 've only got the one column stating squad statuses - are you just waiting for the official announcements of the squads for each competition ? before , you had the three columns . i 'm willing to go with your not adding certain fringe members , too - see my recent comments further up my talk page where i essentially say that i 'm willing to drop the issue for the sake of peace of mind - though i 'd appreciate getting those outside judgments before going any further with it . : i consider this to be a two phase process . phase is adding the \" squad status \" column as an \" attribute \" of each player . and that is the version of the \" updated pst section \" that is in the talk page of the sandbox account created by gonads ( with just that one column added along with the defining text and table ) . phase is adding the third \" squad \" columns in each of the epl and europa cup competition columns to the above phase update after that has been \" rolled out \" ( as you just assured me you are about to do ) . the current status of the phase updates and experimentation with the ideas we are throwing around is in the talk page of my own sandbox account ( \" mancini 's sandbox \" ) . the user page of that same sandbox account contains my \" archived \" ( but nevertheless kept current with the latest developments ) text of my original proposal ( as explained in the text in the previous section above ) . : the reason for the phasing is because the addition of the \" squad status \" column is relatively un contentious , but more importantly , it also contains information that people need now as they try and work out what the new - man squad provisions entail for their favorite epl teams ' squads come the start of the season end of this month . otoh , we clearly have quite a few issues to resolve before we can come up with a complete and elegant solution for phase . not only that , even if we had the design all sorted out , ready to go and pat today , we still could not publish phase because we do n't know the actual - man squads until they are announced for each of the two competitions come august . anything published by us before that date would be un ci table speculation on our parts . so we have minimally until the end of this month to get the design of phase sorted out . once published , phase will also take on a life of its own ( i 'm assuming ) and will be improved by other editors , rather than simply reverted because it was \" not invented here \" and or posted by a newbie . which is why i want you to post it . : having said all that , the issues you raised in your last paragraph in the next section below re the fact that uefa have slightly different stated requirements stat i for \" hgp \" players is pertinent to the phase updates ( and , of course , phase because it sub sum es phase ) . so , since you have not done the roll out of phase yet , perhaps you should wait a little longer ( omg , i hate to hear myself say that ! ) until i can follow all the implications of that issue through to their conclusions and fix it accordingly ( if it needs fixing ) . i 'll post back here ( as an indent to this post ) when i think it is ready to go ( it will probably be later today for me , but it may be beyond midnight your time ) . alternatively , you could go ahead with the roll out of the phase release tonight and i 'll do the fixes ( if any required ) in the actual article . but we 've waited all this time since the weekend with the table ready to go so i guess another day will not hurt . : i believe the prior \" hgp acg \" distinction in the pst squad stat i already took care of this issue , and that you acknowledged such with your , \" we 're in agreement . and yeah , you actually did capture that disagreement , my bad \" statement in the next section below . issue closed . if you agree , just delete this italicized update comment and the now italicized text of the paragraph above . talk : any changes to phase ( as it currently is in [ external link : this sandbox ] ) . ( note : the contents of this sandbox are now completely different than what was being indicated at the time that comment was written . i 've chosen to add this later qualification here rather than modify the original text . ) talk . will possibly require coming up with a th ( and possibly even a th , etc . ) \" squad status \" code ( s ) and rec l assi fying some of the players accordingly ( if necessary ; it is possible to have valid \" squad status \" codes for which city currently do not have any players that fulfill that status ) , as well as adding to the table and inline introductory sections more text that defines the new \" squad status \" code ( s ) , and or modifying the current table and inline introductory section text that defines the current four \" squad status \" codes . one thing i 'm considering doing is adding a new column to my summarizing table that maps uefa terminology ( taken from the appropriate sections of the europa league and champions league rules and regulations wrt player eligibility ) to our own \" generic terminology \" that is a synthesis of both the epl and uefa terminology . of course , a column also needs to be added for the epl to map its \" player eligibility \" terminology to our own \" all embracing \" generic terminology , but like you , i still have n't seen the source text published by the premier league to rightly know what terminology actually is . : all of the issues addressed in the above preceding paragraph ( now italicized ) have been taken care of ( for over days now ! ) . one new squad status code ( \" yth \" ) was required and new columns were added to the summarizing table that effectively defines the squad status codes , plus all the preceding inline text was rewritten to be consistent with that new summary table . issue closed . you can delete this italicized paragraph plus the preceding one if you agree , otherwise explain below why you consider this issue still open . talk : consequently , such an update might best be rolled out as a phase a improvement to what we already have once i actually have the source text for all three competitions . i also need the equivalent text for the uefa super cup competition to do a complete job , but i really do n't want that stupid non - competition to hold things up here . the super cup does not involve any british teams so imo we have until the end of august next year to tweak anything that it might require . not only that , the two teams that play in it are also automatically qualified as defending champions in the two other main uefa competitions , so presumably their - uefa squad registrations for competing in either of those competitions simply carries over to the single super cup final game . or maybe the last - squad re - registrations of those teams simply applies . but it really does n't matter , does it , because i do n't necessarily see city playing in the super cup within the next year or so ! ( talk : the issue of the super cup that i raised in the preceding paragraph ( now italicized ) turns out to be a non - issue ( as i suspected it would be ) . i have now read the uefa \" player eligibility ' regulations for all three uefa competitions for the current - season and they all use essentially identical text . this text just has different article and section numbering depending on where it appears in each of the three uefa competition regulations documents ( actually it is only the super cup document section and article numbering that differs from the other two documents because , as one would expect , it is a much shorter doc um ment ) . thus the above non - issue is now closed and you can now delete this paragraph plus the preceding one . talk : take a look at the updates i 've done to the player squad status summary table ( that 's now my official name for it ; i 've been referring to it by all sorts of names up to this point ) in the [ external link : phase sandbox ] . ( note : the contents of this sandbox are now different than what was being indicated at the time that comment was written . i 've chosen to add this later qualification here rather than modify the original text . ) talk . as well as all the introductory inline text above it which i 've now completely rewritten to be consistent with the summary table below it . also check the parallel updates done [ external link : here ] . i 've tried to incorporate all the terminology that uefa uses in its \" player eligibility \" section of the \" europa league rules amd regulations \" pdf that you linked me to and map it to the existing terminology i was using via a new \" uefa terminology \" column in that table . i need to do a similar set of updates to the table in the new \" pl terminology \" column for the epl terminology when i can get my eyeballs on a similar pdf - for right now i 've written all the text in the entries in that new pl column by flying by the seat of my pants . : this represents what i had previously referred to as phase a . i 'm a little worried that all my text and table to define the new squad status codes now completely dwarfs your pst ( in which they represent just one column ) ! but they need explaining and this is the best i could do . we might be able to word smith the shit out of it and save a couple of paragraphs - worth of text , but i do n't see doing much better than that . possibly we could just keep the summary table and lose all that it is summarizing ! i need your feedback on this . i do n't feel very much like fiddling around with this much more , plus i do n't have the time . : note : i have already copied evey thing but the pst ( because that has the extra phase squad columns in it ) over to the other ( phase ) sandbox and this has now al res dy become the phase version ready for roll out . the season started yesterday , mancini has announced both his uefa squad ( at least of them ) and epl squad ( because he could not have fielded a team against spurs without having done so ) , although i have no idea where that first iteration of his epl squad has been published ; i 've personally still not seen it , but i bet my original hyper thetical one in my sandbox is still correct ! thus the interesting element of these squad codes has now become pretty moot - after all , why would anyone try and work out the upcoming squads for themselves once mancini has actually announced them ( or at least most of them ) ! : note : the above two leading paragraphs of this message were rewritten updated since you had still not replied to the previous two previous versions of this post and the latest updates above made it all old news . talk : just as an aside here , i 've also updated in that phase sandbox the europa league squad column from my earlier hypothetical - man squad to the list of mancini 's named players that was released today - it actually was n't that much different ! ) . both sandboxes reflect the removal of on u oha from the squad due to sunderland duty . the surprises in mancini 's - man europa league squad announced today is that it included michael johnson and sh ale um logan , neither of whom has kicked a ball publicly in any of the pre season games ( and accordingly i had just assumed johnson was still not fit yet and logan was playing with vidal and e tu hu over in the eds ) . so two europa slots left and mancini is stalling on what he intends to do with bellamy , ireland , silva and j . his - man squad contained strikers , mid fi el ders , defenders , and goalkeepers ( which i personally feel is an extra vag ance given that the club is allowed to draft in another go alie in an emergency situation if it has to - just like city did last season with f l p - and that given and hart have both been very vocal about not knowing what they are going to do if they do n't get the first choice go alie slot ) . : the current acg - hgp - for spread for the squad is - so any of the above four players could be added without restriction . as you pointed out elsewhere , the bal o tel li purchase , should it be completed , will not cost city a list a slot in the epl squad since he is under ( \" u \" status in the pst ) and can thus be list b registered to play in the epl , however bal o tel li no longer qualifies as a \" youth player \" ( \" yth \" status in the pst ) in the eyes of uefa as he did when still at inter milan , because he has not been at city days yet , let alone years ! consequently , bal o tel li will have to be registered for the uefa squad via a \" free player \" ( \" for \" status in the pst ) list a slot , and mancini can still do that in time for him to be able to play in the europa playoff game this week , because mancini is allowed to make one change to the squad that he originally registered for that tie last week . mancini can either replace someone ( such as santa cruz ) who is already registered via last week 's list a sub mitt al , or he can simply add super mario in one of the remaining two unused \" for \" slots . : the potential purchase of milner presumably accounts for mancini 's pro c ra st ination over the other slot that mancini left blank last week . bellamy 's loan to cardiff city today explained ( if one had not already guessed ! ) his omission from that first uefa squad sub mitt al , and the expected partial exchange of ireland in the milner deal also explains stevie 's omission from it too . personally , i felt that j had done enough to earn himself a place , and i 'm baffled why david silva was left out given all the money that has just been spent on him . it looks to me that mancini is still not quite sure which strikers he wants to use and where ( choose any two from santa cruz , silva and j ) . what are your thoughts on this ? talk : a large chunk of the above two paragraphs was rewritten at the same time this new message was posted . you stated on the august ( see your time stamped signature above ) , \" i 'd be happy to roll this out \" ( the actual text is up above in your firs paragraph ) and yet here we are a week later with no roll - out ? so what 's the problem ? all of the concerns you initially expressed re phase had been taken care of for two days by the august when i made my last batch of bold text responses in this section . note , the roll - out is not dependent on pee jay 's feedback on a completely different issue that relates to phase ( if at all ) and not phase . but here 's the problem i have my end . gonads stated he would not revert and then he did so without explaining why he went back on his word . now you 've gone and stated you 'll roll something out then you did n't without providing any explanation for why you have n't . you guys are coming across as a couple of bs artists . if you still have issues just say so and explain them . you also need to do some text ti dy up here and remove all text pertaining to issues that are now moot , or at least post something to say why you think they are still an issue . thanks . talk * status of this section : i think that most of the points raised here are now resolved , moot or old news - as you can determine from all my prior italicized text in this section where i was requesting that you remove such text as even then being redundant because it was essentially outdated status . it is especially old news given the subsequent roll out of the updated pst before your vacation - welcome back , btw . ) i think you need to go through the above dialogue ( actually , it is mostly a monologue ! ) in this section with a fresh pair of eyes on your return and satisfy yourself that all of the raised points have been satisfactorily resolved or have become non - issues - such as the phasing of pst updates ( since what you effectively rolled out was phase ) . should there be any point that you do n't understand or feel might still be an issue then respond to it - better still , make your response a pointer to a new section below where it can be further discussed until resolved . that way , you will be able to archive this section , otherwise it will remain open and potentially become even l eng thier and more complicated , and thus somewhat unmanageable . : imo there a couple of points raised above that are still unresolved but i feel that these issues have already been - or soon will be - touched on in some of the other ongoing sections , so i am hesitant to start yet more new sections here in order to specifically address them in their own right . just as an fyi they are : * the issue of what to do with all the inline text i generated . as i stated above , i 'm fully aware it dwarfs everything else in the article and what was rolled out was a good compromise . however it is still an open issue that needs to be resolved . : * some of my comments added on august re mancini 's ( then ) recently announced uefa squad for the europa league play - off round may be pertinent to the discussion in the new [ external link : \" squad re - registration issues \" ] section i created below . : so there might be a case to be made for preserving the last couple of paragraphs of that aug post going forward , but as for the rest of this section , from my perspective , it 's mostly old news and i 'm now completely done with it . : note that i have removed all the text bolding that was still in place in this section prior to my executing the edit to add this status message , because that bolding was pretty much added to make sure you saw all my updated status in a timely manner ( and did not miss any ) at the time that those comments were made , as well as to draw your attention to places where i had revised my prior text version . talk the need to cite reliable sources note : i 've now made this chunk of text from the end of the previous section its own new section here talk : incidentally , i believe kolarov 's number is now citable . [ external link : this article ] shows the club official picture at the un ve iling of the four new sign ings , and if you want a club source on that picture ( or rather , and equivalent ) , you can see one by skipping to the very end of [ external link : this os video ] . : yes , i saw the video ( i usually check in on the mcfc web site - which incidentally is imo the best one of all the epl teams , and i 'm not being sky - blue partisan when i say that - most days and minimally watch all the new videos ) and made the same mental note as you just pointed out when i saw kolarov and all the new players holding their allocated shirts up with mancini . i also liked some of that daily mail article , although , as a rule , i think the daily mail web articles are pretty crap . i recently gained a new level of respect for gary line ker for his quitting of the dm over the part the dm played in the lord tri es man fiasco . good on him . now , if only wayne rooney had such a conscience ! i usually stick to the bbc and the various club web sites for my soccer epl info . and possibly the guardian or the telegraph . and , of course , your very own wikipedia articles ! ) : here 's what i would like to do wrt kolarov and his new shirt number . roll out the phase pst , when we do roll it out , as is with his squad number starred as needing a citation , just so that people get used to seeing that concept in action . rather than use the dm article as the cited source ( which we could add right now ) i would prefer to see an mcfc web site source cited for it ( and not that minute long pres ser video either , but just a regular piece of text ) , so until that becomes available kolarov can remain there with his shirt requiring citation for as long as it takes . what 's more , if this process works properly , because of the \" citation needed \" prompt , someone will find the citation that 's required and add that missing citation for us at the bottom of the article and replace the asterisk next to his shirt number with the appropriate source reference superscript . but all this current crap of blanking his number for lack of citation , then someone else adding his number back in again , then someone blanking his number again , and on , needs to stop imo . it looks to the outsider to be as childish as it really is . : you might also need to go get people such as pee jay ( and possibly others ) to go read what i just wrote above ( as well as that s ruff over on my talk page re the carlos t vez example , etc . ) so that he buys into this concept too . it 's not as though it 's radical , because it 's how wikipedia is friggin ' meant to work ! so my suggestion is to use the kolarov squad number as an educational test case for others as i just outlined . let mr know your thoughts when you can . talk : i regard this as issue resolved now - kolarov 's number is now citable by virtue of bbc sport match reports which state player numbers if nothing else . : i 'm afraid you 've completely missed my point wrt rolling out the pst with kolarov 's new shirt number indicated \" citation needed \" . i am fully aware that his new shirt number can be supported with an rs citation , and that it could also have been when i wrote that text . sheesh , please give me some credit here . so the current ci tability of his new shirt number is a non - issue . non - issue now closed . however , the issue ( or culture ) of not putting true information into an article until after you have a citation to support it is not closed . because every phrase and fact within a wikipedia article does not require a citation - that would be way too an ally retentive ! - nor does every phrase or fact ( that you may wish to cite ) have to be correctly cited at the time it is first written in ( or added to ) an article - for those situations we have the \" citation needed \" qualification . please go back and re - read the above and let me know that you now comprehend the point of my suggested test case . once again , making such a test case over kolarov 's shirt number is also moot now ( because we rolled out the pst with an rs citation for it already included , thus that issue now closed ) . however , the need for such a test case as i was suggesting for kolarov is still an open issue from my perspective . please stay focused here . talk * status of this section : note : i created this new section immediately below the section of text from which i separated it so that you could more easily follow what i had done . however , since the first piece of text in this section is actually from august , it probably should be moved lower down your talk page if you want to keep your sections in strict chronological order based on the first posted message in each of them . that way , this section still being active will not hinder older \" dead \" sections from being archived according to your chronological archiving rules . the same argument for being moved further down your talk page also applies to this [ external link : new section ] too . talk main differences between the uefa & epl registration regulations re my proposed changes to the pst i 'm largely in favour of this , though i want to raise one point : do we actually know how often a squad can reissue it 's - man selection ? because if it 's at any time more frequently than the end of each transfer window , i 'd venture that it could prove problematic resolving how you classify a player who was included in the - man once , then was removed for a month , then was put back in , or something like that . also , while the club is waiting to sell players and has more players than the - man rule allows ( even accepting that u - s are n't counted ) how do you propose to represent the - man squad when we do n't know exactly who wo n't be included . and do we yet know what ruling the pl is using over who counts as an under - ? as i 've mentioned somewhere before , the pl has previously tended to be quite inclusive , leading to some cases of - year olds playing for under - sides for the countries and such . : i do not have the time to google a citable source for you , but i 'm pretty ( ) certain that both the epl and uefa squad registration deadlines are synchronized to the end of the summer and january transfer windows for the reasons i explained in my final paragraph of my original post ( in the \" going forward \" section below ) . with some minor differences those two transfer windows apply across almost all the uefa nations , all of which play a fall - winter - spring season , although as we keep hearing re england 's disappointing performance in the world cup last month , england ( and probably scotland too ? ) is one of the few countries that actively continues playing through its winter transfer window . i most definitely know that the deadline for the initial registering of all the epl squads for the upcoming season is august , which is indeed the same as the end of the summer transfer window . thus a club can sign its new star striker on the final day of the transfer window ( and how often have you seen that happen ? does the name robin ho ring any bells ? ) and register him to play in the epl that same day . so the short answer is , \" yes , it 's only twice a year ( citation needed ) \" ! : the example you describe of a player being initially registered in an epl squad , and then removed from it for a month , and then put back in again , etc . would indeed be a problem . it would also be an administrative nightmare ! which is why it does n't work that way . wrt \" how do you propose to represent the - man squad when we do n't know exactly who wo n't be included ? \" the answer is : exactly like [ external link : this ] . ( note : the contents of this sandbox are now completely different than what was being indicated at the time that comment was written . i 've chosen to add this later qualification here rather than modify the original text . ) talk . imo , this sandbox version of the current \" squad table \" section that gonads and i worked on ( before you came online today ) is ready to go ( meaning it could be used to overwrite the existing \" squad table \" section right now ) . as i explained in the first paragraph of the \" updating the pst \" section above , all this first update does is essentially co dify the current first team squad players into four separate pools . : there is nothing speculative or particularly contentious in adding this new column in the way that it has been set up in the sandbox . the co di fication in the new column merely represents the effective conjunction of two pieces of individually citable information that already exists for every player currently listed in your own created \" squad table \" - viz . , his current age and his junior playing ( club registration ) history prior to age . an interpretation of both the uefa and epl player registration provisions ( also externally citable , but i paraphrased them for you in steps a and b above ) is then applied to those two pieces of citable fact in order to arrive at a resultant classification for each player that is then codified with a tla . : apropos your \" the pl has previously tended to be quite inclusive , leading to some cases of - year olds playing for under - sides for the countries and such \" i quite agree . and the reason for your observation is fully explained by the \" under player provision \" i paraphrased for you in \" step a \" above . read it again very , very carefully and note well that determining january threshold . thus a young player that turned years of age this past january is considered to be \" under \" wrt the upcoming season , and he will be years and months old when it ter min ates in may . i hope that adequately addressed all your raised concerns . : i 'll give you a longer reply later but sufficed to say this : uefa has several reconfirmation periods for squads . there 's after january yes , but you also have to confirm your squad at the end of each \" tier \" of competition . by that i mean qualifying rounds , then the play - off round , then the group stages , then the knock - out rounds , and there might even be a chance to change your squad before the final too . it 's not just when there 's a transfer window that uefa make you re confirm your squad . i doubt the pl will match date for date the confirmation periods and i also doubt they will only have two , but i 'm not sure . : i hear you . when i stated above i was pretty certain that was more aimed at the epl process . i 'm pretty certain ( based on a lot of stuff i 've read , but little of it official ) that the epl registration process is only a two - step affair - once at the end of august and then again at the end of january . but even then i 'm not certain how radically within the same season these two squads can differ - viz . , can mancini register a completely different - man squad in january than he does in august ? not that even city can afford to have that many good players ( ) simply sitting around t wi ddling their thumbs until then ! i 'm assuming that \" tweaks \" of a few player sw aps ( viz . or ) are allowed to the august - man squad in the january registration of the - man squad ( in fact , i believe it is actually called a \" re - registration \" , implying the new squad for the second half of the season can not differ by too big a factor ) . also , i 'm similarly not clear on who mancini can play in august before he has to initially register his epl squad . can he play any of his players during the first two weeks of the season , or does he have to register on august any players that have already played in epl games ? : other stuff i have read had led me to believe that the epl process was essentially modeled on the uefa squad registration process that was already in place . since city were not pushing the squad limits when they played in the uefa cup two seasons ago i really did not pay much attention to this issue then , and ditto last season when the team was not competing in europe . so i am hardly a subject matter expert on the uefa squad registration requirements . here is [ external link : something ] that supports my take on the uefa situation . hardly an official text i know ( and only the first couple of posts are worth reading ) . but those posts do suggest that your understanding that the squads can or must be re - registered before every tier of the two uefa competitions is anomalous . i 'm not by any means saying you are wrong . i offer this only as gri st for the mill of this discussion . : of course , none of the above has any ramifications whatsoever on the initial co dif ying of the players in city 's first team squad into four pools of player eligibility ( which i believe to be information that is much more pertinent to any given player 's ability to clock up statistics in the upcoming season than , for instance , displaying the flag of that player 's nationality ) . the issue of squad registration frequency only affects whether it would be wise to try and go beyond my basic classification of the players into pools , and further indicate in the pst the actual named squads once they have both been submitted , or whether doing so would only be an open invitation to edit warring due to how often the makeup of these squads changed during the course of the season . even only changing twice ( every august and january ) might still be too frequent from that perspective . : i 've spent quite some time since my last post above trying to find the official text of the squad registration requirements on the official web sites of both uefa and the premier league with absolutely no luck . one would think both of those sites would have a section dedicated to it prominently displayed . or at least a faq section dedicated to the topic . and they may well do , but i 've not been able to locate it yet on either site . after i came across that manchester united message board web page and the comment there that was quoting text from uefa . com site i similarly spent quite a bit of time trying to locate a source version of that text , also with no luck . which is why i posted the link to the united mb discussion because it is still the best coverage of this topic that i could come up with . however , i 'm not at all happy with it because it is not a primary source and technically it is merely hearsay ( which , of course , is how most people are learning about the ramifications of the new ruling ) . it was only because that one poster seemed to be quoting the official text of the ruling from the uefa . com web site that i used it above . i 'll still keep looking for a better source of information . it mt , if you know of a link to the source text of either of the epl and uefa squad registration rulings please post them here so that we can base any discussion of this issue going forward on the actual rulings rather than on gossipy ( mis - ) interpretations of them . thanks . : wrt the uefa squad registration rulings re its three club competitions this is now a closed issue . i have located all of them for the current - season and the \" player eligibility \" text in each of them is essentially identical . talk : btw , i am assuming that the same uefa squad registration requirements apply to all three of its competitions and that there is not a separate one for each of the champions league , the europa league and the super cup ! please lord , let that be the case ! ( : see my response comments re this topic in the previous section and the one directly above . this is no longer an assumption on my behalf ; having read the three pertinent documents i now know for sure that it is true . this is a non - issue . non - issue closed . you can now delete both this and the previous italicized paragraph if you care to . talk : you are most probably right that you ca n't register an entirely new squad of after the january transfer window , but it only requires one player to be an exceptional case and good planning and negotiation such as this can go out of the window , of course . but yeah , you 're right . i do n't know why i did n't bother looking for the rules of the competitions in question , but i took a gander myself and found [ external link : the uefa regulations for the - europa league ] and [ external link : this page ] of links for the handbook for the premier league this season . while the europa league rules appear to back you up and stick closely to the champions league rules in that thread of the un mention able team that you cited , the pl seems f ru str atingly vague about the whole thing , but maybe i just have n't found the right section yet . at any rate , as a by - product of this whole thing , i have been able to confirm that the rd strip is officially white all over ( bar the s ash on the kit and socks ) and not white - and - black , and we do indeed appear to be using the green goalkeepers kit again , which it was my mistake to dismiss earlier . also i now know some extra board of director names to stick on the [ wiki link : man city ] article , but whatever . at any rate , it seems that you 're probably right about the restrictions in re - registration . i believe the rule about games up to the end of august is that you have to register every player who plays ( i . e . when they sign ) , but you can re - register a squad as many times as you need before the st of september deadline , by the way - the nature of evolving transfers makes that necessary . obviously , after the transfer window is closed it then becomes final . : one thing that came to mind while skimming over those regulations pdfs , however , was the notion that the uefa competitions have somewhat different squad statuses for players than the pl does . for instance , the two governing bodies disagree over the definition of \" home - grown \" . uefa insists it goes by nationality iirc , the pl does n't . also , uefa wo n't let you include unlimited u - s whereas the pl will , etc . will your table include a second list of squad status abbreviations to cover this or do you intend to find a way of merging the two together somehow ? : this is a response to your last paragraph above only . apropos your , \" uefa insists it goes by nationality iirc , the pl does n't , \" that 's not true - see my new column in the table in the phase sandbox ( also see my comments in the section up above , which btw i 'm assuming you 've read before you started reading this - but i probably should n't assume that ! ) . : the reason for my stating that your iirc comment is not true is explained in my \" rule \" comments below . i believe you are were confusing proposed fifa and existing uefa regulations when you wrote that . talk : apropos your , \" uefa wo n't let you include unlimited u - s whereas the pl will , \" that 's also not true - uefa specifically states that an unlimited number of u players can be re gi ster d via list b . wrt your last sentence asking about what my strategy for all of this is , see all my response text up above in the previous section . finally , take a look at the age definition of what constitutes an u player ( list b player ) in that europa league pdf and compare the defining cutoff date to what i 've defined it to be in in the epl section of my sandbox ( either sandbox will do currently ) . do you think they are equivalent ? i 'm not going to tell you what i think until i hear your opinion . talk : they are n't the same . the uefa rules have that thing about needing to be eligible for the club for two years since your th birthday - the wording is n't good but it suggests they 've got to have been on the club 's books for a while to count as an under - . it also suggests that an under - would have to register as an over - in order to play because of that ruling too . : i 'm afraid i missed that subtlety . but i think it 's exactly the same vaguely - worded paragraph that we are both trying to de construct the true intended meaning out of here . just so we are both singing from the same sheet i 'll quote it directly below . : \" . a player may be registered on list b if he is born on or after january and has been eligible to play for the club concerned for any uninterrupted period of two years since his th birthday by the time he is registered with uefa . players aged may be registered on list b if they have been registered with the participating club for the previous two years without interruption . \" : what caught my attention was that \" january \" cutoff date , which is what was behind my above question . that would make list b players \" under \" players rather than \" under \" as com par ably defined for the epl , which even then means that year - olds can be validly playing in the second half of the season ( after january ) as i indicated to you up above in my first response in this section . however , as you point out , that \" year prior registration with the same club requirement \" does make the uefa requirement somewhat different ( viz . more restrictive ) than the comparable epl requirement as i understand it ( without the comparable source pdf text put out by the epl ) . although i stated yesterday in a section above that i did not believe we needed more than the current status codes , that was written before i started my analysis of the above quoted paragraph which was pretty late last night ( my time ) and i was very tired . but i suspected i needed a new \" u \" code or something ( for that uefa situation ) if my initial take of that date was correct , so i decided to throw out the question to you and get your opinion of that date threshold and get some sleep and think about it again today with a fresh mind . : the other implications of that text were lost on my sleepy brain last night , but i now agree with you . there at least implications buried in that . paragraph that make that uefa list b \" youth player \" requirement quite different from the epl \" u \" requirement as i have it currently defined . but we only need one difference between the two youth player provisions in order to require a new th status code - which we now do . the pst section of your season article is not the place for us to define the mundane nic eties of the various provisions as stipulated by uefa and the epl ( or is it the english and or welsh fas ? i ask that aside here because these players have to be registered with the english or welsh fas , not the epl , in order to be accepted as being registered with uefa ) . all we need to understand is that there is a difference between the two sti pu lations ( thus requiring codes not ) and which code sub sum es the other one , so that i can stipulate - as i think is the case here - that any player satisfying the uefa \" youth \" provision automatically satisfies the epl one ( in the same manner that all uefa \" acg \" players , as i have them currently defined , also satisfy the epl \" hgp \" provision ) . the difference in detail , and which provision ( and thus which squad status code ) sub sum es the other , is all that matters to us , not every jot and tittle of those differences in detail . : so the up shot of all this is that i need to add a new code to the squad status code definition table in the phase sandbox ( just that one for now ) , which is what i believed i would have to do before i went to bed last night ( actually it was late early morning for me ) and threw out that question at you to focus your attention on that text ( which is clearly what you had been focused on when you had written your last paragraph above ) . just for the record , my take on the two differences between the uefa and epl \" youth or junior player \" provisions that must be met for list b player registration ( for uefa ; i have no idea what the epl call it ) is as follows : * youth player maximum age provision \" under \" ( for epl ) but \" under \" ( for uefa ) - or , however you want to express it , the two maximum age thresholds for determining whether a player is a senior player or not differ by one year . : the above apparent difference bet wen the epl and uefa maximum age thresholds for youth players is actually not an issue . it was caused because i had n't noticed that you had you linked me above to last season 's europa league regulations rather than to this upcoming season 's ( because even though i saw \" - \" designation on both the document front page and in your link , the being in there made it register in my mind that it was the most current one , which of course should contain \" - so my bad ) . thus the \" date in the text of last season 's regulations that i was questioning and asked you to take a look at is correctly updated to \" in all three of the new uefa competitions regulations for the upcoming - season . which is right in line with the comparable epl date . : so both epl and uefa define \" under \" in exactly the same way . therefore non - issue closed and you can delete the above bullet plus all this italicized text if you care to . considering that the europa league document you linked me to was hosted on an ukranian server i guess i should just be grateful that what you sent me was written in english - because all the language of all the displayed text on the uefa web site it is hosted on is ukranian ! ( talk : * a youth player satisfying the above epl maximum age provision ( e . g . , mario bal o tel li ) could theoretically play with \" youth \" status in an epl game for a club such as city within two hours of being transferred in and registered by that club with the epl ; while even though that same player satisfied the comparable maximum age provision set by uefa , he would have to be registered on the books of his new club for a further years before he was eligible to be registered ( via list b ) to play with \" youth \" status in an uefa competition game . : btw , i took you at your word on the matter of it being possible for a player to be registered for any epl game up to about an hour before kick off and incorporated that concept more vaguely worded ( viz . \" a short time before \" ) into my latest round of text updates in the phase sandbox . however , it was mentioned more than once in the commentary of the spurs - city match yesterday that bal o tel li could not play in that game because he was transferred too late to be eligible for it . his transfer was completed sometime friday because the web article announcing he was now a city player appeared on the mcfc web site friday afternoon and the club never publicly make such transfer announcements until it is a done deal . so by my reckoning city had about hours ( give or take ) to list b register him for the spurs game if it had wanted to . i suspect city did n't register him for other reasons ( e . g . , because mancini first wants to work with him in training before fielding him ; no shirts made for him yet ; etc . ) rather than that the club could n't register him to play even if they had wanted to . however , i throw this thought out just to make you reconsider your source for that comment . i intend to leave what i have written re the deadlines for epl list b registration as it currently stands unless i have something more correct to replace it with ( if it is indeed wrong ) . : talk : * a youth player satisfying the above epl maximum age provision ( e . g . , a year old wayne rooney at everton ) could play in an epl game without being a registered member of the - man epl squad ; while even though that same player satisfied the comparable maximum age provision set by uefa , in order for him to be eligible to play in an uefa competition game he would have to be registered in the - man uefa squad via one of the \" free player \" slots on list a ( because he fails to meet the years months minimum threshold for registration with his owning club in order to qualify to be registered in one of the \" acg \" or \" hgp \" list a slots , in addition to failing to meet the \" uninterrupted two years \" minimum threshold for registration with his owning club in order to qualify as a player eligible to be registered with uefa via list b ) . : please confirm asap that the above is your understanding too , or alternatively give me your interpretation of this stupid piece of \" legal verbiage \" . it mt , i will go add and document the new \" youth \" squad status code in the definition table that summarizes my four existing squad status codes . fyi , i 'm not going to update any inline text above that table until we are both happy with the table contents . then , and only then , will i go back and modify the above inline text to make it expound upon and be more consistent with the contents of the table . also , when you respond back here , give me your feedback on how you feel about my essentially handling all of the subtle distinctions between the uefa and epl - man squad provisions in the two new columns i 've introduced . : finally , wrt your other comment in your final paragraph above - viz . \" . the two governing bodies disagree over the definition of ' home - grown ' . uefa insists it goes by nationality iirc , the pl does n't . \" - i believe my distinction between \" hgp \" and \" acg \" captured that disagreement . or did you have something else in mind that i have missed ? let me know asap if you did . talk : we 're in agreement . and yeah , you actually did capture that disagreement , my bad . also to clarify a few other minor points you raised in this section , they are pl rules not fa rules - the fa itself has no such rules on any competition like this , only ine li gi bilities along the lines of players being cup - tied , so in fact city could win the fa cup never playing any player more than once and still satisfy fa conditions . : just as a clarification here ( i do n't expect you to respond to this point unless you disagree with what follows ; in which case please correct me ) . the reason for my original aside was because the premier league is a subsidiary ( for lack of a better term ) of the f . a . - that 's why it is called the f . a . premier league ! also , all professional players have to be validly registered with their local f . a . ( meaning english or welsh ) in order to play professionally anywhere within england or wales ( as appropriate ) . to my mind , that registration serves as their equivalent of an actor 's equity card . that is also why the premier league does not need a list b registration form for the youth players . those players must be registered with their local f . a . anyway in order to play period . and as yourself have pointed out , that registration can be approved ( not submitted ) up to an hour before a game 's kick - off . talk : my original point about uefa and the pl differing on their definitions of home - grown players was incorrect by the way . i ca n't remember the exact rule uefa had , but it used to have a rule saying you had to name a number of player specifically of the nationality of the club they represented . clearly this is gone now . of course , you identified slight , more subtle differences which remain and they should not be ignored , but that was the origin of my claim , for the record . i thought at first that rule was part of the home - grown player restriction , but thinking back i do n't think it ever was . but whatever . that rule is clearly not present now . and yes , you 're right about players playing under - to the age of , but then as i said , uefa has always been increasingly lenient and it 's easier and easier to play youth football into your early s these days . both uefa and the pl use the term \" list b \" for youths , incidentally . it 's becoming increasingly clear to me as i read into this that there 's obviously been a great deal of co - operation in rolling out these rules so i guess we should expect to see something similar in spain and italy soon , and then the rest of europe will follow . oh , and one last , very minor point : pl and fa rules actually state that a player only needs one hour of registration time to be used in a match - day squad , not hours . in practice , though , i ca n't remember any time a player managed to play in a game on the same day they signed - usually the medical is too exhausting to allow it . : i do so much prefer being in violent agreement with someone than being in violent disagreement with them ! ) i just made some slight textual changes additions to my previous post above ( indicated in bold ) to better reflect some of your comments and or word smith it to be more accurate , having now had the luxury of being able to reread what i posted to you earlier ! i do n't think you 'll disagree with them but if you do be sure to tell me . i wanted to keep the text as accurate as possible because i have a sneaky feeling that some part of it is going to end up in the article , and these sort of inter changes are imo often the best means of scrubbing such text to a better level of accuracy than one can generate just by oneself , no matter how definitive and objective one tries to be . : apropos your reference to the uefa rule that you can not quite remember that addressed the nationality of the players in a team , i think you might be thinking of a potential fifa mandate ( which uefa and then , in turn , the various national fas ) would have to align itself with , that is commonly referred to as the \" rule \" . there is even a wikipedia [ external link : article ] about it ( i just now discovered that by accident while googling \" rule \" to make sure i had the term correct ) . i have never read the text of it , but i believe that with it fifa had adopted an agenda of encouraging ( co er cing ? ) the top clubs around the world to better develop and utilize their own national talent - rather than just importing it from other countries ( particularly the african and asian ones where the game is still developing ) in the manner that many are now accusing city of doing , but which clubs such as barcelona , real madrid and the two milan clubs have been doing in like manner for over half a century now - by sti pu l ating the actual national makeup of a fielded team . : fifa was intending to mandate that its various constituent confederations must , by some future date , enforce that all the clubs under their jurisdiction would only be able to field a team containing a minimum of national players ( meaning players eligible to be selected for the national team of the country in which the club was located ) in all competitions under their governance . this agenda was quietly dropped by fifa in june while the world cup was on . i believe it was meeting very strong legal and political resistance worldwide with both countries and clubs claiming that fifa 's policy was clearly pro tec tionist and that it violated the \" free movement \" provisions in many countries ' labor laws , particularly the bos man ruling as it pertains to eu labor laws that specifically mandate the free movement of labor between all member countries of the eu . so rather than take on the political might of brussels it looks like fifa finally backed off from that strategy , and did so while everyone 's attention was on south africa so that few people , if any , would notice how much egg it had on its chin . : most people viewed fifa 's \" rule \" as simply the natural continuation of uefa 's already implemented \" homegrown player \" policy , particularly since it starts its life off as a \" rule \" ( where that \" seems to map directly to the \" acg \" slots already stipulated by uefa for squads , rather than match day team sheets ) and then transitions over a period of years via \" \" to the ultimate goal of \" \" . additionally , it is uefa that would have had to implement and enforce this new policy across the whole of europe if the \" rule \" had been ratified by all the member confederations of fifa . so imo it is quite natural to get it mixed up with everything else we have been discussing here . anyways , if the \" rule \" is n't what you were thinking of , then i hope that at least you found the foregoing informative . : finally , wrt your comment , \" it 's becoming increasingly clear to me as i read into this that there 's obviously been a great deal of co - operation in rolling out these rules . \" it is my observation , having now analyzed the details of the two main areas where the epl and uefa regulations actually differ , that far from \" cooperating \" with the intent and spirit of the uefa policy , the epl has carefully removed from its registration requirements whatever teeth the uefa ones actually has . to my mind , the epl 's actions wrt the uefa policy is the same subtle difference as being \" polite \" and \" grin - fucking \" someone . ) finally , now all you need to do is perform some \" garbage collection \" in the next section so that we can both start to see the woods for the trees again ! ( : talk : i will just add one final comment here before you archive this section . in observing above that the epl have only followed the letter of the existing uefa player registration regulations rather than the spirit of them , one can come to one of two possible conclusions . the first is that the epl 's lip - service is simply one big cynical fu aimed towards uefa wrt this issue ; the other is that with the new \" tooth less \" player registration regulations going into effect this year the epl is instead doing no more than getting the infrastructure in place so that the individual \" teeth \" can then be in c re mentally added in future seasons . if this is indeed the case , and knowing the likes of richard scu dam ore and co . i strongly suspect it is , then we will very likely see in future seasons a mandate that a number of the ( currently ) hgp designated players in a squad must also be academy trained too ( viz . now ag p ) ; and similarly , a length of tenure might well be added to the \" youth player \" provision bringing the current u designation much more in line with the existing uefa yth designation . : one thing the premier league must be careful about doing is getting too far ahead of its major rival uefa leagues in spain , italy and germany , etc . wrt the stance it takes on player registration . if it gets too severe too quickly such that the current net migration of good foreign players and managers into the epl dries up and reverses direction , such that all those players and managers start going to those other major leagues instead , then the epl will quickly relinquish its status as the world 's best football league that scu dam ore and co . have worked so hard over the last decade or so to make it , and that can not be good for anyone that is invested in the success of the english game . talk * status of this section : i think that most of the points that were raised and discussed in this section have been resolved here , and that this fairly lengthy section probably should now be archived as - is . i have removed all the bolding that was still in this section 's text prior to my edit to add this status because that bolding was pretty much added to make sure you saw all my updated comments in a timely manner ( and did not miss any ) at the time that they were made . additionally , there is some quite useful information in this section ( imho ) . if only all of our sections would turn out like this one ! ( : having just stated that \" most of the points \" were resolved here , unfortunately the one point that was not resolved was the issue of the implications of the required frequency of re - registration of the uefa squads which this section was specifically started ( by me ) to handle . we allowed this section to wander off onto many other ( important and interesting ) topics , all of which now appear to be resolved except for the main important one ! consequently , i have re - titled this section to better reflect its actual content and focus , and i will create a new one directly below it ( in order to handle the topic this one somehow left behind ) as soon as i 've saved the edit that adds this status . : talk squad re - registration issues - handling of this in the new pst \" eli g . \" columns to summarize this issue from all that has been written previously on this topic in other sections here . * the premier league allows for two registrations of an epl - man squad during the course of a season - the first initial squad registration occurs at the end of the summer ( pre - season ) transfer window , and the second squad re - registration occurs at the end of the winter january transfer window . for the periods in between those two transfer - cum - registration windows the squads are essentially frozen ( goalkeeper emergency and possibly other special situations aside ) ; * in comparison , uefa allow for multiple registrations of an uefa - man squad during the course of a season ( the details of which i 'll discuss below rather than summarize here like i just did for the premier league situation above ) . the two - times - per - season registration process ( summarized above ) does not seem to present too much \" churn \" for our representing it in the pst - currently in the \" eli g . \" sub - column of the premier league competition column . the concern initially expressed by you ( and concurred with by me ) was that the multiple uefa squad registrations might indeed represent too much churn for the pst to sensibly track in the comparable \" eli g . \" sub - column of the uefa europa league competition column . however , this also turns out to be pretty much a non - issue as i 'll now explain below . the multiple squad re - registrations required for both the uefa champions league and europa league competitions are essentially all for the early qualifying and play - off rounds . below are the multiple squad ( re - ) registration deadlines for this season ( - ) for both of those uefa competitions ( the text shown being directly quoted from . of the respective \" rules and regulations \" documents issued by uefa for each of those competitions ) . * champions league : list a has to be submitted by the following fixed deadlines : a ) june ( . cet ) for all matches in the first qualifying round ; : b ) july ( . cet ) for all matches in the second qualifying round ; : c ) july ( . cet ) for all matches in the third qualifying round ; : d ) august ( . cet ) for all matches in the play - offs ; : e ) september ( . cet ) for all further matches from the first match in the group stage up to and including the final . * europa league : list a has to be submitted by the following fixed deadlines : a ) june ( . cet ) for all matches in the first qualifying round ; : b ) july ( . cet ) for all matches in the second qualifying round ; : c ) july ( . cet ) for all matches in the third qualifying round ; : d ) august ( . cet ) for all matches in the play - off round ; : e ) st september ( . cet ) for all further matches from the first match in the group stage up to and including the final . as you can see from the above , the wording , deadline dates , and the rounds they apply to in each case are essentially the same for the two competitions , and all of those list a registration deadlines apply within the summer transfer window . in that sense , the uefa squad registration process represents even less churn than the premier league one does , because once each of those competitions are fully under way ( with the start of the respective group stages ) the squads can not even be re - adjusted as a result of transfer and loan transactions done during the winter transfer windows . note also that only deadline ( e ) applies to the top three epl clubs entering the champions league ; only deadlines ( d ) and ( e ) apply to the fourth ( lowest placed ) epl club entering the champions league and the top two ranked epl clubs entering the europa league ; while only deadlines ( c ) , ( d ) and ( e ) apply to the third ( lowest ranked ) epl club entering the europa league . if we just treat the epl and uefa squads as being in a \" state of flux \" during the last month of the summer transfer window ( viz . august ) then both of these squads can be formally nailed down come september ( viz . next wednesday ) with only the epl squad needing a possible read just ment come the end of january . your comments on the foregoing please . talk : when i first wrote my main post in [ external link : this section ] one of the big concerns i had about introducing my two \" eli g . \" columns into the pst was whether they would be the source of too much churn and edit - wars type disagreements . those concerns were triggered mostly by your own comments that the uefa cl and el competitions required that - man squads be re - registered with uefa at every tier ( round ) of those competitions . remember that when i wrote my main post in that section i had not yet seen any of the source \" rules and regulations \" documents for the uefa competitions and i was merely trying to give due weight to your own voiced concerns . of course , since then , i have read all of the various r & r ; documents for those competitions and the above post is my assessment of that initial issue of potentially too much churn . in short , i do n't think it is a problem at all . do you agree ? : i 'm not going to declare this issue closed yet . the need for multiple re - registration of the uefa squads during the early qualifying rounds that are played bang in the middle of the july and august summer transfer window might yet come back to bite us in other ways . but for right now , it appears to me to not be a significant issue . which means that one of my two main concerns when i wrote that post in the other section has been resolved ( at least for the time being ) . let 's keep this section open in case any other issues relating to the need for squad re - registration ( s ) subsequently occurs to either of us ; but for right now , i do n't see this as a problem and i want us to focus on other more important issues . do you concur ? talk strawman pst re the handling of mancini 's actual registered - man squads here 's a [ external link : strawman pst ] for how we might handle , come august , mancini 's submitted squad assignments for the epl and europa league competitions . note that the \" acg \" status players s re simply enumerated as \" hgp \" players for the epl squad because there is no \" acg \" requirement for the epl . both of the - man squads in my example pst utilize \" for \" players and \" hgp \" players , with the uefa squad specifically identifying which four of the \" hgp \" players satisfy the \" acg \" requirement ( thus the squad makeup is - ) . all the u players are currently shown as being in both squads as they can play in any competition - but because of that it might be better style to just leave their fields blank ( on the basis that there also a lot of eds players not listed in the pst , such as ben mee , that could play too ) . also , to make the squad colum s a little thinner it might be a better idea to use just the first letter of the tla codes in these columns . thus the epl squad players would be identified h - h and f - f , and the uefa squad players a - a , h - h , and f - f . the two squads show given and taylor being utilized as the goalkeepers in the epl squad , with hart and taylor as the two goalkeepers in the uefa squad . in reality , mancini will probably use three goalkeepers in both squads ( but maybe not ) . j is only used as a striker in the uefa squad while ca ice do takes his slot in the epl squad . i did a similar squad split for on u oha and michael johnson . anyway , you get the idea . : i also view this [ external link : latest sandbox ] update as just speculative experimentation as to how we might possibly encode actual registered squads should we determine that they will not be a source of major edit wars down the pike . it is entirely possible that we might still not choose to go so far as doing that . however , i view what we have here in our [ external link : first sandbox ] as pretty much ready to go ( meaning i would be happy doing that update edit to the article right now ) . it probably needs the text you are requesting below adding in first ( and i 'm currently thinking about the best way to do that ) but in terms of the co di fication accuracy and general layout , etc . i think it is good to go right now ( while how we actually represent the registered squads probably still needs quite a bit more scrubbing back and forth between us ) . oh , i would also like a second opinion on shay given 's status from you before we publish ( and be damned ! ) . i 'm quite happy to preserve archive text that is well written and has possible future use as an useful record of and reference to what transpired in reaching a local concurrence between us wrt possible changes to be made to the pst , but i think that text along the lines of . comment : \" i think that word should be hyphenated . \" response : \" yes , i agree and i 've now fixed it . \" . might be approaching the level of being way too anal . i refer to such text about other dialogue text as meta - text . once we know we 've communicated the thought to the other person such meta - text can imo simply be deleted . ditto original dialogue text where the author of it now wishes to retract what he previously wrote and tells the other person \" never mind \" ( that would be another example of meta - text ) . to my way of thinking , if you do n't separate such meta - text from the regular point - counterpoint discourse text , but keep all that inter ming led meta - text in place as well , you are going to drive both of us crazy . sending the other person some meta - text suggesting that they manipulate the source text in some way if they are in concurrence with the suggestion is really no different than , say , editing your own post just after you 've made it ( to remove silly typos , etc . ) . the meta - text approach simply involves the other person in the edit loop so that he is party to it and so is fully conversant with the way the source text ultimately gets manipulated ( because he is the person that ultimately does the edit because he agreed with it ) . such a process works perfectly fine in a - way conversation such as the one we 're having . i have been using the convention in our various dialogues here of indicating text that i think is now irrelevant or redundant , etc . ( and can therefore be removed by mutual consent ) by ital ici zing it , and posting my meta - text opinion of what i think should ultimately be done with that target text separately in bold font . if you disagree with my suggestion and wish instead to preserve some text rather than delete it , then all you have to do is norm alize ( un - italicize ) it again , and perhaps give a reason why ( but even that is not necessary ) . either way , whether you reject the suggested edit ( such as deletion ) or go ahead and do the suggested edit because you concur with it , you really need to delete the meta - text ( because that becomes old news whatever the outcome ) . your preserving of the meta - text in place in addition to the chunks of source text i already feel are redundant is driving me bon kers because it is simply compounding the mess i 'm trying to get you to clear up by asking you to delete that text in the first place ! my initial attempt at establishing this protocol of using meta - text to keep the source discourse text relevant and concise was , i decided , a little too cumbersome . i subsequently realized that the process of my first suggesting to you that a chunk of text should be removed because it was now wrong or redundant and asking you to concur before i then did the delete myself involved one too many steps . all i really needed to do was make the suggestion and you could show your concurrence by simply doing the delete ( or some other type of edit that i suggested ) yourself . this protocol , of course , works both ways . and no text ever gets deleted or modified using this approach without both parties ( viz . the \" su g ge stor \" and the \" edit executor \" ) agreeing to it . i just wanted this to be a background \" clutter and garbage removal \" process , and not a means for one of us to achieve the other 's concurrence over something by twisting his arm with threats of deletion or anything - besides , you can not delete anything on wikipedia because there is a record history of all edits performed . btw , i regard all of the various section stat i i wrote for you to be meta - text . it informed you how i felt about the rest of the source discourse text in that section ; whether i considered all the issues raised in that text to all be either resolved or now moot ( and thus the section could be archived ) or whether i considered the issue ( s ) being discussed in that section text to still be open ongoing . you need n't bother to preserve that text as far as i 'm concerned . you just need to read it and act upon it ( and that includes , say , not archiving something i suggested could be archived because you felt there were still open issues involved from your end ) . you clearly recognize the meta - text nature of my section stat i comments because you are now putting it in \" small font \" . your \" small font \" simply equates to my \" bold font \" . if you would like us to adopt a convention of using only \" small font \" for what i 'm calling meta - text that would be preferable to me too . but the bottom line is , meta - text needs to be deleted once read and acted upon by the recipient ( such action including giving a reason why he refused to act upon it ! ) . does all of the foregoing make sense ? * i just replaced the paragraphs that used to be here by the ones above . they represent what i should have written when i wrote my original paragraphs if i only had more time to better word smith them when i originally posted them . note that this small font comment is a meta - text comment and it can be deleted as soon as you have read it . talk : - : i went ahead and moved all the text that was here to its own new section immediately below this one . it mt i consider what 's left of this section to be somewhat of a construction site . beware , men at work ! i will return later and try to tidy it up some more when i get the time . it mt , i believe i have a spare hard hat if you need one . ) talk : - : i have gone ahead and tidied up this section by deleting all the text that i have been waiting for you to delete thereby showing your concurrence with my recommendation that it should be removed because it was now all \" old news \" . i did the deletes in self - contained and easy to follow edit chunks identified as \" text ti dy up \" through \" text ti dy up \" . if you feel that any of those deletions need restoring then go ahead and revert the deletions , but i think you 'll find that everything i removed only pertains to closed , moot or non - issues . i would have also deleted the above two ( now italicized ) paragraphs too but i needed something on which to hang this current response post . i see that the latest bout of announced loan out activity during the last few days caused clayton to be removed again from the main mcfc article which now correctly shows only players lo aned out - on u oha , bellamy , weiss and nielsen ( and even he 's questionable ! ) . so that is now a closed issue and you can delete this paragraph along with the two above it if you agree . let 's try and focus on getting closure on everything rather than acc um ulating as much text ( and thus potential open issues ) as possible ! ( talk : i 'll revert it when i archive it , but not here . i like having a record of everything that is said so i will restore it for personal use , but there 's no need for it to be seen here anymore . thanks anyway . * status of this section : i officially declare this section to be \" wikipedia ground zero \" ! : i considered most of what was in this section to be old news back on aug before the new pst roll out - hence my \" ti dy up \" deletes . post pst roll out it is most definitely so . as for the text that still remains in this section here is my assessment of it . ( ) i have captured the essence of the first paragraph over [ external link : here ] in my pst enhancement proposal fun c . spec . document ( for lack of a better name ) where it will be preserved , so the text can be simply deleted from here . ( ) the second paragraph refers to explains my two hypothetical epl and uefa squads that i initially set up in my sandbox pst . this is very old news now as the pst currently in the actual season article contains ( a ) the exact current uefa squad which mancini will be tweaking ( viz . milner will be added and someone needs to be removed to make way for him , presumably robin ho if he is sold in time ) and re - registering in the next couple of days ; and ( b ) a very close approximation to his current interim epl squad ( which mancini will also have to tweak and fin alize in the next couple of days too ) . so this text can also be deleted . ( ) the third indented paragraph refers to my initial intended phasing of the pst roll outs which is now a moot issue too , and so this text can also be deleted as far as i am concerned . : finally , the remainder of the text in this section is actually meta - text that addresses what was done with , or how to handle going forward , various portions of all the other text . as long as you 've read it and com pre hen ded it then this text too can also be deleted , which means that as far as i 'm concerned this section is no more . it is a dead parrot . it is deceased . and the only reason that i 'm having to write this message , due to there still being some text left in this section , is mostly because you have insisted on nai ling it to the perch ! ( : as far as i 'm concerned , our time on this planet is already too brief as it is , so i 'll leave you to work out how to remove this section given your own rigorous chronological archiving rules . btw , if you feel there was something addressed in this section that is still an unresolved issue then please bring it to my attention . : talk squad status breakdown for the manchester city first team squad also it was seem convenient , interesting and encyclopedic to perhaps provide a small summary of the amount of players satisfying each condition perhaps ? i . e . \" the squad for this season contains : foreign players ; academy graduates ; home - grown players ; under - s \" ( yes i made those figures up ) . in this example you could fe asi bly allow players to be double - counted - that is to say , if they are home - grown and an academy graduate you could count them for both statistics ( or not , if you disagree ) which would make an explanation that ' certain statuses super cede other statuses but do not remove them entirely ' more necessary and yet more understandable , perhaps . : wrt your \" yes i made those figures up \" comment above , after seeing the arguments you 've presented to me re the \" vu oso issue \" i 'm tempted to reply to you , \" that 's ok , you appear to enjoy making the squad up every season too , so why stop there ? ! \" ) : seriously though , i can not write such a section until i know what the official mcfc first team squad for this upcoming season is ( and i do n't mean the uefa and epl registered squads ; i mean the \" first team squad \" pool from which those squads will in turn be selected ) . so i wo n't be in a position to write that section as long as you and i have to wave our arms about and admit that determining the mcfc first team squad is \" more art than science \" . another of the reasons i can not write anything is because somebody called p wi mag eg low edited the main mcfc article on aug in order to put adam clayton out on loan when he was n't even showing as being in the first team squad in the first place . presumably it was clayton 's lack of inclusion in the first team squad in that article that caused you to agree with my reasoning [ external link : here ] to remove him from the pst a week earlier . : so what i want to know is where were the nigel de jong styled editors to revert that un ci table edit when we really needed them ? as i say , you guys continually come across as a cl u ster fuck that spends almost all its time trying to nail jello to the wall and justifying your edit and reversion decisions by shooting from the hip . i 'm not going to spend my precious time writing something ( such as you suggested above ) only to have it immediately reverted as being inconsistent with the main mcfc article and not citing a source ( because there is no way i could cite support for adam clayton either being in the first team squad or not ) . to even attempt to that would be a lose - lose situation for me . and knowing my luck , i would probably get hit with another admin . warning to boot ! as the expression goes . once bitten , twice shy . : the above paragraph was probably written mostly in frustration at seeing someone put clayton out on loan over in the main mcfc article without first checking to see if he was even a first team squad member . this frustration was then compounded when gonads added a citation to support that person 's num b sk ul l ery ! ( you can go ahead and delete the above italicized paragraph plus this one , but only after you first remove clayton ( period ) from the first team squad over in the main article ) . : talk : take a look at this [ external link : new section and table ] that i 've added into my sandbox . does this achieve the \" small summary \" that you were requesting above ? note well that i synchronized the numbers in that table with the latest version of the dreaded mcfc website \" players \" tab which currently lists first team squad players . all lo aned out players are listed there which accounts for of the players that currently do not get listed in the new version of the pst that you rolled out yesterday ( which only has entries ) . two of the other players are the ones that some num b skull has already tried to add back in to the new pst and i reverted ( viz . vidal and gonz lez ) while third one is kelvin e tu hu . if you like the new table i 'll go ahead and adjust the numbers to ignore those players so that it is consistent with the current pst , and then you can roll it out too ( or you can just go ahead and do that adjustment yourself before rolling it out ) . hmmm , i just remembered that e tu hu has made something like appearance for the first team ( just not any time recently ) , so perhaps he should be added back into the pst , and the first team squad count ( excluding lo aned - out players ) now becomes . let me know which pieces of jello you would like to see nailed to the wall ! ( : talk : fyi , the method by which i keep track of who belongs in my pst and who is officially in the first team squad this week and reconcile all the differences is [ external link : here ] . as you can determine from my update log i continue to keep the list of players synchronized with the mcfc website squad listing and all of the transfer and loan news reported there too . there are players on my list and the that appear in the pst are only those with digits appended to their squad status codes . i am assuming that you check in on this document on a regular basis ( which is why i have been fairly anal about signing time stamping all my updates to it so you can follow them ) . if you have n't been checking it regularly then going forward you might want to start doing so at least every or days . if nothing else that will allow me to remove old signatures and or log entries once the text has st abi li zed or the changes are now ancient history . although it originally started life as a posted suggestion proposal to you on your talk page , i now consider this \" document \" to be a sort of mini functional spec . for all the changes that i have recommended and or have already implemented . please let me know that you understand what i 'm try ting to do here . : talk : nice work , and i certainly will follow it . if you want to make the edits to that table i will add the table to the article tomorrow morning , just before i go on holiday . if you look at the article , i made your little codes analysis fully collapsible so that by default it barely takes up any space at all - hope you approve . for now i think the references to pl and uefa provisions can be left to refer to the cited sources , so i 'm happy to leave it there but when i return from holiday next week i will work on a more ready solution - if you have any ideas in the meantime feel free to tinker and we can discuss the situation when i get back . you 've been full of good ideas so far - and your efforts have put mine to shame , i can honestly say - so i suspect that you will quite probably come up with a much better solution than i will in the same amount of time . i 'll ponder it while i 'm away though , and see what i come up with . : ok , i reworked that table and now it is good to go . the above \" new section and table \" link ( three paragraphs above ) still links to it despite the fact that i 've moved that section in my sandbox document . in fact i 've moved quite a few sections around so that my sandbox document is better synchronized to what you rolled out in the article . i really liked what you did in making my table collapsible and placing it after the pst as a sort of legend definition for the pst - which is actually what it started life as ! however , please note that i had a lot of problems with getting that table to collapse which are documented [ external link : here ] . i believe i have now fixed it . it now works for me in ie ; hopefully i have n't broken it for everybody else ! i think the problem was caused by your not giving the table a name ( not even a null name ) - presumably so that all that would show up on the user 's screen would be \" show \" . you can see from that dialogue with gonads what each of us saw . once i gave the hidden table a name it began to work for me , although it was clearly working for gonads the way you originally had it . : anyway , besides the fact that this is the only way that the collapsible table will work for me ( and presumably for lots of other users too ) , i think i actually prefer the little tab displaying \" squad status ( show ) \" being there rather than just the word \" show \" all by itself . the reason i prefer it is that all of the encoding in the \" registered squad \" columns ( labeled \" reg . \" in the pst ) still has yet to be defined too , and i think i want that definition to be handled in a similar manner - viz . by a collapsible table accessed by a tab labeled \" reg . ( show ) \" . this table will , of course , be much smaller and less complicated than the current one and , since you introduced a double column under the pst so that the rs citations could be displayed side by side , it might actually be possible to place the \" reg . \" table tab in the right hand column alongside the other collapsible tab . if not , the new tab will just have to sit underneath the existing \" squad status \" tab . this is the next thing i 'll be working on while you are away on vacation and i 'll probably just roll that one out myself once i 'm happy with it . talk : btw , i just had the following thoughts about the positioning of that new \" breakdown table \" in the article . originally , in my sandbox document , my sequence of \" status code \" definition ran as follows : ( ) fully define and explain the new \" squad status \" terms , such as \" youth \" and \" homegrown \" , in the inline text ; ( ) summarize those new terms in my ( now collapsible ) table and introduce the new tla coding for them ; ( ) use those tla codes in the \" breakdown table \" ; and ( ) finally use those tla codes in the pst . currently in the article there is no step ( ) , the pst is presented first utilizing tla codes that have yet to be defined for the user , yet he can immediately find out what they mean by looking up the definition of those t las by clicking on the collapsible tab . the moving around of sections in my sandbox document that i alluded to above was to align my document to that new sequence . which is , if we ignore the initial presentation of the inline text of old step ( ) : first old step ( ) - present the pst ; then old step ( ) - present the collapsible table of tla and terminology definitions ; and finally old step ( ) - utilize the newly defined tla codes in the \" breakdown table \" . : note that the \" breakdown table \" now really ought to come last in the sequence ( viz . after the t las have been defined in the collapsible table ) because it utilizes those tla codes . which means that \" breakdown table \" , if correctly placed , will sit between the pst and all the transfer and loan information , all of which is really a natural follow on from the pst . i do n't know how you feel about that consequences of placing the new table between the pst and the old transfer and loan sections , and i do n't have a solution to it to prof fer to you . all i 'm doing here is simply pointing out one of the consequences of the new ordering of these three items in your article . i do n't think that the non - inclusion of my lengthy inline text in the season article is an issue here because i do n't introduce the tla codes in that text . those codes are only introduced in the collapsible table ; thus it is the re - ordering of the other three items that is the cause of the problem . if , indeed , you feel there is a problem here . : talk : that 's all fine , i agree completely . and i apologise about the troubles you experienced with the collapsible table - i had n't realised that you would have javascript disabled ( i believe that was the problem ) and the solution that you and gonads devised i freely admit is better than my solution . i ag on ised over having no text showing but did n't think of creating the extra row on top to allow the show hide button to stay where it is , so in the end i gave up and went with the solution that you saw . having seen your counter - solution i wish i 'd thought of it in the first place . : re : the order of placement of the different sections , i tend to follow the accepted wikipedia position , which of course is mainly centred around the idea that these articles exist primarily for the purposes of di sp en sing as much useful information to casual readers as possible in as short an amount of time while not sacrificing quality or style - that is , the focus of the article should always be on the bits that casual readers want to read first . where terminology in tables is ambiguous , wp then recommends placing a section to follow which explains it thus to the reader . thus i kept the pst at the top of the section and placed the explanation stuff below . with the codes duly explained , the squad breakdown can be rolled out afterwards with no fear . conveniently , this is exactly the same order in which you have no decided upon for your own works . please do roll out the squad breakdown when you 're finished working on it by the way . i 'm sure it will contribute greatly , and the sooner it can be put in the article , the better . : i did not add the \" breakdown table \" while you were on vacation . this section is still ongoing imo . you probably need to ac qua int yourself with [ external link : this section ] on my talk page to get up to date with this particular topic on your return . you will also need to read everything else on my talk page that follows that section in order to get up to speed with everything else that has been discussed in the interim . happy reading . ) talk : have you read [ external link : this section ] yet ? do you have comments ? do all those [ external link : collapsible tables ] solve the issue of how to bury all that text ? note that in the material organization i 'm now recommending the [ external link : \" squad status breakdown table \" ] would appear in the article before the pst , so all my concerns expressed to you just before you left on vacation would now be moot . i need your feedback on this so we can put this issue to bed . talk the pst squad status information going forward finally , let me address the issue of what you might wish to do once mancini registers his - man squads with both the epl ( at the end of this month for the first half of the upcoming season ) and uefa ( i 'm not quite sure when exactly the europa league registration deadline is , but i 'm assuming it is probably the same date ) . if my understanding of the two squad registration requirements is correct ( step ) , and my understanding of the various players ' ages and youth backgrounds is also correct ( step ) , and my application of the two sets of requirements to all the players currently listed in the latest version of the pst ( step ) is also correct , then the above status codes are actually quite objective pieces of information ( i wo n't go so far as to say \" un contentious \" because as we all saw with my recent go - around with gonads , there are times and situations where even the information he is now defending from change was , only a few days ago , quite contentious ) . my assigned squad stat i merely classifies all the current first team squad players into four useful pools , and it does not try to second guess mancini 's ultimate - man \" epl squad \" and - man \" uefa squad \" selections ( should they differ ) . however , after both those - man squads are announced you could possibly then modify the above stat i to suitably reflect which competitions the various players are eligible to participate in ( which is the whole pur po ose of this classification process ) . how that is best done is a topic of discussion for another day . because the wisdom of going beyond what i 've already done in \" step \" above is something that needs some careful thought . if you did decide to go in that direction , the \" squad status \" information would change twice per season since the both squads have to be registered at the end of every transfer window ( thus allowing newly acquired and lo aned - in players to be added , and newly sold and lo aned - out players to be removed from the prior registration ) which would create a similar situation as exists for the new squad numbers every pre season . and that might create simply way too much editing contention\n",

      "the island of ul va lies off the west coast of the island of mu ll , which lies off the west coast of scotland which lies off the west coast of europe this tale is dedicated to sneaky mc ca ffer ty ' every night vanessa and kieran would lie in their bunk beds and listen to the stories read to them by mum or dad when the stories were finished and they had been tucked up safely in bed , or so mum and dad thought . the two would start their quiet conversations and make up their own stories . \" kieran there is something creeping around in the garden \" \" am i supposed to guess \" kieran answered , \" no come to the window look it 's about the size of a highland cow , but kind of longer \" . the two watched almost trans fixed as the something ' carefully moved along the rose bus hes , it seemed to be sni ffing or ni bbling the roses . now this pair were fearless , after all they took a small boat to school everyday plus they walked over two miles to get to school , always past the dead sheep ' , sometime kieran argued \" it might rise from being dead and chase us \" . \" teacher meg would never believe us if we went in late and we told her that we were chased by a dead sheep \" they both watched through the space in the curtain as this something ' moved about , vanessa was already pulling on outside clothes over her pa jam as as she watched , \" get dressed kieran \" , to late he was already clothed for outside . the two went slowly and quietly along the long hallway , listening to no ises coming from the kitchen , mum and dad seemed busy . vanessa opened the front door the pair slipped into the outside darkness . \" vanessa where do the stars go during the day ? \" asked kieran as he stared upwards at the dark night sky , vanessa finger at her mouth wh is pered \" shoo sh , we want to find out what the something is \" turning the corner of the cottage to where the rose bus hes are they saw it . it never saw them it was to intent in eating roses . the two moved in almost absolute silence , they were used to creeping up on rabbits and things . this was different , \" i think it 's a dragon \" wh is pered vanessa \" no it 's a giant i gu ana \" said kieran . the next few seconds left them frozen in time \" do n't be si wy i am a hungry dragon , and i can hear the grass grow so it re aw y does n't matter how quiet you are i can hear you \" . vanessa moved forward and wh is pered \" we are being quiet so that our mum and dad do n't hear us outside when we should be inside in bed \" . vanessa was putting on a brave face and trying to be kind of matter of fact . there 's no use in panic king when you meet something that is not supposed to exist . \" this is strange \" wh is pered vanessa \" am i dreaming or am i awake ? \" \" awake \" stated kieran \" it 's a dragon , no doubt , not an i gu ana , i gu anas do n't breathe fire \" both of their faces were il lu min ed by the orange glow that came from the mouth of the pe tal - eating creature . \" my name is klondyldyke i re aw y love these rose peta , pe tas , rose bits \" this meeting late one evening on the st of march introduced klondyldyke the dragon to vanessa and kieran , and to a multitude of questions , after all father said to them many times that \" half of knowledge is the question , and the other half is the answer \" march can still have a chill to it ; it 's that time of the year when the real new year begins . it 's the start to spring everything is growing the leaves are sp rou ting , flowers forcing their way through the ground , birds seeking out t wi gs , grass , sheep 's wool , anything that will make a place to bring forth new life . march , the time of new ness , new ideas and new discoveries , like a dragon ? \" klondyldyke we have to get back inside the cottage before its time to fall asleep \" said the extremely wide - eyed vanessa . kieran drum med his fingers on a stone as he considered just exactly what was happening \" am i dreaming or am i awake does it even matter ? do i see a dragon before me or do i not ? . if i go into the cottage and back to bed will what 's his name disappear ? which reality is the best awake or sleeping ? \" klondyldyke blew a soft glowing breath as the words sort of flu ffed out of his mouth , \" i suppose i have been discovered , why are you not scared ? why do you not run ? \" \" if you could see what we see you would not run \" replied vanessa \" y , yes \" stu ttered , stated , kieran \" we heard a noise and discovered a dragon , fantastic amazing \" thus vanessa and kieran , because of their curiosity came across the greatest secret that two children either within or without their dreams could hope to find , a real live dragon . klondyldyke explained where he lived or rather sl umbered through the day . \" up past the new stead ings turn left up the hill road then first right into the little field , i 'm the mound in the middle \" * it was one of those days when the rain had just stopped and out slips the sun . vanessa and kieran had set out from br ac ad ale to walk up the wide tree lined track to the new stead ings . vanessa being the eldest led the way , her little shoulder bag bouncing as she spl ashed in every puddle . \" why are my spl ashes not as big as yours \" asked kieran \" just because \" said vanessa \" why ? \" replied kier an the pair walked on through the sparkling light to the new stead ings at this point they turned left up the road that led up past the dam and on up to the big hills . most people headed on up the steep road to the hills , but not this pair they turned right along a path now only used by sheep , and ad ven turers . it opened up into a small field where in the middle there is a sort of mound , a tiny hill type thing . around the base a few rocks , and on top some sc rag gy silver birch trees with the usual mix of gr asses and wild flow ers vanessa and kieran knew of this place soon after coming to the island . they knew by now that it was not a hill type thing , but the reality of what it was went beyond what it actually appeared to be . they both sat on the soft dam p grass , looked at each other in great anticipation , \" your turn this time \" vanessa said . kieran touched what appeared to be a gray ish black rock , which really was not a rock . kieran spoke gently to the little hill \" wake up your friends are here \" there was a slight shudder ; the big brown black bird [ well all lady black birds are brown ] that had been sitting on a small sc rag gy silver birch tree flew away , with not so much a s qu awk as a kind of cho ked whistle . \" again , do it again \" urged vanessa , kieran obliged , he loved this bit , nobody in the whole wide world would believe them , not even their mum and dad , and they had some pretty unusual ideas . again he touched the rock , this time he kind of lifted it up from the dam p grass . it was dry underneath . the rock kind of stretched , the sort of m oun dish type tiny hill thing gave a great shudder . \" i am a hill , i am rocks , i am . i am hiding \" , then it gave itself away that s nor t that always came as it cleared its throat produced a f lic ker of flame and a bel ch of smoke . always during the transition between sleep and wake fulness klondyldyke gave himself away . this was not a mound of grass and sc rag gy silver bir ches surrounded by rocks , it was the secret hiding place of vanessa and kieran 's biggest best secret ever , in fact little did they know but it is probably the biggest best secret ever in the whole wide world , their very own dragon . by now they both knew only to go to klondyldyke on wet tish days the reason was simple . well simple to those who think carefully . if its scottish west highland wet there will be few people about , and the smoke from klondyldyke 's first bel ches would appear to be mist in the woods rather than what it really was , dragon breath smoke . but then there is appearance and then there is reality . with a few more shu dders a couple of slow gentle shakes klondyldyke slipped out from his tiny hill type disguise . vanessa and kieran stood looking at each other kind of pleased rather than at k lon dy le dyke who in turn looked down his long smoking sn out at his most recent of friends . then altogether they looked around , it was as if the world had stopped and they were inside another reality . klondyldyke 's body had a lovely green ish blue hue to it , a kind of petrol in a puddle blu ishness . two great wings were folded down the spine pointing towards a long tail , the back legs were slightly longer than the front , and at the end of each foot were four stony looking sharp ish claws . the big brown black bird 's yellow eyes looked down from the high branches of a nearby oak , she was using all her senses to detect what was happening as a kind of silence invaded the natural noise of the little field to right of the hill road . vanessa opened the shoulder bag she had been carrying , \" do you think dad will notice that we 've nic ked all the rose pe tals from his garden ? \" kieran laughed \" he would never believe why we took them \" . klondyldyke 's long sn out was t wi tching , little drops of water were starting to dri p from his mouth , some turned to steam as the touched his large sticking out teeth that were still hot from his dragon breath smoke . there was another small puff of smoke with a trace of flame as klondyldyke spoke , \" pe ase , pe ase [ he just could not pronounce lots of ls together it was the sticking out teeth and when he got excited ] pe ase can i have some pe tas ? \" vanessa held them up as the long tongue slipped out and gently lic ked them out of her hand . a flower eating dragon ? now there it seems is a problem most people would imagine that dragons capture ma iden s breath fer o cious fire and do all sorts of damage until stopped by some knight in shining armour , that may well be what most people think . however , who do you know that has really met a dragon ? just think what would you do if on some moonlight night you saw a dragon creeping about your garden ? thus we find our curious two sitting listening to the thoughts and stories of their very own dragon . \" take for example the ocean \" , pu ffed klondyldyke , \" it changes shape constantly a kind of cont in u os movement \" . \" ok \" said vanessa , \" we know the ocean or sea we cross it every day to go to school and its all around us we know its always moving , so ! \" \" sh ss \" said kieran . klondyldyke continued \" what i was going to tell you about was how the ocean is wik e , its kind of wik e as if all the people of the world were all winked together wik e one big we tness . \" a pause and a slight puff of smoke followed . \" what i 'm trying to say is that the people are wik e all the different waves on the ocean \" kieran was staring into space . vanessa was looking into the eyes of klondyldyke and as she stared she saw the ocean splash from one side to the other , \" i get it ! \" she shouted , \" we are all the waves of one ocean . \" the brown black bird hur tled of at a startling rate di pping , turning , flashing upwards through the trees . it was always like this , two sitting beside the dragon listening , talking , and exchanging ideas . klondyldyke sometimes referred to it as \" consultation \" , he said that if people really learned how to \" consult \" so many of the difficulties in the world could be removed . he even said that consultation was the re mo ver of difficulties . the preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : sign your posts on talk pages unsigned ] comment was added by\n",

i was about to close the deal with the vermont people i was going to take my commission and buy ferris a car what the hell are you doing ? are you trying to kill us ? look at this mess i 'll never get these papers back in order - slow down - i ca n't drive with you yelling at me ! hi , i 'm ferris bu el ler no , do n't get up that smells delicious - dinner 's ready - what ? who was that ? what 's wrong ? everything i just picked up je ani eat the police station she got a speeding ticket and i lost the vermont deal because of her looking for this ? i got you , fer ri show 's ferris ? let 's go in and check on him i have dreamed about this and this time you little bastard , i 've got you right where i want you ferris , we 're home how would you feel about another year at high school ? under my close , personal supervision ? hi thank god you 're all right we 've been worried sick about you thank you , mr rooney , for driving him home go upstairs and get in bed sco ot ! can you imagine someone that sick trying to walk home from hospital ? kids ! by the way , you left your wal leton the kitchen floor honey - he 's still awfully warm - how do you feel ? better , thank you do n't make me stay home again i want to go to school i have to graduate in june , and i ferris , you 're sick do n't push it and make yourself worse - maybe you 're right , dad - i know i 'm right , pal - how did you get to be so sweet ? - from years of pr ac tic e bl an ket get wel li 'm going to get myself settled , then i 'll bring you a hot cup of sou pi 've said it before and i 'll say it again : life moves pretty fas tif you do n't stop and look ar ound once in a while , you could miss it four years i 've been chasing this kid four years he 's been making a fool of me hey , mr rooney , what 's going on ?

      "is interstellar space travel possible ? large questions of this kind would make interesting articles , keeping in mind to maintain [ wiki link : neutral point of view neutral point of view ] and to make it work with the structure of other articles . so , on with the article . : i agree ! this article does not give any space for the alternative viewpoint , which is that interstellar travel is not possible . i suggest this page as [ external link : a reference ] . : also agreed . at very least the last sentence of the first paragraph of the article should be removed preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by the impossibility of human interstellar is established by the energy required . as an example , a calculation based on the kinetic energy equation shows that the energy required to accelerate the international space station to a velocity which would give a - year trip to the nearest star would be equivalent of almost , ther mon uc lear bombs , regardless of the propulsion system . i think this makes the whole article irrelevant except for a discussion of voodoo physics which might apply . : it 's a sliding scale . if you 're willing to have a trip that takes thousands of years , you can do it with a nuclear - electric drive with off - the - shelf parts ( delta - v of km sec would give you one light - year per thousand years during flight , and ability to stop at the destination ) . if you want the trip to take decades , on the other hand , you need a specific energy of about e j kg ( using a cruising speed of c , an exhaust velocity of c , and a craft that 's about fuel which is also used as reaction mass ) . this is about the right ballpark for fusion . for technologies that do n't require future break throughs , nuclear reactors get about . e j kg , and fission bombs get about . e j kg ( from ) . in both cases , you can build systems that put most of their reaction energy into moving their reaction products . assuming a craft that 's fuel , these power sources give you . c and . c , respectively . a bomb - driven [ wiki link : project orion ( nuclear propulsion ) orion ] - style craft , using the second value , would take about years per light - year , which is fast enough to be useful for generation ships and probes . a staged craft that was fuel could make a trip to the nearest stars within a human lifetime . : for sail craft , the energy cost is higher , but not un fe asi bly so . a light - sail gets a power - to - thrust ratio of about c , requiring about e j kg to send a probe on a fly by trajectory at c . a particle beam sail could in principle get much better ef fic i encies ( comparable to the specific energy needed for carrying your own fuel , but without having to carry your own fuel ) , assuming you can keep the beam focused over the boost distance . : now that i 've shown the math for the energies required , i 'll address your statements about these energies being un feasible . [ wiki link : uranium ] is about as common as [ wiki link : lead ] . [ wiki link : th orium ] is even more common . if you 're running a fission reactor on the ship , you have no shortage of fuel . assuming a generation - ship craft dry - weight of tonnes , you 'd need , tonnes for a half - speed craft and , tonnes for a full - speed craft ( cruising speed expressed as a fraction of the exhaust velocity ) . this is not cheap , but certainly feasible ( you 'd use a breeder reactor , so you can process the same depleted uranium that 's being used for bullets and armour ) . for a bomb - driven craft , you need to process about times as much un enriched uranium as you want u fuel ( abundance is . ) . this is more expensive , but still feasible ( it 's the price of going faster ) . : for a light - sail , a - tonne probe would require about e j ; say e j at a wall - plug efficiency . this is about tw - years . the electrical energy production capacity of the world ( from ) is a bit more than tw ( and - times this counting fossil fuel that 's burned directly for power ) . given that the cruise time of a c probe is decades , a boost time of several years is tolerable . total cost , at cents per kwh , would be about trillion . this is high , but not impossible . this is a high estimate , as electricity is considerably cheaper than this , and with a multi - trillion budget , you 'd spend some of it making more efficient lasers ( off - the - shelf industrial co lasers are - efficient ; diode lasers are much more efficient than this , but are expensive to scale up ) . a particle beam sail would have up to x lower electricity cost , but would be more expensive to develop ( the beam is harder to col li mate than a laser ) . : long story short , interstellar probes and ships are bu il dable ; just expensive . the real constraint to worry about is n't total energy required , but power to weight ratio of the systems that have to handle that energy ( having enough delta - v to get to c does n't help if it takes you a thousand years to accelerate to that speed ) . : this does n't mean that anyone 's going to build an interstellar probe any time soon . my point is that we have the ability to without any major break throughs or drastic re duc tions in price being required . : i hope this information addresses some of your concerns . : we are roughly in the situation now w r interstellar travel that we were w r to local ( ie , solar system ) space travel years ago . some could see then that travel to the moon was at the edge of the possible . ( a deb un ker had fun calculating the rocket size needed as being roughly the size of mt . everest , which was probably correct for his assumption of black powder as the pro pel lant . ) today we can see that large ( ? aircraft - carrier size ) ships traveling at of c are similarly at the edge of the possible , with no technical magic required . the trouble is , technology changes so fast , and so un predictably , that a mission design today would surely be obsolete long before the voyage could be completed . so we are not yet at the point where such a project can be rationally proposed , and really do n't know when we will be . thus we think about the possibilities , and watch the engineering realities as they change . : re power to weight & thrust to mass ratios , i agree completely . a possibly useful rule of thumb is that g acceleration gets you up to roughly c in year . so . g gets you to . c in years , very nearly . i would en vis age a - year acceleration phase at that rate , years co asting , and years to dec eler ate , for a lt - yr trip . the numbers you get for such thinking highlight the fact that the power - to - mass ratio of the propulsion system is really the critical issue for us be thinking about now . : today my standard guess is \" about one thousand years from now , maybe less \" for when the first mission will arrive at its destination . a daunting interval , but not vast even on the scale of human history . in i might have thought roughly the same about the moon . as it turned out , that was quite a bit less than a millennium . so i think we are wise to stress the difficult realities for those who do not understand them and expect to reach the stars in fifty years ; but not foolish to keep chewing on the problem as a realistic aspiration for the longer term future of the human species . : i find it 's most useful to pick an exhaust velocity ( or specific energy ) , and a power - to - weight ratio , and then find the resulting acceleration and delta - v , rather than starting with a desired acceleration and delta - v and working back to the other two . every so often you find a thread ( here or elsewhere ) that says a mass fraction of e : or what - have - you is needed , when you can take the same system , reduce the cruising speed by a factor of ( in the e case ) , and get a reasonable mass fraction . : useful numbers for comparison for power to weight ratio are about kw kg for internal combustion engines , and about to mw kg for jet turbines . higher values exist , but as a ballpark , this works . sail power to weight ratios depend on how thin you assume you can make it , but at . kg per square metre and k operating temperature , you end up with about mw kg for a light - sail craft that had most of its weight in the sail . the light - sail value gives you an acceleration of about . m s , and the mw kg ratio gives you an acceleration on the order of m s for a . c exhaust velocity and modest fuel fraction , assuming the non - fuel part of the ship is mostly engine . in both cases , practically achievable acc eler ations will be lower . you are right that the limitations of interstellar travel based on rockets is basically defined by the tsi ol kovsky rocket equation which is : ship velocity reaction velocity x the log of ( reaction mass ship mass ) . a ratio of ten gives a value log ( ) . which means the maximum ship velocity is . x reaction velocity . i think you wrote that the reaction velocity attainable with nuclear propulsion is , m s ( compared to that of present space rockets , around , m s ! ) which i calculate would give a travel velocity of , m s , resulting in a year round trip to alpha centauri . increasing the mass ratio to would just cut the trip to around . years . since the log of is only . but increasing the launch weight of the space station by a factor of would give a launch weight of , tons . considering that the weight of a battleship is , tons or so , that would pose a considerable launch problem . actually , unless the reaction velocity can be increased by a factor of hundred or so , it seems me that interstellar travel by even nuclear powered rockets is impossible . that seems to leave only solar sails , powered either by the sun or a earth based laser . here i think energy requirement becomes germane , for to achieve light velocity , assuming the mass of the space station , the energy required is some - billion tnt - tons or that of . million - kilo ton fission bombs i can not visualize this accomplished by photons . note that the trip would still take some - years . further , especially in the case of the laser , how does the ship shed this energy at its designation , land for exploration , and then reinstate it for the return trip ? especially of concern is shedding that energy upon return before it enters our atmosphere . failing to do so would obviously have very unpleasant consequences . : i think it parochial to consider , tons a truly in sur m oun table problem . as has been said , we have at our disposal now the means ( km s , if you like ) to colonize nearly the entire solar system ( excluding of course the rather substantial exceptions of the surfaces of jupiter and the other giants , and of venus ) . the asteroids in particular make billions of tons pla usi bly accessible , on a time scale likely to be short compared to that separating us from the great terrestrial ex pl or ations of the - th centuries . i agree that light sails , either solar or laser assisted , seem inadequate to solve the core difficulties , though they may be useful as parts of a larger scheme . i see no way that this program can be accomplished in anything like a traditional human generation of years ; we have to reconcile ourselves to the long - term view ( barring un looked - for help from fundamental new physics ) . one thing that i think has received inadequate attention is the possibility of useful and interesting destinations nearer than the closest stars , say in free - floating jupiter europa - like systems or pl u tino - like objects . deep ir surveys ( especially proper - motion surveys ) , should reveal ( or limit ) such possibilities fairly soon , and large ( ? texas - sized ! ) objects escaped from the edges of other solar systems really must be fairly common floating in interstellar space . not too cozy a prospect maybe , but like the first life emerging from the ancient ocean to colonize the land , we must be prepared to make use of what we find . cheers , : km sec was the exhaust velocity i quoted for nuclear - electric rockets built with off - the - shelf reactors and electric thru sters , with easily - attainable power to weight ratios . the actual maximum exhaust velocities are far higher ( . c and . c for breeder reactors accelerating their waste , and u bombs , respectively , using specific energy values quoted above ) . for cruising speeds , i assumed a rocket that was about fuel , with total delta - v of about twice its exhaust velocity . in principle , d d fusion can get exhaust velocities a few times this , but for purposes of this thread i 'm sticking with technologies that we have in - hand . : regarding slowing a sail down , [ wiki link : robert l . forward ] proposed a scheme where the main sail keeps moving , but the craft dep lo ys a smaller secondary sail for dec el ler ation . the main sail reflects laser light back at the secondary sail . in practice , this imposes serious design challenges ( laser drive distance has to be tens of light - years rather than one light - year or less , and the main sail has to be a well - behaved optical surface rather than a scattering reflector ) . that 's why i proposed sail craft only as probes above . any manned trip via sail craft would likely be one - way , with the expectation that the colonists would build the infrastructure needed to send ships back at some point in the future . : if you have a forward - type dec el ler ation scheme , and do n't want humans to stay in the target system long , you could use the main sail to give a x cruising velocity boost rather than x . this would send the ship back towards earth , rather than stopping it in the target system , but you 'd have very little time to do research there ( so i 'm not sure why you 'd send a manned ship vs . just an unmanned fly by probe in that case ) . on return to earth , you 'd use the original launch laser to slow down the returning sail craft . : regarding launch weight , tonnes would cost about billion at current launch prices ( , kg for unmanned cargo launches to leo ) . this is much less than the cost of electricity needed for a sail craft . : regarding sail craft power requirements , i remind you that world electrical production is about tw . this gives you the equivalent of a kt bomb every seconds , or about million kt per year ( per tw of power generation built for the project ) . : this kind of infrastructure is expensive , but well within the bounds of what could be built in a relatively short timeframe if we wanted to . i initiated this discussion because i thought that the \" difficulties of travel \" section in the main article should include a discussion of the required energy for interstellar travel for that seems to me is a basic measure of the difficulty . i propose something like this to follow the first paragraph of \" difficulties of travel \" another measure of the difficulty is the energy which must supplied to obtain a reasonable travel time . this is primarily a function of the velocity since the required energy goes up as the square of the velocity based on the fundamental kinetic energy equation e mv . the required velocity for a lifetime round trip to the nearest star is thousands of times greater than the present velocities which have been achieved for space travel . this means millions times as much energy must be supplied as now supplied to such vehicles as the space shuttle by chemical rockets . this energy is well beyond their capability and new methods of propulsion not yet developed would be required . i apologize for introducing such subjective judgments as \" impossible \" and getting argumentative which have no place in an encyclopedia . let me know your thoughts . paul kin tner : looks good ; by all means update the article text . the main concern ( with quite a lot of this article , not just your suggested change ) will be finding appropriate references ( per [ wiki link : wp : v ] , even if statements are correct , we need to show that someone else published them before including them in the article ) . add it either way , but if you can find a reference to cite that talks about it , even better . : i agree . i think it is essential for a credible article to face the problems squarely . i assume we will be making heavy use of extra - terrestrial materials and nuclear energy , but i will be quite surprised if it is not at least a few centuries before anyone begins to go beyond straw - man mission designs . at least we are making revolutionary progress on the astronomical observations side of the problem , so we should have a pretty good idea of where we are going , and what we will find there , before we depart . cheers , : you need to give a source for this , otherwise it 's [ wiki link : wp : or ] . interstellar travel in fiction it is probably worth having a seperate page for treatments of this subject in [ wiki link : interstellar travel fiction ] . with a few rare , honourable exceptions , fictional treatments of this subject make no attempt to coincide with reality . if you are interested in real world issues on this question , you can safely ignore [ wiki link : star trek star trek ] and almost every hollywood movie about space . paragraph headings some random headers for paragraphs i will write later if no - one does it first . possibility of new physics allowing faster than light travel possibility of reaching other stars by travelling slower than light , faster version and slower version : i would recommend a graph or two to summarize the issues , rather than whole sections . then you might want to wrap a section around a really good graph . biological vs . technological problem a couple of thoughts on the topic : there 's a comment , ( possibly by the english phy si ologist [ wiki link : j . b . s . hal dane j . b . s . hal dane ] ) that might be worth tracking down , that interstellar travel is more a problem in biology than technology : ie . the problem is our short lif esp ans compared with the travel times . i think it was hal dane ( or possibly [ wiki link : olaf sta ple don ] ) who came up with the idea of multi generation ' ar ks ' for interstellar travel . first vs . third person voice this is a very interesting article so far , and thanks to whoever has been working on it ! as a relatively minor point , can i ask you please not to write in the first person ? it 's rather grating in an encyclopedia article . time dilation and worm holes someone ( with more physics knowledge than me ) should talk about time dilation , which as i understand it means that while it will still take more than one year to travel one light - year , the slowing down of time for those on board the ship as its speed approached the speed of light would mean that those on board would experience the trip as taking as little time as one wants . ( of course , there is a limit here due to the amount of time it takes to accelerate at a rate humans could survive in comparison to the length of the trip . ) someone should also point out that general relativity may allow the shrinking of the distance between the origin and the destination of the trip , by bending space or creating worm holes . travel by humans vs . travel by robots interstellar travel by humans is a fantasy . humans will be replaced by [ wiki link : robot ] s long before interstellar travel becomes possible . : i do n't think that 's a consensus opinion , you have n't stated any reasons why you think that 's the case , and interstellar travel by robots or extra - ter restrials is worth discussing in any case . : the question of the future evolution of the human species ( pure biological , robot , or some kind of hybrid ) is very interesting , but essentially an independent issue . of course \" the nature of man \" and the future of human civilization affects most of the articles in this encyclopedia , but we can not let be more than an interesting footnote to this article , or we 'll go way off track . imho . alpha centauri movement footnote , and link concerns i removed the following from the article ( which is very cool ! ) . i 'll explain why : ( * ) actually our solar system and alpha centauri are moving relative to each other at several kilometres per second , and as far as i can remember , they are moving approximately towards each other , so this should reduce travel time a little . it would still be thousands of years though . : * this point was precisely addressed in first ark to alpha centauri - a sci - fi novel concept about sending the first human interstellar ark on a , year long voyage duration by some unknown author , named [ wiki link : a . a had ] . see my footnote below first ark to alpha centauri by a . a had . the continents on earth are moving , too . it does n't affect our travel plans that much . - ) we do n't have footnote capability yet ; just use parentheses . maybe someone can put this back in the articlei do n't really want to edit it myself , mainly because i might screw it up . also , we want to avoid first person . if the reason you use first person is because you 're not sure of something , why are you putting it into an encyclopedia article ? : [ wiki link : talk : time travel ] having a link to a talk page in the article itself is not a good idea . : for information on the technical difficulties of interstellar travel , see [ wiki link : spacecraft propulsion spacecraft propulsion ] , [ wiki link : astronomy astronomy ] , [ wiki link : physics ] , [ wiki link : chemistry chemistry ] , [ wiki link : biology ] , [ wiki link : psychology psychology ] , and [ wiki link : economics economics ] . i 'm sorry , but only the first of those pages actually contains any information obviously relevant to the technical difficulties of interstellar travel . either find more specific pages , or , if you want to make a claim , make a claim : \" our understanding of the technical difficulties of interstellar travel is informed by multiple fields : . \" do n't mislead people into thinking that they 're going to be able to find information about the difficulty of interstellar travel just by following those links . fast interstellar travel methods from [ wiki link : robert zu brin ] [ wiki link : robert zu brin ] 's ( the guy behind the [ external link : mars society ] ) \" entering space \" , where he discusses possible interstellar travel given currently known physics . he comes up with a couple of seemingly feasible systems - fusion powered ships , lights ails powered by lasers , and \" mag sails \" ( which would be used in combination with the other systems for braking at the other end ) . with these systems , one - way trips to alpha cen tur i within a current human lifetime ( and , remember , greatly extended human lif esp ans are entirely feasible given progress in medical research ) are at least plausible . anti matter - powered star ships could theoretically permit travel at near - light speed ( mo dul o the shielding problem from any stray atoms in the road ) but production of anti matter seems likely to be a considerable challenge in economics , to say the least . zu brin makes a persuasive and seemingly scientifically reasonable case ( but then , i 'm not a physicist ) . do people think it 's worthwhile for me to add some material based on ( obviously not copied from ) his book ? : sounds like it would be a good contribution to the article . it could always go in the biography article on him if people dont want it here anyway bus sard ram jets something on bus sard ram jets , as a possible way of getting to high enough speeds that time dilation comes in ? : unfortunately , it turns out that the density of interstellar hydrogen is an order of magnitude less than it was thought to be when bus sard first proposed the design . but i guess it should still be mentioned , as an idea which did n't pan out . : another problem with the current text : as the reaction providing the energy is the proton - proton reaction converting less than . of mass , the problem is essentially the same as for a fusion rocket engine , max speed at most . c . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : i am no friend of the bus sard ram jet concept ( which i think absurd in practice ) , but the fundamental energy limitation that prevents rockets from reaching relativistic speeds does not apply to them , because they take their energy from the interstellar medium , not from fuel carried along . thus the [ wiki link : rocket equation ] does not apply . their problems have to do with the mass and drag involved in the vast ( ? magnetic ? ) input scoop , and the problems of the losses involved in compressing and burning h effectively to produce thrust , which entail mind - boggling engineering difficulties . suspended animation maybe a discussion of the possibilities and difficulties of suspended animation\n",

( though i doubt it ) . please first read the mediation archives . crum was the only ob j ec tee on the basis of the meaning of the word ' since ' . : we 've been thru this countless times . shinnick signs his name as ' phd ' , but we have no idea what field it 's in and where he got the title . when he presented himself to a congressional sub - committee , he said he 's an ex - athlete , iirc . it seems he is a health practitioner of some kind , but we really have no formal credentials for him as a scientist trying to present controversial scientific evidence . as to the publication itself , we have no proof that this article underwent peer review by any reputable scientist . we can get into all these issues deeper , of course , and i suspect we will . remember that per wp and jimbo , when we present extraordinary claims , we need extraordinary support . here 's what i found on shinnick : phillip shinnick , ph . d . ' holds a new york state license in chinese medicine and has a clinical office on park avenue . he directs the research institute of global o hy siology , behavior and treatment . an ambassador of unesco , he is also chairman of athletes united for peace affiliated with the department of public information of the un . after earning his mpa , he . received his ph . d . from u . c . berkeley and was an assistant professor in sociology and history at rutgers and new york medical school ( epidemiology ) . he is a writer , publishing in scientific journals and in media such as the new york times . it 's from [ external link : this ] ; the it does n't say what his ph . d . is in , but it does say he was ( which i found at other places ) a med school as st . prof in epidemiology . - crum , any other objections ? i realise it would seem good for the bdort to use this citation , but it exists , it is board - certified md peer reviewed , the journal states this explicitly ; it is an independent journal . there is not much you can do about it . you are the only one in the last round of mediation that objected to it , i understand this leads on from your bias , but there it is all the same . your last argument was what the word ' since ' meant , in regard to the peer - review status of the journal , which i told you my opinion about . che ? i do n't see how a man with a phd in an unknown and undeclared field can be used as a high quality [ wiki link : wp : v wp source ] to support an outlandish medical claim about a procedure that will quickly and easily diagnose and cure most diseases known to mankind . this is exactly what jimbo referred to by explaining how for extraordinary claims we need extraordinary high quality sources . the publication itself , as i noted before , does not tell us that it was actually peer reviewed at the time shinnick 's article was published and or that his article was in fact reviewed by any medically and scientifically qualified person . hence i consider this an unacceptable scientific source . : his ph . d . is n't really what 's in question . what 's in question is whether he 's an expert in chinese medicine , as his stated objective is \" to provide an independent analysis of the o - ring as it is applied to the traditional chinese main meridian system , and to examine this technique 's applications in clinical medicine . \" do you think that holding a new york state license to practice chinese medicine qualifies him as an expert in it ? - : his qualifications to design , perform and report on a clinical study are in question , and his phd title is essential to inform us of his background . a phd in an unknown undeclared subject leaves the issue of his credentials as a clinical scientist unresolved . as far as the objectives of the study , as you say he says he will \" examine this technique 's applications in clinical medicine \" , in addition to the traditional chinese components . ' clinical medicine ' is mainstream medicine . i believe he would have to show proper credentials and background ( at a minimum board - certified md ) to make any scientific statement about mainstream medicine . : \" clinical medicine \" does not equal \" mainstream medicine \" . according to the american heritage sted man 's medical dictionary , \" clinical medicine \" is \" the study and practice of medicine based on direct observation of patients \" . which is in keeping with the definition of \" clinical \" , which is \" concerned with or based on actual observation and treatment of disease in patients rather than experimentation or theory \" . he is in fact making claims on how to treat patients , but not within the bounds of mainstream medicine . as a licensed practitioner of chinese medicine , do n't you think he 's an expert on clinical chinese medicine ? - : i am at a loss as to where you find that \" clinical medicine \" is not part of \" mainstream medicine \" . all the definitions i am aware of , including yours , which i will use here , effectively say : \" the study and practice of medicine based on direct observation of patients . \" ( emphasis mine ) . unless you otherwise quantify it , and especially in the western world , the word ' medicine ' as in \" practice of medicine \" in your own quotation means mainstream , not alternative medicine . in the west , \" doctor of medicine \" ( no qualifiers ) md mainstream , \" school of medicine \" mainstream , \" internal medicine \" mainstream , etc . if you wish to get someone else 's opinion on this point , which i think is fairly important , since this article involves alternative medicine , i would be pleased to hear other opinions . : how about we get the opinion of the dictionary i quoted from ? here 's what sted man has to say on medicine : the science of di ag no sing , treating , or preventing disease and other damage to the body or mind . : the branch of this science encompassing treatment by drugs , diet , exercise , and other non surgical means . : the practice of medicine . : do you dispute that bdort fits that definition ? - : i agree that the definition that you quoted is the generic term , which would encompass both western mainstream as well as alternative medicine . but my point was that in conventional usage in the west , the word ' medicine ' as in the sample items i used above , implies \" conventional \" . thus , in the west , if you hear the words \" school of medicine \" , \" internal medicine \" , \" doctor of medicine \" , etc . you assume that these are all mainstream . it is this implication assumption that i am referring to . so if in the west someone says \" clinical medicine \" , unless otherwise qualified , the implication is that it 's conventional and not alternative , just like the other items . : with all due respect , crum , do n't be ludicrous . are you really going to argue with a medical dictionary over the definition of clinical medicine ? and based on a \" some people say \" argument ? if it looks like a duck , and it sounds like a duck , and the american heritage duck dictionary says it 's a duck , then it 's a bleeding duck . you may not like it any , but it 's comes from people whose job it is to define these sorts of things . you 're grasping at straws covered in grease . phillip shinnick is a licensed practitioner of chinese medicine , which means he practices clinical medicine , even if it is alternative medicine . - : well , trying my best to follow your duck analogy in chinese medicine ( i 'm assuming this is not [ wiki link : peking duck ] ) , i still do n't quite follow you . i am not arguing with the dictionary definition , i accept it , as a broad and generic definition of ' medicine ' . what i am saying is that the accepted definition of ' clinical medicine ' in the west is normally conventional clinical medicine and not ' alternative medicine ' . to me , reading shinnick 's objectives , it is clear that he is using bdort for clinical medicine in general , not just the chinese variety . the article was published in the west , hence the connotation assumption is that the ' clinical medicine ' he is talking about is conventional ( aka mainstream ) clinical medicine , not only chinese . if you can show me proof , instead of your words , that shinnick is referring only narrowly to chinese clinical medicine in his study and paper , then i would see it differently . but as of now , it seems fairly clear to me that he is talking about both . : it seems pretty clear to me that shinnick does n't say a word about conventional medicine . alternative and complimentary medicine often claim to reach similar ends by different means , and that seems to me to be what shinnick is saying . it does n't look like he has anything to say about traditional surgery , medicines , ect . the fact that shinnick talks about using bdort on his patients seems to me to be a pretty clear indication that he as well is using the above definition of \" clinical medicine \" . i propose to you the exact opposite challenge : show us a place in the article where he makes a claim about traditional medicine . - : i would consider this fairly ' conventional medicine ' : ra di ography showed bone - density loss , anterior ver te bral o ste ophy tes , and hip restriction of side - bend . the diagnosis was disk disease degeneration of the lum bo sac ral spine , somatic dysfunction of the cervical spine , arthritis , and o ste op oro sis . i doubt that ancient chinese medicine had ra di ography available . hence , once he starts discussing modern ra di ological studies and results , he needs to be a radio logist , or at least an md . at this point we have no proof that he is either one . : it seems to me ( and i may be wrong here , i 'm not sure ) that he 's talking about diagnoses that other doctors made there . i do n't believe he practices co ven tional medicine , so when he says \" after the usual conventional medical procedure . \" etc , i assume it refers to what happened before his patients came to him . do you agree with this assessment ? - : let 's assume you are right , and examine the implications . he is untrained in conventional medicine ( we are assuming ) but is brought a patient that is shown to have problems based on conventional medicine . he then applies bdort - related techniques and claims the patient is better . to me that 's a combination of conventional and alternative medicines , which is my point : he is using bdort in a combined conventional and alternative medical environment . now think about it for a second : if in fact the patients improve , why would n't someone else there , like a regular medical doctor trained in conventional medicine , write ( and sign ) the paper and say : we did x , y , z and the patient improved ? i think you 've lost the forest for the trees . is there any independent credible evidence for the truth of the claim to peer review the journal makes for itself ? if so , where in a credible source is the journal cited ? if shinnick is a reputable researcher with credentials , is there any evidence for this assertion other than his having made the assertion ? these are simple questions . they should have clear , simple answers , not people pe ering into dictionaries asking what ' is ' means . : keep it simple . we can verify who he is ( see che 's ref re him above ) , the source is neutral and reliable ; the journal states it is peer - reviewed by mds . ( crum can not do wp : or and try to investigate journals to compare the peer - re vie we dness that they state ) . we can say that the study took place , who was involved , what they did , what was their stated objectives and what did they claim to find . all of that is wp very good . : i think , che , i am loosing trust that mediation will ever work , and that arbitration is the best way to go , as crum 's only once revealed underlying ( well - intentioned ) bias that you noted is so strong . i 'll wait a bit longer , but even in this example , at least other admins in mediation so far accepted this citation but crum is willing to argue down to what the word ' since ' means etc in order to somehow find a way not to allow it . also when biases exist and have been revealed , but are not declared openly , can you understand that good faith has much less meaning in reality ? ( from above ) now we 're getting somewhere : the claim is that , in order to base his practice off diagnoses made by other people , he ought to have an expertise in the methods which were used to make those diagnoses . but remember , whether or not it actually works is not for us to say . whether or not a conventional doctor signed a paper saying \" yep , shinnick cured this patient \" is immaterial . what we 're interested in here is what shinnick says about bdort , not what other doctors say about it ( those discussions are for the other disputed sources ) . so , does shinnick need expertise for diagnoses that he does n't make ? - : let 's say shinnick , assuming he is not a trained doctor , has a magic wand that is claimed to diagnose cure all . all he would need is a doctor to bring in the patient , testify as to the patient 's prior condition , let shinnick work his magic , then the doctor tests the patient and t esti fies as to results . assuming the doctor then published the study in a reputable peer reviewed journal , wp would accept this even if there are contradictory results and detractors , etc . otoh , what we have here is shinnick , a non - md , alone signed on the paper , for which we have no proof of peer review , and the paper describes procedures that at least partially rely on conventional medicine techniques . given that the claims made are extraordinary , wp requires extraordinarily high quality sources . i do n't see how this could be described as such . : so we ca n't use shinnick to say that bdort works , but i am not sure whether the intention here . so the question is , what are we trying to source with the journal article ? - : i guess this is a good time for richard to tell us what he wants to do with this paper . as i wrote above , very simply , we can relate what is described according to this reliable , neutral article : the bi - digital o - ring test , in its claimed application of detecting the ' electromagnetic resonance phenomenon ' between two identical substances or electromagnetic fields was tested by phillip shinnick phd , celia blum enthal md , adri ano bor gna md and jacob heller md , in a clinical research trial over a four year period involving patients with localized pain at the center for sports and osteopathic medicine in new york from to . during the study the bdort was applied di ag no s tically without knowledge of the standard western diagnoses that had been made earlier of the patients involved . according to shinnick et al , the bdort was able to detect the internal organ that was the causal factor of the pain arising from a referred acupuncture meridian phenomenon . the findings of this study were peer - reviewed by board - certified physicians . note that this says what shinnick says , not what the article says ; in short it is a citation that provides nuts and bolts information rather than justifications , proofs etc . : since we do n't have a source other than shinnick to say that this is what shinnick did , should it say \" bdort allegedly was applied . \" ? - : obviously this would not be acceptable . first , the md 's are not signed off as authors in the paper . second , a ' clinical research trial ' is clearly not restricted to chinese medicine , if there was any doubt of that , which proves that shinnick would not be qualified as an author of such a study unless he has credentials we do n't know about . third , we have no proof the paper was peer reviewed , which would be required for a scientific article making extraordinary claims . bottom line : i see no way that a person who is not a doctor can make ( or even ' allege ' ) statements in a clinical study to prove a radically new medical procedure , that would be acceptable on wp . all the other people , who appear to be md 's are not signed off on the paper and hence are not a factor here . ( and i am not going to speculate here why they did n't sign off as co - authors on a paper summarizing a study that they supposedly participated in ) . okay wait . so if i follow all this you are saying that shinnick says he 's qualified , but he does n't actually say what his qu ali f cations are , and he 's published in a journal that says it 's peer reviewed , but that there are no credible references for ? what , precisely , are shinnick 's qualifications , where , other than in his own business which he describes himself in an alumni magazine of some sort ? i 'm not saying he is n't necessarily qualified , but where , other than in his own words , in a journal that no one seems to have any independent reference to , is there any evidence for any of this . anyone can describe themselves anyway they want and anyone can publish something that says whatever they want . businesses are thr won out of wp all the time for this kind of naked self - f promotion and advertising . is this any different in any way anyone can actually check ? you people all throwing out opinions inter pre tings words out of dictionaries . do you have any actual verifiable facts to verify this man 's claims or this journals claims . or would an actual verifiable fact be too much to ask ? you prefer word games and opinion ating ? : no , not exactly : what we are saying is that shinnick is a licensed practitioner of chinese medicine which makes him qualified to speak on . chinese medicine . that 's very easy to check , and it 's been checked . now , shinnick says he 's used bdort , so we 're saying that . shinnick uses bdort . that 's all rather simple . : by the way , to say \" businesses are thrown out of wp all the time \" is simply untrue . articles on businesses are deleted often , true , but to be banned requires a lot more . : by the way , if you 're going to take part in these p rec ed ings which you are welcome to do please try to be constructive . - you do un dr stand right that you are busy arguing and looking up words about people pulling their fingers apart ? has anyone ever even heard of this ? they would ' nt believe it you know . : che , are we in agreement then , that richard 's sweeping statement above , basically saying that bdort has been ' clinically proven ' by shinnick et al is not acceptable ? if so , what can we use shinnick for , if anything ? : i think it 's pretty clear that the article supports the fact that shinnick , a practitioner of chinese medicine , claims to have successfully tested bdort . is that not enough ? - che , you are not coherently and consistently addressing the criteria for inclusion as to reference in this entry . reference to wp criteria 's existence is insufficient imho . what , precisely , as moderator , is your interpretation of those criteria as applicable to this entry ? use small words . i 'm slow , but i 'll see if i can keep pace with a s wi f ter and sub tler intellect , fair enough ? : whiffle , i 'm attempting to discuss this entry . i have n't come to a solid conclusion about this citation i 'm attempting to stimulate discussion , posing questions challenges to the others involved , and attempting to find out what the real issues below the conflict over this citation ( if not the article as a whole ) are . - i thought your job was to moderate , that is to facilitate the parties coming together in a more functional manner how is that process aided by your acting as a judge while denying you 're a judge ? you clearly have an atheist and a believer , here . do you expect to reconcile them ? that wo n't happen , ever . do you expect to judge for them ? neither party will accept that , in the end , and you know it . do you actually have a plan here ? you seem to be unwilling to state your criteria other than to allude both to wp and to your feeling very strongly that you are to interpret that f le xi bly as you think best . what does that mean , in the end ? : first , i do n't expect to judge . i do n't care what richard or crum or you or anyone else thinks . really . could n't care less . : second , i 'm never going to get richard and crum to agree on the merits ( or lack thereof again , i do n't really care ) of bdort , and have nothing even remotely resembling a desire to do so . seriously . do n't care . : but what i can do is encourage them to get deep down into the issues , discuss things in terms of policy ( which always has to be interpreted ) , and challenge them to re evaluate the assumptions that they bring to the table . that 's the only possible way to achieve consensus . that , or either richard or crum leaving . and i have no desire to see richard or crum leave , because i believe they are both good editors . i do have a desire to see them come to some sort of agreement on how to apply wikipedia policy to this article . : my criteria are quite simple : applying wikipedia policy in the way which makes the most sense . i realize that this will be slightly different to everyone , and i readily accept that . and if i challenge something that crum or richard says , it 's not because i necessarily think they are incorrect , but because i want to challenge them to think of things in a different way . : so that 's my plan . if you do n't like it , you do n't have to pay any attention to it . i assume , however , that crum and richard are both alright with the way i 'm doing things , because they 're still here . ( of course , guys , i do n't want to put words in your mouths , so reply to that with however you feel , if you feel the need to do so . ) - crum , you misrepresent what i wrote , i do not say that has been clinically proven . where did i say that ? i said what i said , that shinnick did what he did and wrote what he wrote in the journal that is reliable and neutral ( that way back in discussion after i pinned down what you required re this citation you agreed was ) . are you saying that we cant say that what shinnick says he did ? : richard , to me if someone is saying , effectively , \" the procedure was tested in a peer reviewed study and was able to detect the causal factor of pain \" ( my paraphrasing ) , it is another way to say \" clinically proven \" . i do n't accept the article was peer reviewed as we have no proof of that , i do n't accept that shinnick is qualified to design , perform or write about a clinical study , as we have no proof of that , i do n't accept that wp may cite as a source such a reference since it does not meet its criteria for excellent sourcing that are needed when extraordinary claims are made , as is the case here . i hope this makes my position clearer . crum , it is a perfectly reliable , neutral , source , and can be used perfectly fine in wp policies as such , to say what it says . a claim can be reported quite simple without wp claiming anything , many admins have told you this already . re the peer - review status , what criteria are you using to decide if a journal by mds for mds that says that all its articles are peer - re vie e wed are not peer - reviewed ? what normal \" proof \" are you talking about , give an actual example of this please ? che , comments ? : i will assume this unsigned message is from richard and not from mr . whiffle or someone else . : just because you say something is reliable or neutral , does n't necessarily make it so . in the case of extraordinary claims every source has to be proven reliable and neutral . let me start with your point about \" by mds for mds \" . if this is true , as they claim , then why is this apparently medical paper written by shinnick , a non - md with an unknown phd ? does n't this cast doubt over the publication ? : now , i am not sure what you mean about \" admins telling me \" - and i am not sure if that is wp policy that admins are the official interpreters of wp sourcing policies , but let 's take your statement about \" wp claims \" . you are saying that \" a claim can be reported quite simple without wp claiming anything \" . i beg to differ . according to my admittedly limited understanding , in a controversial article making extraordinary claims such as this one , we can only include statements that are backed up by excellent sources . if there are no such sources available , the statement stays out . now let 's get to the \" peer reviewed \" issue . you gave us a pointer to a statement that said the journal has been improved over the years in various ways , including by adding peer review . it does not say exactly what year the peer review was added , and we do n't know if this article was in fact peer reviewed , and if so by whom . we certainly have no references to this paper or journal in the mainstream press that i am aware of . bottom line : this medical paper was written by a person with no proven medical credentials , in a journal that has no mainstream references , with no mainstream references to the paper . it does not meet the definition of ' excellent ' sourcing that would be required when making extraordinary or outlandish claims , and hence can not be included . : crum , what you 're saying would absolutely be true if we were trying to make claims about bdort as a procedure . claims about bdort 's efficacy would indeed be extraordinary claims . however , the fact that shinnick has attested to bdort 's efficacy is in fact a rather mundane claim . similarly , the fact that shinnick claims that his experiment was successful is a rather mundane claim . : in the absence of extraordinary evidence regarding bdort , mundane evidence regarding the belief in bdort serves a significant function . take , as analogy , [ wiki link : creationism ] : to attest to the factual accuracy of creationist theories would indeed require extraordinary evidence , evidence which in fact is not present in the article . but the article does n't attest to creationism what it does handle is the belief in creationism , without making judgments about the belief one way or the other . : it seems to me that the shinnick paper is rather good evidence of the fact that some medical professionals ( ie shinnick and his research partners ) recognize bdort as legitimate and use it . : would n't you agree ? - : yes , i agree that there are non - md ' alternative medicine ' practitioners who apparently use bdort . we already know about gorringe , and what happened to him , and apparently shinnick is ( or was ) also such a person . if the issue is \" are there some people who use bdort ? \" - then we know of ( besides omura and his colleagues ) . how to plug that statement into the article , and where , i am not exactly sure . as che says , we can use this citation as i originally suggested , to say not only that these people have used it , but the fact that they have in their opinion tested it and in their opinion recognize that it is valuable and can do what they ' found ' it can do . the extraordinary claims argument , as che says , does not apply . : no , i think that 's much too broad . we do n't know that ' these people ' used it - they are not signed off on the paper , shinnick is . shinnick claims in the paper they ' helped ' him - but how exactly it 's unclear ( to me ) . did they actually try to force open the patients ' fingers ? did they just observe ? did they just let shinnick do it alone with the patients ? very unclear to me , hence i do n't see how this can support a statement that anyone but shinnick apparently used bdort . now you say ' they ' \" tested it and in their opinion recognize that it is valuable \" . i do n't see anyone but shinnick making such a statement , and he 's not an md , so he ca n't really make any scientific statements , we can only say he used bdort . so , we have evidence that one person , non md , besides gorringe who got fined and stripped , used bdort ( excluding omura ) . i am not sure how to use or present this info - maybe che has an idea ? : crum brings up the legitimate point that there is no corroboration to shinnick 's article . it seems to me that none of the others involved in the study whether or not they agree with shinnick 's findings have come out and attested to his findings . nor have they , on the other hand , disputed them . anything that comes from that paper will essentially be a quotation or paraphrase from shinnick . - no , crum , you are incorrect . in , with the assistance of celia blum enthal , md ( holding the probe ) , and herbert berger , di pl ob t ( as the subject ) , and the author testing the finger strength , imaging was done for the lung , with a cigar as the toxic substance taped to the wrist and the mu lung point as the control reference . that 's clear , they directly participated . ( so did bor gna md ) . just takes a bit of reading . again for the x time , now about the ' scientific ' question . you have to define what you mean by this word that you use . for example in no way whatsoever did the nz trib uni al do anything scientific - unless you define ' scientific ' as sitting and thinking and giving opinion . so ) you must define what you mean by scientific , and ) then we will agree eventually on a definition for it here , and then later apply that consistently to the trib uni al citation ( that had zero science in it and so can never be cited as a scientific evaluation ) . what shinnick did do was an ex per i ement . experiments are at temps to find out things , which is what most of the planet regards as science . so i leave it to you to define what you understand by science , how you wish to use the word here , and i am guessing that we will end up substituting another word for what you term science , which will probably be ' opinion ' . next , your equating md with science is also a clear mistake . your statement that a non - md cant make a scientific statement or test is incorrect . so what you go on to say is also incorrect . so what we might actually have is what che says , that : we can use this citation as i originally suggested , to say not only that these people have used it , but the fact that they have in their opinion ( or maybe in shinnick 's evaluation only ) tested it and stated their his recognition that it is valuable and can do what they he ' found ' it can do . and we can add in some details of what they did as any blank report of a topic might contain , as i originally suggested above . : i believe what crum is saying is that the paper itself was written solely by shinnick , even if other people helped , and that we thus have to take shinnick 's word for whatever they said did . - yes , che 's analysis is obviously correct , and furthermore , regarding the ' experiment ' issue : anyone can perform an experiment and ' prove ' whatever . that is not automatically acceptable on wp . for excellent sourcing , as required in this case , the investigator author has to be properly c re den ti alled , and his her report paper has to be published and peer reviewed . the publication would have to be reputable for mainstream science ( i . e . referenced by well known reputable mainstream publications ) , and ideally the paper should have multiple references in the mainstream press . in our case here we have none of the above . i agree with the shinnick as author idea , however that the other people assisted is equally correct and can be stated ( they are also mds ) . crum , you are effectively attempting to evaluate the citation 's contents - this is not your task as an editor . the citation in itself is what matters , which is neutral , reliable as yourself agreed long ago back in discussion ( see archives of talk ; you only argued back then re the usefulness of the citation ) . it is also peer - reviewed , as this reliable , neutral source states explicitly , i will not accept your attempt to somehow discredit this ( again you were the only one in the previous mediation round which included a number of admins that attempted to do this , which also remarks on wp policy re this citation showing that you did not get agreement or anything near such when you tried to previously ) . i just cleared up the mistaken argument re the scientific bit you presented . this should not be confused with the content and the ability we have to present what they did and claimed . and this we should . we need to be careful not to confuse points . so what che said : that the shinnick paper is rather good evidence of the fact that some medical professionals ( ie shinnick and his research partners ) recognize bdort as legitimate and use it and the details about it we can report plainly without judgement , is perfectly fine and moreso , very useful ; nothing that has been argued so far , on any l sis , says anything against that . if we were using the cite to put forward opinions about bdort , that of course would not be ok . but that is not the case . lastly , crum , as you know the trib uni al word for word said early on that they recognized that gorringe did not use omura 's technique , and no amount of un allowable wp : or viz the trib uni al article by a wp editor will ever change that . the only thing we will be able to say is as you said previously , they ruled on pmrt generically . but lets keep to this citation please ( and please bring up others in their place , thanks ) . : richard : where exactly does it say that this article is peer - reviewed ? - : as i tried to convey to richard several times , his ' peer review ' reference above does not say that the shinnick article , written in , was peer reviewed . all it says is that many changes were made in the journal over the last years , and one of them is that peer review was instituted . it does not say when exactly the peer review was added , and more importantly and specifically , it does not say that the shinnick article itself was peer reviewed . it also does not mention the actual names and qualifications credentials of the peer reviewers - if they were more shin nicks reviewing shinnick that would not help us much in establishing the scientific merits of this paper . as i noted earlier , the publication also claims that the articles are written by ' physicians to physicians ' , where clearly the shinnick article was not written by a physician , hence the publication 's claims about itself are contradictory . : and as i mentioned above , i agree that this reasonably establishes that one non - md , in addition to gorringe ( excluding omura himself and colleagues ) , has used bdort . it is unclear to me how to present this in the article and i asked for che 's opinion on this . richard , i hate to break it to you , but crum 's reading of the editorial is in fact the only correct syn tactical reading of that sentence in english . \" changes have been made since \" is not linguistically equivalent to \" changes were made in \" . this can be clearly seen in the following : one of the \" changes made since \" is the increase of publication from twice to three times yearly ( number ) . volume lacks an issue , which means that as late as , this change had not yet been imp li mented . so it is clearly false to say that change , \" publication was increased from twice a year to times a year , \" was implemented in . but it has been implemented since . crum may be a stic kler for precision , but in this case he 's correct . the editorial does not say that all articles since have been peer reviewed . it says that \" all articles became peer reviewed \" some time after , just like \" publication was in c re ac ed from twice a year \" some time after ( in the latter case , in ) . thus we can not say , without further evidence , that this article was peer reviewed , because we do n't know whether it was or not . if other people agreed that it had to be peer reviewed based on that editorial , they either read it incorrectly or did n't understand the sentence , and they certainly did n't take thirty seconds it took me to do the check that i did . this does n't mean that the source is automatically thrown out , but it does mean it ca n't be used as a peer reviewed source unless we can be sure it 's actually peer reviewed . - : che , in defense of the ' other people who agreed ' , i am not aware at present of a single person who agreed with richard 's reading . since all discussion is archived , it would be very useful if richard can point us in the record to one single person ( besides himself ) who agreed with that interpretation . : i looked through . it looks like ag u i err o assumed that it was peer reviewed . and the rest is hard to tell , because not all the comments are signed . - : i also looked ( to refresh my recollection ) and no one agreed with richard that \" since \" means \" on \" . in fact , no one ( except for me ) even addresses his point . you ( che ) are the first one to consider it on the record , as far as i know . ag u i err o , as you note , was speaking generically and making assumptions , and that was prior to richard 's ' since ' ' on ' assertion . ok , but it is still a reliable neutral source that can be used to say who did what and what they siad thought . effectively , then , we have : the bi - digital o - ring test , in its claimed application of detecting the ' electromagnetic resonance phenomenon ' between two identical substances or electromagnetic fields was according to phillip shinnick phd , with the help of celia blum enthal md , adri ano bor gna md and jacob heller md , tested in a clinical research trial over a four year period involving patients with localized pain at the center for sports and osteopathic medicine in new york from to . according to shinnick 's report , during the study the bdort was applied di ag no s tically without knowledge of the standard western diagnoses that had been made earlier of the patients involved . according to shinnick et al , the bdort was able to detect the internal organ that was the causal factor of the pain arising from a referred acupuncture meridian phenomenon . based on thr ashed out discussion so far . : crum ? - chen o dice . when wp requires excellent sources for an outlandish claim , that means we need a peer - reviewed article published by a properly c re den ti aled author in a respectable publication . the article and the publication should have multiple references in the mainstream press to prove re spe c tability . journals like [ wiki link : nature ( journal ) nature ] , [ wiki link : science ( journal ) science ] , [ wiki link : new england journal of medicine ] are examples of excellent sources . there is little doubt that claiming , as per omura bdort , that by trying to force open a patient 's fingers , the ' trained ' operative can diagnose and cure most illnesses known to man , is ' outlandish ' and extraordinary . hence there is little doubt that excellent sourcing is needed . now , if wp requires an excellent source , there is no room for end - runs . by saying : \" x published a paper y in publication z \" , we must first prove that x , y and z meet our excellent sourcing requirements , otherwise we can not make that statement inside an article . i believe that in this case we have serious doubts as to each of x , y and z , hence they are not admissible . if we were to accept this statement , wp 's excellent sourcing requirement for outlandish claims would be a mere decoration . : like i said earlier , this would be true if the citation were applied to talk about the efficacy of bdort . as i understand it , richard wants to use this citation to talk about the \" history \" of bdort that is , that shinnick claims to have tested it . in saying \" according to shinnick \" in the citation , rather than presenting it as neutral , this makes a mundane claim : that shinnick uses bdort . - as i noted earlier also , the mere fact that at least one person ( besides omura and colleagues ) used bdort at one point can be stated . the statement the richard wants to introduce , which essentially is a description of a paper and results which do n't meet wp 's ' excellent sourcing ' requirement , can not be included in the article . : but it certainly can be said that shinnick claims to have conducted this experiment , no ? shinnick is indeed an excellent source on what shinnick claims . something to the effect of \" shinnick claims that he is able to di ag no s tically apply the test to determine the internal cause of pain arising from acupuncture meridian phenomena \" ( to use richard 's words ) . - che : wp can not cite claims by anyone about extraordinary scientific topics unless they are excellent sources - recognized experts in their field and or highly c re den ti aled , publishing a peer - reviewed article in a reputable journal , etc . in this case shinnick , his paper and the publication do not meet those criteria , hence the paper and or \" shinnick 's claims \" ( which are one and the same here ) can not be used . : i think you 're confusing the concepts of claiming and quoting . we can not use shinnick to claim anything about bdort because shinnick is not such a stellar source on health and medicine . however , we can quote him on what he claims , because he 's a great source on what he claims . : take another analogous religious situation . the book of genesis is not really what you 'd call a good source on the creation of the universe , mainly because it 's not a verifiable source . we do n't even know when or by whom it was written . so we do n't quote b . of genesis in articles about geological history . we do , however , quote it ( indirectly ) in the article about [ wiki link : young earth creationism ] ( eg \" additionally , they believe that the biblical account of noah 's flood is historically true , maintaining that there was a worldwide flood ( circa bc ) that destroyed all terrestrial life except that which was saved on noah 's ark . \" ) . : that 's what this boils down to . exceptional evidence does n't mean that the source has to prove what it sets out to prove ; it means it has to prove what we use it to say . we ca n't say \" bdort has been successfully tested by shinnick \" , but we can say that \" shinnick claims to have successfully tested bdort \" , which is incontrovertible fact . - che : i beg to differ . if a published source is unacceptable , because it is of dubious quality and does not meet wp 's ' exceptional evidence ' requirements to support an exceptional claim , it can not be used , period . we ca n't re ha bi li tate the paper and author by saying \" author x claimed y in publication z \" - adding the weasel word ' claims ' does not magically bless the reference . the idea is that we keep the statement out of wp unless it is backed up by the proper evidence . the bible is different . the bible is either a fable or gospel truth , depending on your pov , but there are lots of excellent publications quoting it , so we may quote it too . there are no excellent publications at this time that quote shinnick 's work . crum , you again , extrapolate into hyperbole , and imply things that i am trying to present , that i have not . the article says what it says , nothing to do with \" illnesses known to man \" . the article says something very specific as can be read . re the excellent sourcing , ) what exact wp policy text are you referring to ? and ) che 's comments are correct , we are reporting what was done , said etc , historically , not claiming anything ; just like the extraordinary proof question , what you say really applies at all . : no , i 'm not saying we can report what was done ; we can report what shinnick claims was done . those are two very different things . che - : the wp policies i am referring to are [ wiki link : wp : v ] where it says : \" sources should also be appropriate to the claims made : outlandish claims require stronger sources \" and [ wiki link : wp : rs ] where it says : \" exceptional claims require exceptional evidence \" . and by claiming that \" bdort was able to detect the internal organ that was the causal factor of the pain \" , ju x ta posed with omura 's claims , as cited , about bdort di ag no sing curing just about all illnesses known to man , we are bol stering omura 's claims , using a source that does not meet wp 's \" exceptional evidence \" requirements . please note also my latest response to che above . : to clarify for che : there is no special wp provision that says that if some claim is outlandish and does not meet the required \" exceptional evidence \" , we are still allowed to use it with liberal sp rin kling of weasel words . in fact , the rules are quite opposite . : no , crum , sources are n't blanket - good or blanket - bad . sources are judged in relation to how they are used . that is the point of the bible example . the bible would be a terrible source for [ wiki link : geologic times cale ] and would be removed out of hand if it were inserted into that article , but it is an excellent source for [ wiki link : young earth creationism ] . david irving would be a terrible source for [ wiki link : action t ] , but he is an excellent source for [ wiki link : holocaust revisionism ] . : weasel words serve to make things more ambiguous . saying that shinnick claims something actually makes it more specific , because it identifies the people who believe these things . : it 's already been decided , via afd , that this subject is notable enough for an article . being as shinnick is among the only people to publish this kind of report , it makes him an excellent source on the belief in bdort . - crum , i think you are still confusing issues . i think it is as simple as that , in just the way the ' extraordinary proof ' argument does n't apply unless we are stating something as is . : in response to both of you , i agree with chet that sources come in all flavors . here we have a poor quality source to support anything scientific , for reasons discussed above . so if the issue is \" did anyone ever use bdort , besides gorringe and omura and his colleagues \" , then yes we can make state that shinnick used bdort . but to start describing his ' scientific study ' ( and i use quotation marks because we have no evidence he is qualified to design , perform or report on such a study ) , and his ' scientific conclusions ' or ' results ' ( again , quotes added for same reasons ) , would be contrary to the exceptional evidence requirements for an exceptional claim . : just in case there is any question about the need for exceptional evidence for shinnick 's claims , as i noted above , according to richard , shinnick claims : \" bdort was able to detect the internal organ that was the causal factor of the pain \" . relying on the subjective force required to open someone 's fingers to discover which internal organ is the causal factor of the pain , would be considered an exceptional or outlandish claim to most if not all mainstream scientists . in fact , there is no known reputable mainstream source on this planet that can support this claim . : i agree that a claim about the efficacy of bdort would be an exceptional claim . however , we 've already established what proponents of bdort believe it can do without the shinnick quotation , so the shinnick quotation does n't really make further claims . no \" description \" of the experiment is needed , nor any particulars about the results , but do n't you think the fact that he claims to have tested it is worth mentioning ? when people see an experiment that has not been repeated and not been used or cited by doctors , do n't you think they 'll come to the necessary conclusions ? - che : people may also reach the conclusion that wp is presenting scientific evidence from unqualified persons , published in dubious publications . for exceptional claims such as this one , we are only allowed to present scientific evidence from exceptionally high quality sources . if we present a claim from an unqualified person , in an unqualified publication with no proof of peer review , we are violating the exceptional sourcing requirement . if we couch the claims with weasel words such as \" claims this \" and \" claims that \" we are not improving the quality of the source in any way . either we have the sourcing we need and it stays , or we do n't and it goes . and to emphasize , just in case there is any doubt : the issue is not the ' truth ' or even ' scientific validity ' - wp is not equipped to judge either - the issue is strictly , as always , does the quality of the sourcing match the ex c ep tionality of the claim . we would report something even if all editors disagreed with it personally , as long as it 's properly sourced . a part of the inevitable difficulty in this process , or so it seems to me , is the simple fact that the ad miss ability of a source , characterized via the mechanism of wp criteria , is treated as a quasi - independent factor even though the parties concerned are , in fact , concerned with its particular application and implications for the balance of the entry as a whole . such a process tends to prove intractable when approached rec ur sively as opposed to syn the tically . if this source is not admitted , as crum would clearly seem to prefer , it leaves the matter of bdort 's application unverified other than claims of omura and his immediate circle . if , on the other hand , it is admitted , it would seem probable that richard , motivated of his sincere beliefs in the character of scientific method defined as he understands it , will attempt to naturally ' present it as implicit if not explicit evidence if not validation of bdort 's having been , to at least some degree , presented within a scientific ' or medical ' context within the common ( as opposed to alternative ' ) com pre hen sions of those terms . in that sense , it seems to me , the process is inverted and distorted in what seems a logical attempt to advance one step at a time , ' when , in fact , it is the outcome as to balance that is de ter min ative . in this sense the discussion is analogous to the ad mis si bility of evidence in a court a contest between combatants , with the only justice in the halls rather than within the hall of judgement . two scorpions having at one another as to terms of ad mis si bility are unlikely to arrive at an amicable or a truthful ' resolution . thus , in other contexts , the role of an editor , or judge , however imperfect . there is no analog of that function present in this process in my estimation , hence its limitations . the challenge for you , as ' believers ' in this process , is to prove the skeptics wrong . : well , mr . whiffle , as a firm ' believer ' in the wp concept , i ask you to look at the evidence . pick any controversial topic you want , and check the current snapshot status of its article . my own impression is that actually , given the fact that it 's all done by amateurs and volunteers , we are doing pretty good compared to any commercial professional encyclopedia dealing with the same hot topics . : well , now i 'm only a simple whiffle , so what would a whiffle know , but i would think that 's a fairly low standard pretty well for amateurs and volunteers . that aside , i would think you might want to consider very tightly linking discussion of potential ad mis si bility to tightly specific and constrained language and application within the entry . otherwise the sun may fade before this current recursive process reaches something resembling resolution . of course , that 's only a whiffle on my part , and wh i ffles do n't know much but if they wobble they do n't fall down ! ; - ) : i actually agreed with this earlier . i think that we can use the shinnick paper as evidence that someone besides omura and colleagues and gorringe , has actually used bdort on real patients . i asked che to suggest possible ( if any ) use for this in the article , as i am not sure myself . it would seem to me that if all are agreed that the reference is valid for that purpose and for that purpose alone that it might be a footnote citation to an en passant reference which indicates there is in fact usage . it need not include characterization of the extent of that usage . it would have , i would think , to be tightly constrained to that particular application unless evidence is found to bolster its application beyond that extent . if richard or someone else is able to find such evidence , fine . pending that development , however , it seems to me it must be very tightly constrained so as to demonstrate what it does in fact demonstrate while not implying more than that . that 's how it seems to one whiffle , anyway . : richard ? - che ) whiffle , can you first please answer the simple question , are you the same person who used the arc sin co stan handle or anything similar at any time in the past ? that is a perfectly reasonable question to ask , i think everyone will agree , and i object to your involvment if you do not answer this question . i think wp has a name for people using multiple handles . : whiffle is whiffle . whiffle is not using multiple handles . try and pay attention . ) i agree with crum that i think that we can use the shinnick paper as evidence that someone besides omura and colleagues and gorringe , has actually used bdort on real patients , but i see no wp reason yet mentioned re the above discussion why we can not say how it was used . f ru m , you repeat the confusion , which sounds good but does not stand up , that we are not presenting factual information re a judgement on the bdort but what some people who used it say about it concluded etc . and that is fine . your concern what the public might believe or not , which flows from your implicitly stated bias that che also recognized immediately on reading what you wrote to addhoc , to warn the public about your perceived dangers of the bdort , which is again creeping in here , is not appropriate to wp as many people have told you previously ( eg when you wanted a line at the end of each para etc ) . i have told you before that if we followed your logic , every entry in every encyclopedia , in all of the world , that ever even mentioned an invention tool etc and that did not carry a public warning ( which they dont ) would ( in your eyes ) be a danger and all such encyclopedias would have to burned immediately for the ' public good ' . we can use this source to say who used it , what they did ( in summary ; giving some details of what they did is not against wp policies neither a global public threat ) , and what they concluded . and as che says , the reader can obviously see if they care to look that this is an isolated study cited ( ie not cross referenced ) and can decide for themselves how much validity to give to it , ; much rather than you , ' crum ' doing this for them , which is your intention according to your words , but not your role as an editor here . as che says , its an excellent ( third party ) source for saying what shinnick thinks about the bdort . and what he et al did and found according to them is not a wp crime either . re the scientific bit , just as i will not allow you to use the word as a descriptive unless the sub je tc referred to is scientific ( ie not just opinion viz the nz trib uni al which was not on the bdort anyway ) , you will note that i have not argued here to label this study by shinnick scientific , just to present in neu tr aly . : this is vague . suggest wording and employment in the entry . the core problem is an utter lack of specificity . whiffle , pay attention please ; - ) because based on what i have written just above and so far anyone could suggest the wording ; why dont you give it a go ; and constructively add to the discussion here . you are the one who wants shinnick , but you want other people to word it for you . should they pull their fingers apart to read your mind ? whiffle has just pulled his fingers apart ! ( the left index finger won ! ) the left index finger says that this reference is not sufficiently reliable or reputable ! no one knows who shinnick is except shinnick ! no one knows what this journal is except this journal ! this is what ter r ans call a circle jerk ! circle jerks are when people stand in a circle and pull fingers while making peculiar expressions . it is an ancient ter r an custom , whiffle has been told . circle jerks seem to be important to the people in the circle but no one else knows what they mean . meaningless is bad . pull your fingers and see if you can find a reputable source . thank you for playing wikipedia ! richard , you keep referring to my perceived bias as if it is some kind of crime . wp recognizes that every editor has a bias , we would n't be human otherwise . some have clear biases - like you earning money from bdort and obviously wanting to protect its reputation , and me wanting wp to meet its stated goals of verification and neutrality . i see no problem with our admitting those biases , in fact it may help us progress quicker . as far as adding the balancing statements near each place we state one of omura 's claims , we will get to that in due time - this mediation is supposed to cover all issues , and this is certainly one of them , but now or here in the ' shinnick ' section . regarding possible usage of the shinnick paper - i myself am not sure how to use it . we certainly ca n't ' describe the paper and let the reader decide ' - that 's a backdoor way to including the paper , and thereby providing a shaky source for an outlandish claim - violating wp 's policies . we could , in principle , use it as evidence that we know of at least one person that has used bdort besides omura and colleagues who has n't been punished ( to our knowledge ) , but i am not sure if that 's ' encyclopedic ' . so i am waiting for you and che ( or mr . whiffle ? ) to suggest how to handle it . this is agreed as at best a dubious limited source by wp criteria . what , precisely is its purpose ? how , precisely is it suggested it be employed ? the problem , crum , is the bias that is not declared ( by you ) , that che recognized as your opinion on the bdort immediately you implied it when you did . i dont know what to say to you other than what has been said to you repeatedly before that you are confusing applications of wp policies , claims , and plain re pr ting of facts ; and ignoring points made to you that you dont seem to hear . che , can i ask you to do as the previous mediator did , and based on discussion here , draft what you think we can write about the shinnick case ? to my mind i have already done this so dont want to repeat needlessly . thank you . richard , do you prefer to discuss motivation or present the fashion in which you think shinnick might validly be employed ? whiffle would like to propose , after richard has pulled his fingers apart to determine his criteria for ad mis si bility and presentation and duly presented them , which i am certain will happen [ looks up at extensive verbiage preceding ] real soon now ( to employ a technical term ) that at a later date , after the sun has gone nova and rendered this discussion even more effectively moot ( if possible ) than in its present form that the assembled merry pr an k sters weigh at great length the possibility of re - ter ming bdort ( bi - digital o - ring test ) as the cj t ( circle jerk test ) alternatives might be the oc jt ( omura circle jerk test ) , or the ok no tok test since the test involves the ability of an american - style ' ok ' sign to maintain its integrity i 'm ok meaning healthy and no tok meaning will die soon . these alternate terms would be much simpler and less confusing than the bdort terminology which suggests the sound of someone vomiting , which whiffle , at least , finds non - de cor ous and thus in violation of widely known but sporadically invoked unwritten wikipedia official policy such as that invoked on whiffle 's talk page by hostile and easily offended administrators of victorian - lady - caricature - like sensibilities . whiffle thinks this is a wp : ok idea , and people should circle jerk their fingers to evaluate its validity according to unwritten wikipedia policy ! : che , it sounds like richard believes at present that his suggested wording above for the use of the shinnick paper is the best he can come up with . it sounds to me like you disagree with richard 's proposal or wording , and i obviously disagree too . i think mr . whiffle also disagrees , if we count his whiffle - vote . imo , it makes sense for you as mediator to try to suggest the best course of action , given the above situation , so we can pursue the matter further . thanks , : well , now that this horse has been beaten , buried , dug up , burned , beaten again , and cha ined to an anchor and thrown overboard . : i 'm not convinced that saying that shinnick claims to have tested the method actually adds anything to the article which saying that he uses it does not . of course he believes that he can successfully use it , otherwise he would n't use it . whether citing the test itself from this article is dis ingen ous or not is , in my opinion , a far more complicated question than either of you seems to think , but hey , nothing says you have to agree with me , and i do n't claim to know i 'm right . : something akin to \" shinnick claims to be able to reproduce omura 's result , and uses bdort in his practice of chinese medicine \" would , i think , be relatively innocuous and , quite honestly , convey everything that there is to be taken from this article . : thoughts ? - : well , shinnick is a non - notable person ( wp - wise ) and is not c re den ti alled qualified ( wp - wise ) to design perform report a medical study that claims exceptional results ( e . g . that by forcing open a patient 's fingers and subjectively testing the patient 's strength he can tell which internal organ is the cause of pain ) . thus his claims as to what he thinks about bdort are not admissible , imo . if shinnick 's paper were cited by some credible mainstream publication , maybe then we could refer to shinnick and his claims beliefs . otherwise , i do n't think the claims beliefs of a non - notable person who is scientifically unqualified to make those claims ( again wp - wise ) should be cited in a wp article . also , for all we know , maybe shinnick only pe formed the study described in his paper and never used bdort again ( maybe he is concerned he could be fined stripped like gorringe ) , so i am not sure we really know more than he just once used it . thus your suggested statement that says he is using it today is more than we really know , and even if he does use it , we do n't know that he only uses it for chinese medicine . whiffle , are you the same person that has previously used the name arc sin co stan , or any other similar handle , or ever participated here under another name ? i am whiffle . you are not whiffle . who are you ? if you pull your fingers apart while holding them tight can you tell who you are ? i think you are dr . yoshiaki omura ch ann eling through australia . who do you think you are ?

( - ) : re \" typographical device such as an apostrophe or a serial comma is worthy of an entry , why not sic and stet \" - of all your points sn al wi bma , i find the most resonance w this one . i 'm still for getting an rfc started for this question . : i agree that stet would also be subject to the same treatment ( as would other ' definition only ' words ) . as for words as entries , the policy is clear that simple definitions belong at wiktionary , not here . the whole question is around words , so i think your point about punctuation is a bit nonsensical - especially about making up a symbol - this clearly fails notability , verifiability etc . with stet , the use as a symbol has more relevance for encyclopaedic content . and once more , i feel at pains to point out , that this is just moving an article to a more appropriate place - wp does n't actually ' lose ' the content . : i 'm not against an rfc for this , although i think the key question should not be about opinion , but rather whether ( a ) the article as it stands is purely dictionary material and ( b ) whether it could ever be anything more than that . this is not the place to be arguing the policy , which should be done at the talk for [ wiki link : wp : not ] so we should stick to facts about whether or not this is a dictionary article ow ain davies ( ) edited at conclusion : : in light of 's excellent work on this article , i think we can call the conversation above no longer relevant . would anyone disagree ? : i think you 're right - though ( a ) it is too verbose and repetitive , ( b ) i strongly dislike the phrase \" the bracketed sic \" that now appears p assi m , and ( c ) i can not see the point in the note at the top saying that the \" correct \" title of the article is [ sic ] . i will tackle these issues . ( - ) : k sn al wi bma . glad we came to an agreeable conclusion here . enjoyed discussing this with you . i think ought to get a barnstar for some good work here . : thanks for the thought of giving me a barnstar , nick ct ) as for sn al 's dislike for the term \" bracketed sic , \" i must disagree with you a bit as the main subject of this article is not the word , but the bracketed sic and its usage . nonetheless , perhaps we can compromise , rather than the phrase \" the usage of sic \" , which is a bit ambiguous , let 's just say \" sic cing \" which is perfectly valid . after all , the oxford english dictionary does have the following entry : \" sic v . , to mark with a sic ' . \" meaning : english or latin ? does it really mean \" intentionally so written \" ? in latin it means \" so \" , \" thus , \" \" as such , \" or \" in such a manner \" ; there is no reference specifically to writing nad all the standard latin translations given above are sufficient to am ke the meaning clear . and also - not all transcriptions errors that warrant a [ sic ] are intentional , surely - such as the typo where the writer unintentionally types the letters in the wrong order , knowing full well the proper spelling ( eg \" teh \" for \" the \" ) . * it does mean \" intentionally so written \" according to the [ external link : miriam - webster english dictionary ] . whether it is or is not an english word is debatable , but there 's no governing body that dictates what is an english word and what is not . it 's really a matter of opinion . both sides have valid reasons . those who argue it is latin may argue that it is seldom used outside of copy - editing . those who say it is not latin anymore may point out that the romans would have never used thought of using the word to note in ten tionality in printing , therefore it now has a distinct modern meaning that the original latin never fully carried . moreover , the oxford english dictionary does list sic as a verb meaning \" to mark with a sic ' . bom bas tic and pro li x at the outset this is what i mean about wikipedia 's amateur writers sounding far more ab str use than the professionals . is a comment interpol ated into quoted or reprinted material to indicate that the preceding text has been reproduced liter ati m from the source , so as to avoid the mis attribution of textual irregularities to transcription errors by the quo ter or re printer . a bracketed sic may also be used as a form of ridicule or as a humorous comment . and this tongue and brain twister does not even tell you what sic means ! now how about ? : is a latin word which means \" as is \" or \" just as it is \" , and is placed after some quoted text , in brackets , to indicate that this text has been reproduced just as it is from the source . the editor 's intention is to inform readers that any errors or such in the quote are not those of the editor but those of the original writer . a bracketed sic may also be used as a form of ridicule or as a humorous comment , typically by drawing attention to the original writer 's mistakes . this explains it all succinctly and does not require the reader to look up liter ati m . it also avoids mis attribution and inter po late , neither term being needed here . i 'm putting this up for some comments , and , if they are favourable , i will \" inter po late \" the text into the corpus of the opus . : [ wiki link : wp : bold be bold ] . your text seems quite reasonable . - : thanks , i 've done that . subject : the bracketed sic , not : the word sic * my les , thanks , but alas , the new lead is written like a dictionary entry , which goes against the editing policy [ wiki link : wp : dictionary handling problems wp : dictionary ] . as noted in the part i 've linked , the intro should describe what the thing is rather than what is the word 's definition , i . e . \" a dog is an animal \" is preferred over \" dog is a term for an animal . \" moreover , this article is not about sic , but the bracketed sic . : the lead used to read as \" the bracketed sic generally [ sic ] and sometimes ( sic ) is a type of bracketed comment . \" however , it seems that two edits ended up making the intro to be unclear : first , someone removed { [ wiki link : template : bracketed ] } , thinking it unnecessary . second , another editor removed the word bracketed from the lead because they did n't realize , not seeing the template , that such was the correct title of the article . nonetheless , you 're right that the intro could have been written simpler . i 'll fix the issues shortly . : i strongly disagree . the subject of the article is the word sic and how it is used . that is quite enough to take it beyond [ wiki link : wp : dicdef ] . besides , \" the bracketed sic \" is an ugly and pointless phrase . and in the opening sentence , it is not \" the bracketed sic \" but simply \" sic \" that is a \" bracketed comment \" - i . e . it 's only \" sic \" that is in the brackets . i have reverted to the cleaner version . ( - ) : my le sa back live here . the current version of the opening paragraph is an improvement on my amend ation of recent days . thanks , sn al wi bma . code hydro , i can sort of see your point about \" sic \" and \" the bracketed sic \" but i think it is impossibly pedantic . sic nearly always appears in brackets when it is being used as a tool , and only without them when it is the topic of some text , as it is here in this sentence . : further , i have elsewhere in this talk page ( see \" brackets \" above ) made some attempt to discriminate when the round brackets and when the square ones should be used , especially in serious writing . it is true that in non - serious writing , they are often inter changed . the article makes a preliminary attempt to make this distinction , but not in a thorough way . wikipedia is not a prescriptive manual on writing protocols , but on the other hand , people who look things like sic up are often after some information on how it is employed in recognised english usage . it is our job to give lay readers that information , in a clear and succinct way that is suitable for a \" people 's encyclopedia \" . : actually , sn al , you 're right that we can omitted the adjective bracketed when talking about sics . in fact , looking at the oxford dictionary , sic is also a noun that refers to \" n . , an instance of sic ' . \" in light of that , we do not need to italicize the word sic where we are not talking about the word , but rather about instances when people mark texts with sics . : and my les , just letting you know that i have removed the latin meaning from the intro because it was making the sentence too long and that latin is already briefly mentioned in the second paragraph of the intro ; moreover , people do n't actually need to know the latin meaning in order to use sic properly . it 's interesting info , but that detail is adequately covered in the etymology history section in my opinion . by the way , i increased the indent for your above comment . : i like the way this is going - good material from the oed added ! just one query - how does the fact that sic can be a noun as well as an adjective affect whether it is italicised in the article ? surely that depends on the [ wiki link : use - mention distinction ] , and there is a good case for using italics whenever the word is referred to but not actually used i . e . almost every time it appears in this article . - sorry , i now realise . strike that\n",

( [ external link : ] ) : i am aware that the screenshots refer to the text , but the text does not refer to the screenshots . to have such a loose interpretation of the fair use guidelines is to completely ignore the context under which copyrighted media was originally allowed on wikipedia , and the underlying principle is \" as a last resort \" . : \" . no free equivalent is available or could be created that would adequately give the same information . \" the free alternative of using no images adequately gives the same information about the episode . for example , next to the description of \" everybody hates hugo \" , what does one learn from seeing a picture of hugo talking to jack on the beach that is so import nat it ne ces sit ates the use of a copyrighted image ? : if you 're going to continue on this crusade , i already gave you four other episode lists .

( [ external link : ] ) : i refer you to my previous comments . : as i said , i find the reasons you stated above to be insufficient . you are taking an extreme pov of this policy , and as a result a perfectly good list is turning into crap . i believe these images can be used given the fair use criteria , and it looks like there 's about a dozen other people here who think the same . what makes your views more correct than our views ?

      "add * support or * oppose followed by an optional one - sentence explanation , then sign your opinion with support move . the american city was named after the famous city of syracuse , now in italy . it was an important city in the history of europe for almost years . support . being italian , i may be judged a bit prejudiced ; but honestly , i believe the sicilian city is by far the most famous of the two . support [ wiki link : syracuse ] is far more important and notable than [ wiki link : syracuse , new york ] , for the reasons i have outlined above . - support simply on seniority , not on importance notability . of course , a disambig note on the top is a must . : comment i really do n't follow that logic . pursuant to that tenet , should n't [ wiki link : elizabeth of portugal queen elizabeth of portugal ] be granted [ wiki link : queen elizabeth ] based on seniority ? \" seniority \" , as you call it , should only add to notability , and notability should be the only factor in disambiguation disputes . now what we have here is a competition that is too close to call . : not a good analogy . a better analogy would be [ wiki link : cleopatra ] . : respectfully , bogdan , the fact that syracuse , new york was named after syracuse , italy is entirely irrelevant and is a matter of trivia . many towns in the region are named after mediterranean cities ( utica , ith aca , etc . ) other than their names they are completely unrelated . i do , however , like the second analogy . i would like to say this one more time so people read it . syracuse , new york is larger than syracuse , italy , and more than twice as many wikipedia articles link to it . : the founded cities were named after ancient cities , because many of your early leaders were people with a good [ wiki link : classical education ] . - ) : adam , as far as your royalty analogy goes : i think it should be [ wiki link : elizabeth windsor ] really , but that 's just me . as far as seniority goes , it probably was n't the best term , but i hope i got my message across : since naming convention is simply about names , it 's only logical to use syracuse for the town originally named that way . also , syracuse existed since th century b . c . e , way before there was italy per se , syracuse in north america ( one of several at least ) is much more tied to usa . support - if this must be an international encyclopedia , we must think outside the us borders , and the opposers , casually ? , are all from us and probably live in syracuse , ny . and are you sure that a thai lan de se or bur kina fas o user will ever check syracuse new york ? syracuse italy is on every decent book of history . : comment i definitely understand your historic significance argument . however , just as the italian one might be \" in every history book , \" the new york one has the edge on modern significance ( nearly every listing on google ) . - : i repeat it . number of go og les click must have ( almost ) nothing to do with what we must write here . if this was entirely true , we should devote of space to porn entries . : i agree about google hits . but this debate is damaging . it just adds to the europe - usa rift that wastes a huge amount of time on wp . why not just say both sy rac uses are important , and use the tried and true disambiguation solution ? this feels like a \" my syracuse is more important that yours ! \" argument . do we need this ? - : ( utc ) : i think there would have been no problem . it 's a matter of understanding what we are doing here . in a cultural encyclopedia , i ca n't believe that really exist people stressing that syracuse ny can have pre - eminence , or even equal status , over syracuse , italy . it 's a matter of obvious way to look at culture from a higher point of view . i 've nothing against usa of in favour of europe , and i would never say that [ wiki link : new york ] is less important than [ wiki link : syracuse , italy ] ! i think the problem is that in this encyclopedia is too largely anglo - saxon biased : want to speak of us , uk , can , aus users , often of zero cultural background , write tons of info for wrestling , baseball , tv or pop music stars ( by the way , often even forgetting to specify they are referring to us or uk . ) , when entries which should have far more space in a true encyclopedia lay abandoned in the stub limbo ( this is one of the point we must overcome if we want to check britannica 's quality one day . ) ? ciao ! support - i come across this sort of thing in wikipedia all the time . if something has existed for , years ( often at the heart of a variety of western and eastern cultures ) , it might be of marginal interest , if it has any connection with the usa for minutes - well , shut the gate , hold me back , obviously that must be significant ! - [ wiki link : scn : user talk : p ip pu d' angelo ( wa ar om ? jus ' b ' coz ! ) ] support - i am born in switzerland , but i never heard about syracuse , ny until my graduate studies . i think that all of you agree that on average , if you ask a non - american , he probably knows syracuse in sicily rather than syracuse ny . support - the italian city was originally at syracuse anyway , and was moved by someone from the one in new york . i tried to argue against it at the time but he was n't listening . : nor was i this time ) - : oh , that was you ) support . maybe i 'm hopelessly euro - centric , but i would personally never expect the unqualified name to refer to anything other than the italian place . support , syracuse in sicily is far more notable and important than the one in new york . google hits are skewed because americans dominate the web , and syracuse is n't an english location . it 's also the source of the name for syracuse new york . support this is a wiki , with historical articles . in that context , the italian , and greek , syracuse has greater interest and more links . : note to editors : please use logic . ) : your second sentence is being debated below . syracuse , ny has both more links on wikipedia and elsewhere ) - support . unqualified , syracuse ought to always refer to the original syracuse . this is understood . the argument from the number of links is a strong one , but syracuse , ny , has always been syracuse , ny . syracuse , italy however makes little sense . the original syracuse was not considered a part of italy ( it was n't ) and any reference to syracuse unqualified must refer to the original syracuse which tran sc en ds modern poli ties and therefore needs no qualification . if [ wiki link : london , ontario ] ever exceeds [ wiki link : london , england ] in population , the latter will still have the benefit of first name recognition : it is london , the canadian city is just named after it . : \" this is understood \" ? by whom ? if you do not agree with the italy part , change it to sicily . if more generally , you do not agree with the specificity , than change the wikipedia guidelines , because place names must be specific . the question is not \" is the italian city more important , \" the question is \" is the american city unimportant . \" over and over again i hear the examples of london , or rome . lets face it , s , it is no london england or rome italy , and s , ny is no london , ontario or rome , ny ; if you need to cite such extremes to support your idea , it shows that you neither believe it , nor do you want me to . support . as per . it 's like prefer ing [ wiki link : athens , georgia ] over the original [ wiki link : athens ] . : no it is nothing like comp airing athens george a to the or ri gin al . see that ? i used just as much evidence to su port my claim as you . - : , the problem here is really one of contexts . perhaps in some contexts syracuse could refer to the new york municipality when unqualified , but in historical contexts , never . in literary contexts , never . the title of an encyclopaedia article , however , has no other context than that it is an encyclopaedia article . this said , what is more encyclopaedic ? the original syracuse , since it is not insignificant ( as evidenced by the fact that it has cities named after it ) , is the best candidate for the page syracuse . the new york city would only be called syracuse unqualified by a very sloppy individual with a limited education , unless the context warranted it . i am not going to call you uneducated or un read , because i do n't know if you are , but to ask why \" this is understood \" and by whom indicates what you do not read . as i would have hoped you knew ( and still hope ) , educated writers will regularly refer simply to people like alexander and dr johnson , seemingly ignoring the fact that there are many alex and ers and drs johnson . but the figures being referred to are simply \" understood . \" syracuse is city with a history of importance which makes the minor american municipality pale in comparison ( on a truly global , historical scale ) . : similarly , i will not call you sloppy , or unintelligent because you have either not taken the time to read the arguments on the page , or did not understand them . i assure you that i am neither . your points that in a literary and historical sense s , it is more well known are well taken , and i fully agree with you . in what context then is syracuse , ny more notable ? in the context of wikipedia . syracuse , ny is searched more often , and is linked to more often that syracuse , italy . plus , as you neglected to notice , no one is saying that syracuse , ny ought to take sole position of the syracuse page . we arguing that the syracuse page should remain as it has been for two years , that is , as a disambiguation page . clearly in literary and historical circles , syracuse means italy , not ny , yet more people still seem to visit the syracuse , ny page . until that changes there is clearly ambiguity , and where there is ambiguity , we should provide disambiguation . : i have read the arguments . i chose only to address those raised in direct argumentation with me . wikipedia is not its own context . this is an encyclopaedia , i 'm sure there are some star wars articles that get more hits than far more important articles , but that is no case to concentrate on star wars articles . what pages people visit have no bearing here . there will be disambiguation , but at [ wiki link : syracuse ( disambiguation ) ] . it seems mighty silly to have to link to [ wiki link : syracuse , italy ] when discussing the ancient greek presence on sicily . linking to [ wiki link : syracuse , new york ] every time , however , is sensible . i do not have a strong objection to the current state of things . but having spent time writing articles where i link to syracuse , it seemed silly to have to dab those links because of some american municipality which far less historical significance . : so you favor your usage over the majority 's usage of wikipedia ? yes , s , ny is of less historical sign i fi gence than s , it , i can see how then s , ny would be of little sign i fig ance to a classical historian . yet , s , ny remains of more sign i fig ance to wikipedia users in general . three times as many pages link to s , ny than to s , it . i can see that this is difficult to realize from your ivory tower , as you can not offer any empirical evidence to support yourself . is it a fact that \" pygmalion \" is more notable than \" my fair lady ? \" is bee to van 's \" ode to joy \" more important than armstrong 's \" what a wonderful world \" ? its not as simple as people 's comp ai ris ons have been . until this site becomes wiki history , you 'll just have to understand that other people use this encyclopedia . : what you call \" majority usage \" is irrelevant . as i said , i 'm sure there are more people searching for che w b acc a than charlemagne , but that does n't mean the one is more important for the encyclopaedia . indeed , it is less so . if somebody links to [ wiki link : syracuse ] without disambiguation , they ought to know that will not get them to [ wiki link : syracuse , new york ] . however , it is not true that somebody linking to [ wiki link : syracuse ] should know that it wo n't go to [ wiki link : syracuse , italy ] . i do n't live or frequent ivory towers , but yes , in fact , beethoven 's \" ode to joy \" is more important than armstrong 's \" what a wonderful world \" . if you would like to know why , please ask . i apologise if my initial remarks were perhaps condescending ( that was not the intention ) , but i hope to convince you through honest argumentation . if you still do n't see my point , let 's try again . there is more to a city than its population and how often wiki articles link to it . : the majority usage is not irrelevant , however , your star wars references are . s , ny is not fictional , nor are s , ny 's achievements limited to a f le eting existence in pop culture . again , i understand your argument , and i still find it lacking . perhaps you should n't explain the argument anymore , but rather support it . when people search wikipedia , they do n't do it in the traditional way that they would search an encyclopedia , they search by terms . so , a perfectly educated person may type in \" syracuse \" without disambiguation and expect to find s , ny . population , wikilinks , and you forgot to mention number of visits and google hits indeed are not everything , because if they were , the page would belong to s , ny alone seeing as it wins in a landslide in each instance ( except population ) . a city founded in the common era can be more encyclopedic than woo kies , nor does it need a famous mathematician running naked through it streets to be notable . clearly both cities have arguments for and against them , which is why they need to stay disambiguated , its only reasonable . : if a perfectly educated person typed in sy rac ues expecting to find sy rac ues , new york , i 'm shocked . somebody perfectly educated may , if they live in new york , sometimes forget that the nearby syracuse is not the more famous one , but then they would understand why they did n't end up at syracuse , ny , but syracuse , italy . by moving [ wiki link : sy rac ues , italy ] to [ wiki link : syracuse ] , we 're just being accurate , leaving [ wiki link : syracuse , new york ] where it belongs . but the original syracuse is famously associated with many states besides italy and deserves not to need disambiguation just because some people ( mostly probably new yor kers or at least american who do n't know too much about history ) forget there is an older , more significant syracuse . support . this solution is better . - support the city is invariably called plain syracuse in the classics so syracuse , italy is confusing . a god disambig header on top should take care of people looking for the town in ny or the university . oppose move syracuse , italy may well be more notable , but it is smaller and it does not surpass syracuse , ny in notability enough to be exempt from disambiguation . also , more than twice as many pages link to syracuse , ny . oppose while the city in italy is unquestionably the ' original ' , it seems that many , if not most readers , would be looking for info about either the new york city or the university in new york . i ran a google search and of top hits ( ) were for syracuse , ny and or the university there . this clearly seems to be a case where disambig is appropriate and necessary . oppose . to make this encyclopedia truly international , and to reflect the importance of both sy rac uses , there should be a disambiguation page at syracuse . like i have said before , and similar to above , this is no rome , italy vs . rome , new york or vienna , austria vs . vienna , virginia . syracuse , new york is the major urban center of a three - quarter million people metropolitan area , and over a million people [ wiki link : central new york ] region . as above , this article is highly visited , highly linked , etc . there 's a couple more reasons in the discussion above , so i think i have justified myself ! - oppose . this is like the georgia question : both are important . it is simply divisive to try to argue about degrees of \" important - ness \" . the disambiguation page solution is best in cases like this . - : ( utc ) oppose . even if i 'm sicilian , i think a disambiguation page would be better . in my opinion , there 's not enough difference of notability between syracuse , italy and syracuse , ny . strongly oppose . this has gotten a little rediculous . i have seen new kai make countless objective arguments only to be rebuffed with ignorance on the other side . i did not see one objective fact used by the syracuse italy crowd . google hits ? wiki page with t he most traffic ? anything ? the main arguments i read , in fact , had more to do with distaste for american ego tism than anything objective . : a test may be objective but inappropriate . google hits are inappropriate for this particular task , as they vary depending on country . traffic statistics per page are not kept anymore . should i understand by your comment that you are supporting american ego tism ? i suggest you look at reliable sources , such as journals , other encyclopaedias , books etc . to see which has the greatest amount of notability . i repeat , google is a poor indicator of notability , as our very own policy page states . - : google is very appropriate in this situation . what comes up when one searches \" florence \" ? florence , ital y not florence , california . this is only representative of the english - speaking world , but we can not cast it aside as nonsense . if of the top google results relate to ny , then that is a strong point in our favor . also , i 'm guessing what he meant by site traffic is \" what links here \" . in that case , s , ny has more than twice as many links ( ) . all i can do is repeat what i 've already said to try to free others from their romantic ised fon dness for syracuse , italy . let 's be fair . : no google is not appropriate to this situation . please try not to be condescending ! ) as i said above , i suggest you check reliable sources such as journals , encyclopaedias , books etc . - : even italy 's google page does not give si ric usa italy a lead in google hits . surely th uc y di des mention 's the sicilian city more , however , until i see a fact showing that syracuse is associated overwhelming more with sicily than new york , i will continue to be seriously disappointed with your arguements . despite the previous comments i have read of your 's mr . ty ers , i suspect you have more sense than to beleive that i am in support of american ego tism , so i will ignore that comment . american ego tism has no more place in this discus sian than european elitism . lets say for instance i have been swayed by all of the arguments the sicily crowd has made . should i also be persuaded to switch the boston page to boston england , which also has a longer history , smaller population , and fewer google hits than its american counterpart ? : boston , ma is more important from a historical point of view , and i think i would argue that it should be at [ wiki link : boston ] . regardless of which language you search in the results are tailored to location . - : i did originally try google . com and google . it and got the same results . unless it cat ers to my ip . in that case . i 'm in vienna , austria . in any case , it 's impossible to tell for most languages other than english , because they generally spell the two cities differently . - : again this story of google hits ? i repeat it , are we working to a internet service or an encyclopedia ? : google is a good , but not fail proof suggestion of an entity 's notability . see [ wiki link : wp : go og ] . : si rac usa on google . it gives m hits : syracuse on google . it gives m hits . the first of which are almost exclusively syracuse , ny . : syracuse , ny on google . it gives m hits : si rac usa , italia on google . com gives about m hits . : as far as i can see syracuse , ny wins in every fair match up . google may be an imperfect tool , but it is certainly better than bri tan ica , and i have yet to see anything else offered in response . the results may or may not be skewed because more american 's may or may not use the internet , but if thats what people are looking for should n't we give them what they want ? to paraphrase atti lios , are we telling people what we want them to know or what they want to know ? : why did n't you answer to my question ? again , i repeat that measuring the relevance of a site from go og les entries does not minimally influence the size and pre - eminence of its article in an encyclopedia . can you understand that we are writing an encyclopedia ? if you try , you 'll see that [ wiki link : taj mahal ] has less google references than [ wiki link : syracuse , new york ] . do you really think that , from this basis , an encyclopedia must pay more attention to the latter ? wan na speak of [ wiki link : michael jackson ] or [ wiki link : robbie williams ] ? do you really think that an encyclopedia can gain more respect and credibility devoting to these figures more space than syracuse , italy , simply because they have more google ? it makes me laugh ! ( a note : all this said , your calculus can also be wrong simply because the italian syracuse appears in numerous websites as si rac usa ! ) : i think that we are writing is far more than a cultural encyclopedia , its an encyclopedia of all knowledge . to use google as a guide is not to turn wikipedia into a search engine , but it is basing wikipedia on what people want to know , not what we want to tell them . who is to decide what knowledge is more important , the few who write , or than many who read . i 'm sure britannica 's editorial board would insist upon the former , though i assure you the latter is more inline with wikipedia 's raison d' etre . if this decision were being made solely on the basis of google hits , syracuse ny would occupy the syracuse page , and syracuse italy would be a link . but we do pay attention to the value of knowledge . as important as si rac usa has been in history ( though certainly it has not been as important as other cities such as athens , rome or even the bes ) , i just can not see how it warrants completely taking over the page . i am not some red - state bush voting ru be . i love classical history , my middle name is literally achilles , and i plan on passing this down to my own children ( who i hope to name hector , helen and achilles ) . i am also a pr ag ma tist , google may not be completely objective , but i have seen nothing on these pages that approaches it . : exactly . where 's the culture in [ wiki link : list of north american area codes ] ! ? - : no , michael jackson is n't more important on wikipedia than [ wiki link : taj mahal ] , but he 'd be more important than another man named michael jackson who might get some fame tomorrow for something . and google would reflect this . once this new michael jackson achieved the same amount of google hits , then we might have an argument . in regards to the calculus , n iro tried si rac usa as noted above . - * comment : - despite calls for logic and reason this appears to be de generating into a debate about primacy . primacy , or pre - eminence , is not the issue here . there is clearly more than one notable city with the name syracuse . this is clearly a valid reason to have a disambig page under the main heading of that name which provides links to all the possible articles it references . which city is \" more notable \" is a straw - man argument , it distracts from the leg im ate asser tation of mutual notability . : agreed , the burden of proof is on the sicily side . they must prove not that they are more notable , but that syracuse , ny , a metropolitan area of over million people , a large notable university , and an important role in us history is notable . this has not been done . : never said that syracuse , ny is notable . i 'm sure here this has never been hinted . please avoid this vic tim ism which usually comes out when there are few reasons to bring in . : i assure you that no one is playing the victim . the only victim here is reason . if s , ny is more notable by some measures than s , it , than they deserve a disambiguation page . s , ny is un e qu i v ably searched more . i have heard excuses for this , \" michael jackson is a pedo e file \" , \" americans dominate the internet \" , \" people only search the internet for porn \" , but not one of these counters the argument . google is n't perfect , but that is why we give s , it the benefit of a doubt and give it a disambiguation page . you can argue until you are blue in the face about the cultural importance of s , it , but more people care about s , ny , and until there is no ambiguity , there must be disambiguation . strong oppose to having the aricle on syracuse , italy at [ wiki link : syracuse ] . while it is clear that [ wiki link : syracuse , new york ] is the most likely one to be searched for today , however that is not the only factor to consider . a redirect should not send someone to the wrong article a significant percentage of times . this confusing nomination would appear to do just that . there is no case for not having [ wiki link : syracuse ] as a dab page . this discussion is so far centered on two articles , syracuse has over articles already with different names . do n't forget [ wiki link : syracuse university ] which would be the suggested redirect from the sports fans or [ wiki link : syracuse problem ] for the math nuts . strongly oppose . neither syracuse , new york or syracuse , italy is dominant over the other . to not have a disambiguation page would be a disservice to wikipedia users . to summarize things to date : in favour of syracuse , it the most respectable encyclopedia in english world , britannica , de votes more space to syracuse , italy . syracuse , italy , is known by historians in the whole world . syracuse , ny , is famous only in the united states . the poll is currently vs . in favour of [ wiki link : syracuse , italy ] moved to [ wiki link : syracuse ] , despite syracuse , italy is in an english - speaking country [ wiki link : car av aggio ] worked here it is an [ wiki link : unesco world heritage site ] in favour of syracuse , new york google has more entries for syracuse , new york . added by new kai : larger city and metropolitan are a added by new kai : those historians that know syracuse , italy probably work at [ wiki link : maxwell school of citizenship and public affairs ] ( what i mean to say , large research university ) added by [ user : atti lios atti lios ] : this looks obscure and somewhat sarcastic for me . added by new kai : more wiki linksi have said this before too . i am not saying syracuse , new york is more important in the world than syracuse , italy . i 'm just saying it is important enough ( today . i 'm not saying ancient greek times here ) that there should be equal disambiguation . - : you 're bringing irrelevant arguments : the number of wikilinks is influenced by articles of highways ( [ wiki link : new york state route ] . ) and templates ( [ wiki link : template : new york ] ) . it is known that there are more articles on united states topics than on southern italy topics . : this also appears to apply to the entire internet . - : the entire internet is largely us - ruled . us are the richer , mos tech ono logically advanced and most powerful country in the world . and the english wikipedia is mostly written by us editors : you can find a lot articles of obscure iowa or british columbia municipalities having far more wikilinks than [ wiki link : syracuse , italy ] . as for inhabitants , [ wiki link : milan ] 's metropolitan area is far larger than [ wiki link : rome ] , but this mean that milan is more notable and has had more influence ? the ruins of [ wiki link : pompeii ] are uninhabited today : is its relevance reduced for this reason ? you must not use numerical pre ponder ances to take advantage in what is a matter of culture . ciao ! : a good analogy would be ancient [ wiki link : troy ] vs . [ wiki link : troy , new york ] . the ancient troy is also uni ha bi ted today , unlike the ny city . discussion\n",

      "well , let discuss problems with the current version of the article one by one : * problem : whether to use term \" southern hungary \" or \" southern parts of the p ann onian plain \" in two places . first , the term \" hungary \" is historically incorrect here and if we use this word , we would use historically correct term \" kingdom of hungary \" , but not \" hungary \" . second , term \" southern hungary \" imply that some province named like this existed in this area and province with that name never existed , so the correct term used would be \" southern parts of the kingdom of hungary \" . third , even term \" southern parts of the kingdom of hungary \" is not correct because we , in the first case , speak about time when area was conquered by the ottoman empire , so in that time we do not speak about kingdom of hungary at all , but about ottoman empire , and , in the second case , the name of the country to which this area belonged was habsburg monarchy , so i do not see relevance of usage of word \" hungary \" there . it is clear that only problem here is that user ben de gu z want to write word \" hungary \" in as many places as he can . : this is not true ! southern hungary as a term is often used by various authors . panonian simply pushes his pov everywhere . a swede also wrote \" hungary \" which panonian revised to [ external link : p ann onian plain ] . in the same article panonian pushed his pov op po si tely of everything and everybody . a czech posted [ external link : this ] , and called this dispute [ external link : idiotic ] , which part panonian easily \" i xed the two in your post . : it is irrelevant for you , because both of them make you see red . : ok ben de gu z , now see some logic : the article speak about kr u ev l je and if we want to mention wider area of which kr u ev l je was part of in the th century , we can mention all of those : habsburg monarchy , kingdom of hungary , ba county , p ann onian plain , ba ka region . so , we can mention any of those territories , so tell me ben de gu z , why you insist that exactly hungary is mentioned here instead other ? i do not insist that we mention p ann onian plain , we can mention ba county or ba ka region instead , or we should not mention any of those , but only thing that we should mention is the village itself . i am really open to any compromise that anybody could propose about usage of those terms . : * all the hungarian and a lot of serb population of all southern hungary fled to the north before the turks . here is not necessary the word southern hungary . southern counties or bo dro g county ( because it was bo dro g county ) is also good . : * came up with the german colonization of the southern hungary it is fact and it is ok for me . : ben de gu z , did you read my previous post at all ? kingdom of hungary was just a province of the habsburg monarchy , therefore to avoid any dispute about this , we should mention that \" it was german colonization of southern parts of the habsburg monarchy \" . i hope it is not disputed that name of the country should be mentioned because if we do not mention name of the country , then we indeed would have a dispute which of the \" smaller \" terms we would mention - kingdom of hungary , p ann onian plain , ba county , ba ka region . kingdom of hungary simply was not a country , and importance of this name compared with name habsburg monarchy is much smaller . regarding first thing , if they left area before turks arrived , the we can use term kingdom of hungary there of course , but not term \" southern hungary \" , because hungary ( ma ar ska ) is a name of the state that was created in and before that there was only u gar ska ( kingdom of hungary ) , but not ma ar ska ( hungary ) . : your small ness is really hard to explain . probably [ external link : this ] is not enough for you even now . read again . : what exactly you want that i read there ? i really do not understand what that page have to do with my previous post - the only thing that i see there is that the page you mentioned also use variant \" kingdom of hungary \" instead of \" hungary \" , so what is problem here really . why you want to use word \" hungary \" instead of \" kingdom of hungary \" ? : i do not understand your fear ! i do n't see that in every sentence write , kingdom of france , republic of france , french empire , but just france . the situation is the same with spain , or with germany . when somebody speaks about east - germany , everybody knows that it was not the same part in , in or in of the present - day germany . distinction between kingdom of hungary and hungary ( u gar ska - ma ar ska ) is in use just in serbian and slovak historiography and nowhere else . : but the exact problem is that we speak here about part of serbia and therefore the view of the serbian historiography must be respected here . kingdom of hungary is simply compromise version between usage of word hungary and serbian word u gar ska . : . yes , but this is the english wikipedia , so english - language conventions should be observed , even if they offend delicate serbian sensibilities . see [ wiki link : wp : english ] . : name kingdom of hungary is also english - language convention used in wikipedia , so i do not understand your comment . : apo lo gi esi misread your comment . ooops . : parts of the p ann onian plain are [ wiki link : sem ber ija ] , [ wiki link : mac va ] , [ wiki link : kol u bara river ] basin , [ wiki link : great mor ava ] basin which were not parts of hungary { except mac va for a short period ) , nor had significant hungarian population , nor was german colonization efforts in these regions , but in southern hungary . let we see the maps . we can see [ external link : here ] more than maps about hungary from various periods and from various authors , and we can see on every map the term \" hungary \" . is everybody stupid except you panonian ? : i explained this already and hungarian web site can not be relevant source about this - in the times when central europe was ruled by ottoman empire , area was divided into ey al ets and no single of those ey al ets did not had name hungary , but no matter of that , some hungarian sources used term \" hungary \" for those lands simply because of their own nationalism and their point of view that it was hungary and not ottoman empire - it is same pov that you want to push here , ben de gu z , and such pov is not acceptable since we know that it was ottoman empire and not hungary . : good lord . again with the \" hungarians can not be relevant or reliable . \" can anyone but a serb be trusted , in your mind ? : since we speak about serbia here it is clear that serbian sources are more trust ful than hungarian , croatian , etc . it is because serbs do not have territorial pre ten sions towards their own country and therefore serbian sources could afford to be objective , while hungarian or croatian sources are much influenced with nationalistic politics - even the basic wish of one hungarian or croatian author to w ri tte about territory in serbia is in most cases influenced by exp an sion istic pre ten sions towards that territory . : in \" most cases \" ? c ri pes , panonian , i 'm hungarian and i have n't noticed any massive widespread irredentist bias among my countrymen , on wiki or off . : really ? you did noticed that ? i just wonder why . : that 's easy because i see the world as it is and you see it as you think it should be . like it or not , the vast majority of hungarians ( and everybody else ) are just nice normal folks , not ir re dentists and not extremists . : the way how i see the world is a question for long discussion . regarding hungarians , i never spoke about \" all hungarians \" or even not about \" most hungarians \" - i only speak about certain individuals that either edit wikipedia in bad faith or w ri tte other bad faith things in other places . : vince b wrote an admirable [ external link : manual ] for you or about you , i do n't know . : actually i think it was for tank red , and the polish version is funnier anyway . ) : i have no time to read st up i di ties written by vince b . : i know , you like to read your own . : please refrain from personal insults . : then you find time to read it . it 's very awakening . : i do not want to damage my brain , i would need my brain healthy in the following years . : being open to consider others ' ( even \" enemies \" ) points of view is a good way to keep your brain healthy . it works for me , i recommend it to anyone . ) : i heard that point of view first time many years ago and nothing has changed in it - and not only during my life , but nothing has changed in that point of view in the last years , so how can somebody be open to it ? it is an defeated idea not acceptable in the st century and i do not understand that some people still speak about it . : i meant just in general , not about whatever specific issue you guys are fighting over today . : i am always open to new progressive ideas , i only have problem with certain \" specific issues \" that are neither progressive neither new . * problem : the question whether soldiers in world war i were hungarian or austro - hungarian . everybody who knows history know that there was no separate hungarian army in world war i , but only austro - hungarian army , and i can only imagine reasons why user ben de gu z want to change this . : there were austrian units ( austrian land wehr ) with german as command language , hungarian units ( magyar k ir ly i hon v ds g ) with hungarian as command language , and mixed units ( k . und k . ) with german as command language , so it is very possible that they were hungarian soldiers ( hon v dek ) in [ wiki link : austro - hungarian army ] . : we do not speak about units , but about army - there simply was no hungarian army in that time . : you must read first what you wrote : \" soldiers in world war i were hungarian or austro - hungarian \" ? they were hungarian soldiers . : ben de gu z , i can not believe that you want to twist even this simple historical fact . did you ever read this article : [ externa link : http : en . wikipedia . org wiki austro - hungarian army ] it is time for you to read it now . : really nice , panonian , you twist your own words , and accuse me for twisting . in wwi one of my ancestors served as hungarian h us sar ( magyar h us z r ) in galicia , another in hun g at ri an infantry ( magyar baka ) as maxim gunner near ison zo , while another as k . und k . ( k z s baka ) logistics soldier in c att aro . : the simple fact that you obviously can not understand is that hungarian h us sars were not hungarian army , but a component of austro - hungarian army . : but you talk about soldiers and just later about armies and not me ! \" soldiers in world war i were hungarian or austro - hungarian \" ? : ben de gu z , i can not believe that we speak about this - soldiers are just members of the army and army was austro - hungarian . why i have to explain all those simple things to you ? : you must read first the news from the neighborhood . czech soldiers in k for , slovak soldiers in k for , german soldiers in k for . etc . k for is probably the army . : no , k for is not army - it is peace - keeping force . * problem : term \" occupation \" that ben de gu z want to use for establishing of serbian rule is pov because we speak about village in serbia and therefore this word have negative attitude towards serbia which is far from neutral point of view . : these are also [ external link : words ] of ber ber mi los , but i do not understand what is negative in word \" occupied \" . serbian army did n't come with flowers and candy bars , but they came with arms , and it was de jure southern hungary until june , . : you are not advocate of ber ber mi los to speak in his name - he probably copied entire text from somewhere not know ning every word from it . also , the word \" occupied \" is insulting for local inhabitants of the village and their view is that serbian army liberated the village from austro - hungarian occupation . if you like , i can insist that we use word \" liberated \" instead , but as gesture of good faith i insist that we use only neutral word \" entered \" . : this is it panonian , everybody is stupid except you . and when occupied austro - hungarians the village ? crazy wind blows from crazy hole . : i am just trying to explain to you how pov word \" occupied \" really is and if i follow your own logic i could also to insist on pov words such is \" liberated \" , but i do not insist on that , no matter that majority of people in serbia , in vojvodina , and in the village of kr u ev l je itself consider that word \" liberated \" is proper word for usage here . i chal enge you to explain why word \" entered \" is bad or pov compared with words \" liberated \" and \" occupied \" . : in ( or , what you want ) kr u ev l je became a part of the newly established kingdom of serbs , croats and slo ven ians . this sentence is enough , i think . : now we see some progress . * problem : the sentence that ben de gu z deleting that \" new state gave to germans and other ethnic groups more opportunity for development of their language and culture , which they did not had during the hungarian administration that pursued aggressive mag y arization policy \" is very correct because new state indeed gave more opportunities to all ethnic groups for development of their language and they did not had such opportunities during hungarian administration . : the new state gave higher taxes for \" ethnic groups \" as opportunity in the region and nothing else . the germans were the most oppressed \" group \" after hungarians in this region . and what about macedonians , albanians , bosniaks , montenegrins , they were also under cultural and linguistic oppression in the \" new state \" . : the linguistic opportunities about which i speak are for example those in court where new state proclaimed that language of the parties is also language of the trial comparing to that during hungarian rule , the only language of the trial was hungarian , but in the new state germans could have trial in their own language . : but this remained on the proclamation level , as other dis pos als of treaty of tri anon . : ok , you might be right about this or might not be right , i admit that i do not know was it only proclamation or was implemented in practice too , therefore , i do not insist that this sentence remain here . * problem : i think that previous problems are main reasons why ben de gu z reverted this , but problem number is that ben de gu z also reverted all my im pro v ments , grammatical and other corrections in this article because of previous four points with which he do not agree . if he have any specific reason why he reverting my im pro v ments that are not connected with first problems , i would like to know what this reason is\n",

calling a communist dictatorship a \" people 's republic \" is so pov it 's laughable , and it 's laughable because it 's so obviously a lie . : in my own studies of government systems , i came to the conclusion that there is actually very little difference between an \" ideal \" communist state and an \" ideal \" democracy . the main difference is that in an ideal communist state the people are supposed to somehow automatically know what is best for everyone , and make policies based on that , while in an ideal democracy people get to try to convince each other what is best for themselves is also best for everyone . in actual practice , no government since the ancient incas or ancient athens has approached either ideal . the \" communist \" states of the modern era were actually just plain dictatorships or com mi tt e esh ips lying about themselves , and the \" democracies \" are mostly imi tations of the ancient roman republic . : i forgot to say that at least the \" communist \" regimes of the recent era had a reason to lie : karl marx indicated that a period of dictatorship was needed to sort - of force people to learn how to become un selfish enough to \" automatically know what is best for everyone \" . so the main reason those regimes fell was because , apparently , human selfishness is tougher than a dictatorship . meanwhile , somebody pointed out above that the term \" pro - life \" is a \" big lie \" ( well , i suppose it might be true if the logic is valid ) . what rationale have the pro - lifers got , for such a lie ? besides short - sightedness , that is ? and why should anyone that short - sighted be believed regarding anything about public policy or even wikipedia policy ? : ugh ! white man speak in ri dd les ! : what riddle ? either the human race is heading toward a mal th su ian catastrophe , or it is n't . if it is , then anything that helps the process along can not be called \" pro - life \" . let 's see . here 's some evidence that people who would be called \" pro - life \" today were indeed thinking about the short term instead of the long term : [ wiki link : great famine ( ireland ) ] . here 's something about the fish in the seas : [ externa link : http : www . eco earth . info blog ocean ecosystems collapsing ru . asp ] that word \" sustainability \" has a meaning that a lot of people seem to be ignoring : it is physically impossible to \" sustain \" a food supply in a limited space ( such as the oceans ) if the population depending on that supply keeps growing ( in other words , population must be sustained , too ) . here 's something about farm land : [ externa link : http : articles . latimes . com - local me - prime - farm land ] while that 's just one city , the same thing is happening to growing cities all over the world . who is taking the long view , that we need that farm land to feed that growing population ? does anyone really expect \" fishing \" to take up the slack ? note to all here : i apologize for getting off - topic , but i 've decided that i completely agree that abortion opponents using the label \" pro - life \" are truly indulging in a [ wiki link : big lie ] without even knowing it at least i hope they are n't deliberately trying to cause a malthusian catastrophe ! : ugh ! white man speak nonsense ! need read more aquinas ! : mere claims that something is nonsense are worthless . what evidence can you offer ? whatever thomas aquinas had to say , it did not include facts about the modern world , such as : ( ) synthetic fer ti li zers are essential to feed today 's global population ( [ externa link : http : www . t fi . org fact sand stats fer ti li zer and food . cfm ] ) , and ( ) much of that fertilizer requires petroleum , one way or another , during its manufacture , which ties the cost of fertilizer to the cost of petroleum ( [ externa link : http : www . time . com time world article , . html ] ) , and ( ) the world 's petroleum production rate is near is maximum possible peak ( [ wiki link : peak oil ] ) , after which total production will inevitably diminish , with prices of everything dependent upon it going up while their production rates also decline , and ( ) the fresh water needed to grow crops is also becoming globally problematic ( [ wiki link : water crisis ] and [ externa link : http : www . we bo f creation . org earth problems water . htm ] ) . a [ wiki link : poll y anna ] attitude may be fine and dandy for aquinas and others , but it does n't change the basic facts ( a ) that while all those just - listed problems are happening , humanity is adding - odd million new mouths - to - feed to the [ wiki link : world population ] each year , and ( b ) that people on [ wiki link : easter island ] did indeed experience at least a partial malthusian catastrophe ( population drop ) , proving that humanity on island earth is not immune to the possibility . so , what facts , not mere speculations or unsupported worthless claims , can you offer to offset the evidence that larger troubles , than we have now , are on the way ? ( note to others : i 'm not trying to \" right a great wrong \" here ; i 'm merely want to see how kenatipo can support what he says , despite the facts against him , that i 've sp outed \" nonsense \" . ) : v objectivist . , i 've got some really bad news for you the population on easter island is growing again . if you do n't mo sey on over there and kill off a few people , they 'll be facing another \" malthusian catastrophe \" real soon . leave your laptop at home , and give us a full report when you get back . your friend , : v objectivist . , st . thomas just asked me to remind you that it would be wrong for you to kill anyone on easter island ( unless it was self - defense ) . so , you 're on your own . your friend , : is that the best you can do ? duh , is n't it obvious that if the whole world 's human population is increasing in the present era , then that of easter island probably is , too ? what you wrote does nothing to address the facts i presented earlier . therefore , i submit that it is you who speak nonsense . if all you have is nonsense to spout , then you ( and anyone else who dares to spout similar nonsense ) can be ignored in this debate about changing the title of the other article , from using the short - term truth but long - term lie of \" pro - life \" . : i had another idea . since the sun is going to flame out in several billion years and we would n't want those alive on earth then to suffer the pain of freezing to death , why do n't we all slash our wrists and throats right now ? ( ap res vous , mon si eur ! ) your friend , : more nonsense , i see . that 's because the sun can do its world - bro iling thing completely independently of human actions , but if a malthusian catastrophe strikes humanity , it will be entirely the fault of humanity . i 'll re - phrase what malthus wrote , very simply , as : \" any species that breeds like a bunch of stupid animals is , eventually , going to mostly die like a bunch of stupid animals . \" and mathematics does n't lie ( [ externa link : http : www . kor ansky . com track ers other is any on eli st ening . html ] ) . go ahead , do some population - increase calculations all by yourself , and see what worldwide total numbers of mouths - to - feed are most likely to exist in the reasonably near future . then think about what sort of standard - of - living could be possible for them , given the available facts about , during that same reasonably near future , declines in oil production , fertilizer production , fresh - water availability , and even technically important metals ( [ externa link : http : www . businessinsider . com energy - and - mineral - production - on - a - permanent - downward - spiral - ] ) . consider the \" eventually \" proposed by isaac asimov ( the prior \" is anyone listening \" link ) , in which the entire mass of the universe is techno magically converted into human bodies during the next , years or so , after which everyone dies , since there will be no oxygen to breathe it was all converted into human bodies , see ! ? in the absence of such techno magic , a global malthusian catastrophe for humanity is very probable very much sooner , possibly even before this current century ends . if you really think the human species is more than just another bunch of stupid animals , then try proving it with facts not nonsense ! showing how we are \" immune \" to a malthusian catastrophe , in spite of asimov 's math ( or , better , what we - as - a - species should do to prevent it , that ordinary stupid animals ca n't do ) . : as chuck ye ager says : never borrow trouble . : you do n't have to borrow trouble if it is headed your way ( see all those links i included above ) just by doing nothing . so , anyone who is truly \" pro - life \" is going to work toward preventing a malthusian catastrophe , while the average ordinary \" pro - lifers \" , who have n't been doing any long - term thinking - it - through ( exactly like stupid animals that ca n't do long - term thinking ) , need to have their ignorance cured . after which either ( a ) they also will begin to work toward preventing a malthusian catastrophe , or ( b ) they will be revealed as actually \" pro - genocide \" of most of the human race , and their usage of \" pro - life \" is , indeed , just a [ wiki link : big lie ] ( which obviously means it should not be used in the title of a wikipedia article ! ) . in which category are you , now ? : i have a confession to make , objectivist . i 've been in the deaf ( tl ; dnr ) category for your last three paragraphs . : that 's fine ; if your response to being offered information is to choose to be ignorant , then you should recuse yourself from being involved in an informed discussion such as this overall page . which again means there becomes one less objection to changing the title of a wikipedia article from using the faulty phrase \" pro - life \" ! : your malthusian catastrophe argument does n't change any votes . your human life , like everyone 's , began at your conception . it 's called pro - life because it seeks to keep the mother and her unborn baby alive . : yes , i know full well that the \" pro - life \" crowd is only interested in talking about the short term , and not interested in the long term consequences of their acts . in the long term , though , how do you plan on keeping them alive ? why is n't it obvious that your short - term efforts will be totally wasted if they all die anyway , of starvation ? they ( along with most of the rest of humanity ) will have been murdered by folks like you , who want un feed able mouths to be born ! and that 's why your policy , long - term , is nothing less than \" pro - genocide \" . by the way , please do n't tell other stupidly obvious lies , like when you use the phrase \" unborn baby \" it 's not a \" baby \" until after it is born , alive ( [ externa link : http : www . thefreedictionary . com baby ] ) . applying the word prior to birth is just wishful misleading ( lying ! ) thinking , which gets d ashed perhaps of the time when a miscarriage or still - birth naturally happens ( [ externa link : http : em edic ine . med scape . com article - overview a ] ) . : frankly , my dear , i think you should stick to \" cold fusion \" .

( and i do n't feel defeated ) . kenatipo speak ! : pardon me ; i neglected to keep in mind that your postings in the other discussion revealed that you prefer ignorance to information , thereby allowing you to believe nonsense you were told to believe ( as a child ) , regardless of whether or not there is any truth to it . what did aquinas say about that part of exodus where a husband is allowed to set an arbitrary value on the lives lost via a caused miscarriage ? has anyone besides me ever wondered about the possibility of that husband specifying a value of \" zero \" ? v ( talk ) : this sounds like an easy one . just because someone owes you \" a pound of flesh \" , under the law , does n't mean you are obligated to collect it . that 's answer number one , just off the top of my head . answer number two is : no one has ever proclaimed the infallibility of st thomas aquinas or his writings , simply because he and his writings are n't infallible . kenatipo speak ! : please do n't misquote the bible . the verses clearly indicate that the husband gets to set any arbitrary value he wants , and that is what would be owed ; there is no \" default \" value specified ( e . g . a pound of flesh ) . which means that it should be obvious that , at least for unborn human life , its value can be zero whenever the person in charge of it wants it to be zero . it is allowed to be zero by the bible ! and i now rephrase something i wrote above : \" like most philosophers , aquinas only got some things right \" . v ( talk ) : hey , you guys , you know what 's a really good wikipedia article ? [ wiki link : er istic ] . chaos ( talk ) : i thought i was misquoting shakespeare ! i stand by my answer . and , while aquinas was not infallible , what he wrote contains tons of truth with a capital t , which is why the church holds him is such high regard . chaos , of course , is correct . it is unlikely that you could convince me of your position and vice versa , so let 's go on to bigger and better things ( as much as i enjoy arguing ) . kenatipo speak ! : chaos may be correct about you , but my goal is more to educate the ignorant than to just win an argument . one of the problems with aquinas living in the th century was that this was long before the microscope was invented , and thus it was also long before human sperm and eggs were discovered . any religion - based claims made , that do n't take the fundamental facts into account ( about the molecular biology of reproduction ) , are merely claims . for example , there is the claim that a soul begins to exist at conception . the problem here is that the egg - fertilization process is now known to be purely physical in nature , and anything that can be created as a result of a purely physical process can also be destroyed by purely physical means . therefore , if it happened to be true that an immortal ( and thereby non - physical ! ) soul begins to exist at conception , it can only do so as a consequence of some other and purely non - physical process . perhaps an act of god . however , god is supposed to know lots of stuff . like , for example , whether or not the dna in that just - fer ti li zed egg is faulty , and will lead to a miscarriage . is god some kind of idiot who creates ( or some kind of weak ling forced to create ? ) souls for bodies that ca n't possibly be born ? apparently , a lot of people seem to thing that god is exactly such an idiot or weak ling . not me ! how about you ? then there 's the physical process that yields identical twins , or triplets , or qu ads , or . it happens days after egg - fertilization , when a \" blastocyst \" is ready to leave the egg and hunt for a womb in which to implant . the blastocyst can literally break apart into separate individuals during the process of getting out of the egg . where do those other souls come from ? or , worse - for - the - soul - creation - at - conception - notion , are a significant number of people whose bodies are \" chim eras \" . there was an extremely interesting show a few years ago on the discovery health channel on that topic , titled \" i am my own twin \" . it turns out that two separate bla sto cy sts , which might typically develop into fraternal twins , can sometimes merge to form just one human body that gets born . where did the second soul go ? it seems to me that god has always known all about the t winning and chim er ism situations , and , logically as a result , altogether ref ra ins from creating souls until the reproductive situation has st abi li zed ( thereby falsifying the claim of a - soul - begins - existing - at - conception ) . oh , but god should also know how likely a woman is to seek an abortion ! why should a loving god create a soul in that case just so the woman can be condemned ? finally , what does an unborn developing human body need a soul for , anyway ? it 's not like there any significant free - will choices it can make during a pregnancy ! worse , the womb is , for at least the first six months after conception , a \" sensory deprivation \" environment , and experiments show that most people will go crazy after a week or so , locked into such a place . why would god do that to an innocent soul ? v ( talk ) please feel free , objectivist v , to ex pati ate at will and at length on my talk page . i am an inclusionist and i enjoy the attention ( at least while you 're typing you wo n't be out molesting children ) , but please do n't expect any responses from me anything i could say to you is probably more eloquently expressed in the catechism of the catholic church or the sum ma theo lo gi ae . kenatipo speak ! : i took a quick look and did n't see much in the way of truths . just claims . how about you pick one ?

ha ! well , here 's something that has acquired some ( not a lot , yet ) attention from science [ externa link : http : www . snopes . com religion soul weight . asp ] i 'm just waiting for the experiments to be done , to find out when a soul 's weight is added , either to a just - fer ti li zed egg , or to a new - born baby , or to the developing body somewhere in - between . v ( talk ) : i 'm not interested in ir ration alities that have zero supporting evidence . real truths always , always make logical sense , and can be supported with facts . here 's a hypothetical question for you . suppose a flying saucer landed near you and an obviously non human alien being stepped out , and politely requested directions to an abortion clinic , because such a thing was n't obtainable elsewhere . what would you say ? remember , we 're not talking about human life here . v ( talk ) ( the next line was originally posted on my talk page , and has been moved to here , where it belongs . ) : unlike you , i do n't believe in little green men , pregnant or otherwise . kenatipo speak ! : please note i specified \" hypothetical \" . that 's because the evidence for such is slim although , possibly , better than the evidence for sightings of the virgin mary ( [ externa link : http : www . u fo evidence . org topics sts - . htm ] ) . anyway , it certainly is a big universe out there , with plenty of room for other intelligent species . most people do n't even realize that the part of the universe that we can see , often called \" the observable universe \" which is known to contain at least billion galaxies averaging bill on stars each is , logically , just a small piece of a larger ( and still finite ! ) whole . the logic relates to a conventional explanation of the observation that all the relatively distant galaxies appear to be rec eding away from us ( the farther away , the faster ) . they say to imagine a spherical balloon with some dots evenly spaced on its surface , and to then inflate the balloon . you will easily see the distance increase between the dots . that 's an \" analogy \" , which can be extended by noting that only a portion of the surface of that inflated balloon represents the \" observable universe \" we would be in that balloon surface , seeing only a local area , very much like when you stand on the surface of the earth , you only see the local area out to the horizon . the rest of the balloon 's surface is certainly there , but we just ca n't see it . multi dimensional analogies can be fun . let 's look at a \" lower \" dimensional version of the analogy , which is an expanding circle in a flat area . like the balloon surface , we would place a bunch of dots around the circumference of that circle , and as it expands , the dots become more and more separated ( and we would be one of those dots in that curved line ) . do note that the bigger the balloon or circle , the \" flatter \" or \" stra igh ter \" any small segment of the circle or balloon - surface will seem to be ( remember all those centuries when many people thought the surface of the earth was mostly flat , mountains and valleys excluded . ) mentally moving dimension ally the other way , the universe we observe occupies a - dimensional volume of space , and it appears to be very \" flat \" we ca n't detect much in the way of a - dimensional curvature ( except near objects that have huge gravitational fields ) . if our observable universe is a segment of the \" surface \" of an inflated - dimensional \" hyper balloon \" , then it is most - extremely huge , and our observable universe is a very tiny segment of it , indeed ! so , that allows for plenty of room out there for other intelligent species , than just us humans here on earth . ( whether or not any of them would deign to visit us , given the bigoted and xenophobic tendencies of much of humanity , is another question altogether ! ) i therefore repeat , given the hypothetical situation where you encounter an intelligent non human alien being , who asks for directions to an abortion clinic , what would you say ( hypothetically , of course ! ) ? v ( talk ) : on the extraterrestrial - aliens front , there is one particular claim that is often made . do note that i know it is a claim , and so i do n't give it a lot of credence , but i do find it to be ( quoting a famous fictional human alien cross breed ) \" fascinating \" . because , so far as i know , everyone who claims to have been abducted by aliens also makes this claim . the claim is that the aliens are tele pathic . humans basically mostly are n't . it has occurred to me to wonder about the definition of \" an animal \" . here on earth we assume a \" mere animal \" is just about every non - human on the planet , dolphins and certain primates possibly excepted . but what would tele pathic aliens think ? could it be that to them , every non - tele pathic species is a mere animal ? if so , then human ego tism could be in for a big shock someday ! although , as seems to be mostly true ( and i would do this too , if i was them ! ) , the aliens mostly stay away from earth because these animals are armed with nuclear weapons ! v ( talk ) : here 's something about a real live non - human intelligent being koko ( gorilla ) well , she 's about as intelligent as a human todd ler who has only recently learned some language skills , but then koko also only has about the same amount of brain as a human todd ler . v ( talk ) : a somewhat more alien species ( gori llas , after all , have something like of their dna in common with humans ) , which also appears able to communicate c re atively is the dolphin ( [ externa link : http : www . mi li tar y photos . net forums showthread . php ? - dolphins - have - language - including - names - researchers - say ] ) . one of the reasons that it has been difficult for humans to figure that out is the simple fact that some of the sounds a dolphin can make are ultrasonic , outside the range of human hearing . how easily could you learn understand a human language if you could only hear one word in three ? and an even more alien species is the octopus . they can communicate sound lessly , using their camouflage ability to change skin col oration - patterns ( and their eyes , with full color vision , are actually better - engineered than mam mali an eyes ; their re tin as ca n't det ach and they do n't have \" blind spots \" ) . and , remember , oc top i are equipped with environment man ip ul ators ( they have tentacles ; we have fingers ) . large oc top i have fairly large brains , also . it is as yet unknown whether or not they can communicate intelligently , like dolphins , koko , and humans . we might be eating them too fast to ever find out . i suppose some religions are stupid enough to claim we should eat them , before we can find out ! just so that another worthless \" p rec ept \" about the \" moral superiority of humans \" ca n't be falsified ! v ( talk ) : \" oc top i \" is n't a valid plural of \" octopus \" . it 's a mistaken formation based on interpreting \" octopus \" as having a latin \" - us \" ending when in fact it has a greek \" - pus \" ending . chaos ( talk ) : \" valid \" depends on the dictionary . i have one here ( paperback \" sc ri b ner - ban tam english dictionary \" , entries , copyright & , my edition printed in ) that indicates both of the plural forms of \" octopus \" are acceptable . personally , i like \" oc top i \" because it takes less time to type , but when reading if i encounter either form i know what the writer is talking about , and that 's good - enough for me . arguing about it is like arguing whether to spell ( for example ) a certain other word as \" color \" or \" colour \" . v ( talk ) : \" valid \" depends on the dictionary ? and you call yourself an objectivist . chaos ( talk ) : the fact that most things are relative is indeed an objective truth . ( that 's why \" pro - life \" can be accurate in the short term but mean \" pro - genocide \" in the long term ! ) but you are welcome to pick up your favorite dictionary and tell me what it says about the plural of \" octopus \" . the dictionary i mentioned ( and i did n't look to see what it said until after i read your earlier post ) i bought years ago becuse it seemed to be the paperback with the most entries ( most other paper backs have - thousand ) , not because i was expecting it to support a certain point of view . v ( talk ) : - ( if someone wants to add new text to the preceding , please do so in - between these pa ren the sized de li mi ters . thank you ! ) ( end of this - space - reserved for new text . ) : - : - ( the next three subsections were copied from , \" the worse offense \" section ) overpopulation subsection ( and lead - in to a debate ) in discussions it is far worse to shut someone up by deleting what they say , than to shut someone up by proving what they do say is n't worth saying . the former is an act of cowardice , practiced by book - bur ners throughout history , who were afraid that a differing opinion would result in less control over other people . truth always hurts liars and the deluded , but only those groups . honorable people have nothing to fear from truth . if you believe that a \" pro - life \" stand incorporates more truth than a pro - abortion - rights stand , then you should be able to back it up in a debate . if you ca n't back it up , then your so - called \" truths \" are n't necessarily what you think they are that 's a real truth . you 've thrown down the gauntlet by , apparently , not wanting others to see my willingness to directly debate any \" pro - li fer \" into a kind of speech lessness on that topic ( because just about anything you say can be used against you ) . do you have the integrity to follow through ? we shall see ! : by the way , after writing the above i went over to the mediation page and looked at your reversion , and noticed the comment about a \" personal attack \" . perhaps you missed the original now - deleted discussion about a malthusian catastrophe ?

( do recall the overall relevance , because wikipedia wants a suitable long - term title for the article devoted to your side of the abortion debate . ) ( i need to say that due to other com mi tt ments i can only work on this debate at odd ball intervals . ) : i really have no familiarity with the \" malthusian catastrophe \" , but if i understand it correctly as being about overpopulation - the essay you link to was written in the s with s logic . overpopulation is a myth . it 's not that people started having more children , it 's that the medical technological advances of the past - years caused people to stop dropping like flies . even if banning abortion did cause dire overpopulation , it would n't be any better than the alternative - with today 's increased life ex pe c tan cies and below - replacement fertility rates , there will be a disproportionate number of elderly who will have to be supported by the depleted ranks of workers . news flash ! someone else an astro physicist has followed in asimov 's footsteps , writing a blog titled \" do the math \" .

: you can ask , heh . i 'm going to take my time working up to an answer , though . let 's start with the fact that lots of people believe things that other people do n't . for example , do children believe in santa claus ? what about santa 's elves ? and , are elves \" people \" ? would a child who believes in santa 's elves bother to claim that only a human can be a person ? how about someone who greatly enjoys science fiction and fantasy ? the im ag in ations of a great many people have had no difficulty whatsoever accepting the notion that lots of beings can be non human but also people , despite , so far , their complete and utter fic tionality ( [ externa link : http : www . star wars . com dat ab ank location mo se is ley can tina ] ) . ( and to really understand the flavor of this concept , consider god , who does n't have a physical body at all , and therefore is non human , but still has many characteristics that most adult humans would probably associate with the concept of \" person \" . ) : do you see where the preceding leads , though ? there is a very important question that must be answered . \" what is , precisely , the difference between a generic person being , and a mere animal ? \" the answer to that question needs to be universally applicable . it would likely not be right for us to someday travel to some distant planet and start eating the local life - forms , only to find out later that some of them qualified as people ! ( [ externa link : http : www . mi li tar y photos . net forums showthread . php ? - dolphins - have - language - including - names - researchers - say ] ) so , we need a definition of person such that every imaginable ( to say nothing of actual ) sort of person fits the definition , while every imaginable actual sort of animal fails to fit the definition . : and after that definition has been devised , all you have to do is apply it to any unborn human you choose . so far as i know , they will all only qualify as \" mere animals \" ; they are human bodies that lack the generic thing that would qualify an organism as a person . ( consider fully - adult humans that have dead brains and are on full artificial life - support . those human bodies have lost the thing that would qualify an organism as a person , which is why they can be legally unplugged from that life - support . ) by the way , this next thing is united - states - specific , because it is about the constitution and the founding fathers . i think you will agree that they were a fairly religious group ? when they wrote the constitution , they used the word \" person \" throughout . in the constitution is a requirement to take a census of all persons every decade . the first census was in , and the founding fathers were still very - much \" there \" to decide what should and what should not be counted as a person . ( they counted a slave as of a person , back then . ) unborn humans have never been counted in any census ( [ externa link : http : www . census . gov history www through the decades index of questions ] ) , including the most recent one of ! ( likely reason : \" do n't count your chickens before they hatch ! \" about of all pre gn ancies mis carry or result in still birth , and of course some result in twins , or triplets , or . ) but perhaps you have some information on unborn humans and the concept of \" person \" that i lack . let me know ! : you 're looking at it more philosophically ; i look at it scientifically as well . the way i see it there are three options for when life begins - birth , viability , conception . ) it would n't make sense for life to begin at birth because the baby is no different outside the mother 's body than it was inside ; all that has changed is its location ( for example , getting in our out of a car does not change you ) . another problem with life beginning at birth is that if the baby is halfway through the birth canal , is it half human ? no , because that is biologically impossible . ) it would n't make sense for life to begin at viability because viability is subjective . with the advance of medical technology , babies born earlier and earlier can survive and even thrive outside the womb . viability was weeks a decade or two ago ; now it is - weeks , and that number will only get smaller and smaller as time goes on . ) the only option left ( and if there 's another , tell me ) is conception . the single cell formed at conception contains all the information ever needed for that unique being . from conception , nothing is added to the being but oxygen , nutrition , and time . the same is the case with born persons . therefore , the unborn baby is indeed a person . at least scientifically ; hopefully philosophy will adhere to science . and it is very hard to find a credible scientist who will deny that life begins at conception these days . : you seem to be confusing \" life \" with \" person \" they are two different things . you certainly know that vast numbers of ordinary animals ( and plants ! and bacteria ! ) are completely alive , while none of them are considered to be \" persons \" . for humans to be an exception to that general observation means that humans must have something that other ordinary life - forms lack . furthermore , because of the stuff i wrote at the start of this subsection , it is important to accept that various other organisms , including entirely non - physical types like god , can also have that special distinguishing characteristic , which separates people from mere animals . i completely agree that the life of any human organism begins when egg - fertilization occurs , but i also have no reason to think that just because it is alive , it must also automatically qualify as a \" person \" . : to clarify this , consider that modern medical technology has almost reached the point where it would be possible to cut someone 's head off , and keep both head and body alive separately , indefinitely , afterward . let us now imagine med - tech gets appropriately better , so a super - fast emergency response team could someday be called to save someone when an accidental de cap i tation happens . should they rescue the head or the body , to save the life of the person who was de cap itated ? i think you will agree that they must save the head , despite it weighing only maybe three kilograms , while the rest of the body might easily weigh more than fifty kilograms and despite the fact that both parts are completely human and completely alive at the moment de cap i tation occurs . ( remember it takes about minutes of lack - of - oxygen to kill the brain , and i specified that this imaginary emergency response team was super - fast . ) well , it is a scientific fact that a just - fer ti li zed human ov um has no significant brain . it has molecular biological hardware that can process dna instructions like it was computer code , but that 's all . however , every living cell has that much , so why should only that human cell be called a person , again ? : here is another piece of medical information that can lead to an even bigger problem with the idea that a just - fer ti li zed human ov um should be called a \" person \" . there is a goal of figuring out how various animals can re - grow ( \" re generate \" ) lost limbs . obviously every para ple gic and qu adri ple gic could benefit from such a medical breakthrough , and progress has been getting made ( [ externa link : http : www . times online . co . uk tol news uk article . ece ] ) . well , imagine ultimate success , and the consequences of that . if you lost a finger , you could re - grow it . but you could also take that finger and grow a whole new body from it ! every time you bleed , you lose white blood cells that are fully human and fully alive and , with regeneration technology , fully able to grow into new human bodies . well , there is no requirement that just because something is possible , it must be required to happen . it is absurd to think that a just - fer ti li zed human ov um is any more significant , with respect to \" person - ness \" , than one of those lost white blood cells . : there is something more that i want to say , that properly should have been added to my previous post here . in biology , it is recognized that there are two major fundamental strategies pursued by various organisms , with respect to reproduction : [ externa link : http : en . wikipedia . org wiki r k selection theory ] humans are \" k \" strate gi sts ; we care greatly about our offspring ( and , of course , anything that can be done can also be over - done , as proved by the existence of abortion opponents ) . in the realm of science fiction , speculations exist about intelligent beings whose biology is based on \" r \" strategy . the best - known such work is [ externa link : http : en . wikipedia . org wiki stranger in a strange land ] , with fictional person - class mar tians . lesser - known , but involving the same fictional mar tians , is [ externa link : http : en . wikipedia . org wiki red planet ( novel ) ] . a feature of this story is the misunderstanding of \" r \" strategy by the humans who were colon izing mars . see , an \" r \" strategist can have hundreds or even thousands of offspring at a time . most of those offspring must be allowed to die while growing up ( else human \" overpopulation \" would be as nothing compared to what those non humans would experience ! ) . a relevant question is this : \" at what stage during growth should the offspring of person - class ' r ' - strate gi sts themselves be called ' persons ' ? \" the book \" red planet \" tries to get the reader to understand that question . but i happen to think it is relevant to humans , too , despite our being \" k \" strate gi sts . because it is so easy for us to make more unborn humans ( so easy that most types of birth - control fail now and then ) , that there is no need to assign to them as much value as , say , actually - born - alive humans . : i 'm not a philosopher , so i 'm not equipped to respond to the route you 're taking . i just go with what science and common sense tell me . but in response to \" i completely agree that the life of any human organism begins when egg - fertilization occurs , but i also have no reason to think that just because it is alive , it must also automatically qualify as a ' person ' , \" what else is it ?

( but : [ externa link : http : travel - for - love . com the - dolphin - and - the - fishermen ] ) i could now argue that humans who enslaved other humans did not at that time qualify as persons ( ! ) , because they put their own selfish desires ahead of others , un com pro mis ingly . ditto with those who caused the holocaust . but that would be a rather extreme argument , since it is reasonable to think that at other times those same humans were able to compromise their selfishness . ( just like a sleeping person is unable at that time to do much , but can be quite capable after waking up . ) it is assumed that god does compromise , also , because we are allowed to have \" free will \" . and even in fiction our treatment of non - human alien beings is closely related to the manner in which they are willing to interact with us ( compare the movies [ wiki link : alien nation ( film ) ] and [ wiki link : independence day ( film ) ] and , since many humans are bigoted x en op ho bes , we can still fail to do the ri gh tor best thing : [ wiki link : district ] ) . meanwhile , unborn humans ( and brain - dead humans on full - life - support ) utterly and totally can not participate in conscious compromise ; therefore , by this philosophical analysis , they are mere animal bodies only . simple ! : so can new bor ns and todd lers be killed too because they can not \" consciously compromise \" their desires and are therefore not persons ? : tsk , trying to confuse the subject ( this is a debate about abortion ) is a waste of time . even if we scientifically proved that new bor ns and todd lers could not qualify as persons ( i 've seen evidence suggesting they begin to qualify about months after birth ) , there is a whole history of precedents and \" grandfather clauses \" and such - like which would prevent any changes in laws regarding their treatment . nor do i have any desire to change those existing laws . i do , however , desire to point out how short - sighted and narrow - minded and founded - on - bad - data and poorly - thought - through are the arguments to change also - existing laws that currently allow abortion . for example , if it was proved that even recently born humans are merely animals , then what would be the rationale for opposing abortion ? animal - cruelty laws ? read on ( after the next paragraph ) ! : it could be noted that this question i presented earlier : \" at what stage during growth should the offspring of person - class ' r ' - strate gi sts themselves be called ' persons ' ? \" that question can be compared somewhat to early human growth . the main difference is that a human needs a womb during that period , while \" r \" - strategist offspring are able to fend for themselves in the outside world ( where most would get eaten by other life - forms ) . but both start from a single cell ( recall that regeneration technology means \" it is absurd to think that a just - fer ti li zed human ov um is any more significant , with respect to ' person - ness ' , than one of those lost white blood cells \" ) , and eventually both types of offspring could become adult organisms . and both become qualified as persons somewhere along the way . that 's the comparison i 'm writing this paragraph about ; \" birth \" does n't have to have anything to do with person - ness . if traits of person - ness begin to be appear about months after a human 's birth , then it likely happens at an equivalent stage of brain - growth for the \" r \" - strategist . there is no room for bigotry or hypocrisy or unproved claims in science ( plenty of room for speculations , though ! ) . : i will now proceed to specify the exact difference that \" birth \" makes , with respect to the descriptions \" newborn \" and \" unborn \" . some opponents of abortion do question , after all , how there can be any significant difference , when the bir thing process might take just a few hours . we all know , of course , that part of the difference is the simple fact that the um bi lical cord is no longer relevant to that human 's survival . however , what of the larger picture ? think in terms of the phrase [ wiki link : modus operandi ] . for every moment of its existence while attached to a womb , the survival mode of that human involves pure selfishness . it takes oxygen and nutrients without regard to the health of the woman ( as bad as a fictional person - class \" vampire \" , which is , typically in fiction and despite qualifying as a person ! to - be - executed - immediately - upon - discovery - by - any - means - possible ) . it also dumps bi ow a ste into the woman 's system , also without regard to her health , and sends her a mildly psychoactive hormone ( [ external link : h cg ] ) to make her feel good about it ( worse than even a fictional vampire ! ) . those are scientific facts about unborn humans . after birth , however , it ca n't do any such things ! its survival depends utterly on receiving gifts including the gift of having its bi ow a ste voluntarily removed . that 's the big difference birth makes ! and so , because of its uncompromising ( even un com pro mis able ! ) selfishness right up to the moment of first breath , it is entirely reasonable to think that an unborn human is entirely equivalent to just and only ! a mere animal . : however , i 'll also note that we have laws regarding treatment of animals . if a late - term abortion is to be done , when it is possible for the unborn human to feel pain ( the brain is n't even connected to the rest of the body during the first two tri me sters ) , then an appropriately pain less or fast method should be used . fairly standard stuff , that , when \" putting down \" an animal ! : - ( if someone wants to add new text to the preceding , please do so in - between these pa ren the sized de li mi ters . thank you ! ) ( end of this - space - reserved for new text . ) : - : - religion responsibility subsection most scientists would say that life begins well before conception . however , that only barely scratches the surface on the subject of abortion . here 's a fascinating article on the subject by dru yan and her late husband , sagan , titled \" [ external link : abortion : is it possible to be both \" pro - life \" and \" pro - choice \" ? ] \" : tl ; dr i 'll read it soon . but skimming over it , the claims that the catholic church did n't oppose abortion until recent times is false ; the [ wiki link : did ache ] condemned it . : there used to be a perfectly valid reason for a religion of any stripe to ban abortion , masturbation , on anism , homosexuality , or any other thing that might reduce the birth rate . well , \" valid \" in the sense of \" good for the religion \" , if not for anyone else . i refer you to what i wrote earlier about overpopulation and how warfare began to be practiced seriously , to obtain resources from others . any group that could cause enough warriors to be born would obviously enhance its ability to conquer the neighbors . and religions directly benefit in the form of \" ti thes \" . as a result , at one time the roman catholic church was the wealthiest organization on the planet . then the reformation happened , as its greed was exposed , along with the [ wiki link : thirty years war ] . nowadays we have \" separation of church and state \" specifically to prevent religions ' greed for money and power from causing more wars . unfortunately , the middle east did n't learn that lesson like europe did . and so one of the \" hot spots \" of the present era 's global population explosion is the middle east , thanks to the political powers that their religions have seized . : because its self - interest is involved , that 's an excellent reason why one should be very suspicious of any claims made about unborn humans by any religion . also note that because of the current [ wiki link : world population ] situation , all the old religion - started bans need to be rescinded ; we need as many harmless - to - civilization ways as possible to reduce the global birth rate ! it 's been a while since you last posted to this debate . did i really post a \" taunt \" when i indicated on the mediation page that i was willing to render speechless any other pro - li fer ? or was i stating a truth ? no matter . i 'm utterly confident that there is exactly one valid argument that pro - lifers can raise to oppose elective abortions . but that argument depends on the total population of humanity being so small it risks extinction if the gene pool is n't kept shuffling . nothing like that has been true for about , years ( see [ wiki link : toba catastrophe theory ] ) , so that particular argument is irrelevant to today 's world . all other anti - abortion arguments are inherently invalid , because they are all based on faulty data such as the unproved claim that an unborn human qualifies as a \" person \" at the very least . : other faulty data is the claim of \" right to life \" . in the natural world there is no such thing ! where was the \" right to life \" for the giant dinosaurs when that big meteor arrived ? where was the \" right to life \" for all those people in the capital of haiti when that earthquake recently hit ? and so on . nature cares not one whit about humanity 's \" right to life \" . all that it really is is a convenient tool to help persons to get along better with each other ! and , as we are slowly beginning to recognize , we need to get along with various non - person elements of the natural world , also , lest we destroy the bio sphere and make ourselves extinct . the law of cause and effect can not be ignored , and religions have been pushing awareness of that rule for millennia . well , so they do occasionally get something right ! although , of course , they still fail to accept that the long - term consequences of a \" pro - life \" anti - abortion stand will most certainly be a malthusian catastrophe ! : one result of the law of cause and effect is an anti - abortion argument involving the fact that sexual intercourse is linked to pregnancy . \" you caused it , so you need to take responsibility for it ! \" is the gist of the argument . the problem with that argument is that it over looks the actual details of what happens in - between sexual intercourse and pregnancy . the first intermediate thing is that sperm must encounter an egg . does sexual intercourse control sperm ? of course not ; they are independent cells organisms acting independently of either participant in sexual intercourse . conception is utterly and purely the fault of the sperm and egg , interacting did you know the egg is as active a participant as the sperm ? ( [ externa link : http : discover magazine . com jun the ag gre s sive egg ] ) . it seems possible that , at least on rare occasions , an egg might reject every sperm it encounters . all sex does is give sperm and egg an opportunity to interact . they are not required to do so , and of course sometimes the egg is n't even there , to be a participant . : another key intermediate step , between sexual intercourse and pregnancy , is the im plantation in the womb by a blastocyst , several days after conception . again , the blastocyst is an independent organism , doing its own thing completely independently of the sex act . it is well - known that bla sto cy sts sometimes fail to implant . nor is there anything in nature that requires them to do so , as a result of the sex act . if the claim that \" sex causes pregnancy \" was literally true , then pregnancy would result from every act of sexual intercourse ! all sex actually does is increase the probability that pregnancy can occur . and even then , something like of all couples are naturally unable to reproduce ! ( also , please recall that sex is actually not required for pregnancy , due to the actual existence of \" artificial in se min ation \" , and is claimed to not be required , due to the claimed existence of \" [ wiki link : virgin birth ] s \" . it is not known if [ wiki link : par then ogenesis ] can happen in humans , but it is known that if it does , the offspring must be female . ) : so , exactly where does the responsibility lie , when pregnancy happens ? most of it is the fault of the blastocyst , especially if someone wants to claim that it is a person - class organism ! there is no evidence that it qualifies as such , though . some of the responsibility can be assigned to the participants of the sex act , since sex can , after all , increase the probability that pregnancy can occur . this is crucial . if the participants were entirely responsible , then huge consequences might legitimately be associated with it ( e . g . , \" the pregnancy must be carried to term and the offspring must be raised to adulthood \" ) . but since the sex - participants are in fact only partially responsible , lesser consequences can be associated with it ( e . g . , \" deal with it one way or another ; it 's your problem ! \" ) . : here is an analogy : suppose you decided to walk near a marsh , and some mo s qu i toes flew out and tried to bite you . must you let them ? surely you knew in advance , when you decided to take that walk , that the risk was there ! however , since mo s qu i toes are independent organisms and are not person - class , it is entirely acceptable to swat them . \" how dare they desire to suck my blood ! \" this is actually a pretty good analogy , because a blastocyst is an independent organism , and is not person - class , and its goal is to implant in a womb in order to suck blood . therefore it should be entirely acceptable to swat abort it ! ( not to mention that if it is considered acceptable to execute a fully - person - class fictional vampire for taking blood against the will of a potential donor , the \" person - ness \" of a blastocyst or embryo , or fetus should n't matter in the slightest , if a woman wants an abortion ! ) : - ( if someone wants to add new text to the preceding , please do so in - between these pa ren the sized de li mi ters . thank you ! ) ( end of this - space - reserved for new text . ) : - : - ( the next subsection was copied from , \" hey , yankees ! \" section ) mis - using the language subsection are you having fun yet ? hang in there , ol' buddy ! : the point remains true that neither of you ( nor any other pro - li fer ) has any valid data showing how a \" pro life \" force - more - mouths - to - feed - to - be - born policy can not cause a malthusian catastrophe in the long term , that it is not in the long term in - essence a \" pro - genocide \" policy that will cause the death of most of humanity , including most of those mouths that were forced to be born ! therefore , since wikipedia wants an article title that can be appropriate for the long term , all of you should logically accept that \" pro life \" can not be in that title . when will you folks learn that \" too much of any good thing is always , always a bad thing \" ? : your line of thinking is so bizarre that i find it impossible to argue with ( not because it 's correct , but because it 's bizarre ) . you acknowledge that an unborn baby is a human being , yet you do n't think it becomes a person until long after it 's born , and you advocate the slaughter of those human beings because they are a burden to the world . : even \" bizarre \" can be correct if there are no factual or logical errors . if you ( or any other pro - li fer ; all are invited to check what i 've written ! ) can not find any such errors , then why not simply admit the conclusions i 've reached are entirely valid ? meanwhile , you are using [ wiki link : weasel words ] when you use the phrase \" human being \" for an unborn human . here 's why . first , you might search the text i wrote above to see how i used the word \" being \" . ( ignore any usages where the word has meaning similar to this example : \" being late for work increases the risk of getting fired \" . ) i most specifically did not once use the phrase \" human being \" when talking about unborn humans . you should see that i did use \" being \" as a synonym for \" person \" . that 's because , all through common everyday use of the english language , while we might say \" human being \" or ( occasionally ) \" alien being \" , we almost never say \" dog being \" or \" worm being \" or \" donkey being \" . ( exceptions tend to occur in science fiction , where it is a handy way to describe the appearance of an intelligent or person - class alien so , again , \" being \" is synonymous with \" person \" ) . : the relevance of the preceding is simply this : how often do you say \" zy go te being \" or \" blastocyst being \" or \" embryo being \" or \" fetus being \" ? if you and other pro - lifers really thought that humans qualified as persons from conception , you would use those descriptions as casually as you use the phrase \" human being \" , when describing unborn humans . so , the point i 'm making is that while at any unborn state a particular organism can be perfectly human , it is not a being unless it also qualifies as a person . therefore , by calling it a \" human being \" you are weasel - word pro pag an di zing your totally unproved po in tof view and it will be remain both unproved and unprovable so long as the facts and logic i 've presented earlier are valid , about , say , the need for a universally applicable definition of \" person \" , or , perhaps , the fact that the census questions show that the very religious founding fathers of the united states did not consider unborn humans to be persons ; have fun trying to find a flaw in what i wrote ! which means that i did most certainly not \" acknowledge that an unborn baby is a human being \" i never even used the phrase \" unborn baby \" ( which are more pov - specific [ wiki link : weasel words ] check your dictionary for the definition of \" baby \" ) ! and therefore i most certainly have not advocated the slaughter of any \" human beings \" ! nor have i actually \" advocated \" the slaughter of mere animal - class unborn human bodies i 'm simply advocating that such slaughter should remain legal where it currently is legal , and become legal where it is n't and that all pro - genocide activities disguised as \" pro - life \" cease forthwith ! : look ; bizarre or not , much of my argument is designed to open your thinking to more possibilities than are normally considered by pro - lifers . only by being \" close - minded \" ( pretending they have all the relevant data ) can they think their arguments make sense . but , hey , anyone who believes in god ( most pro - lifers ! ) automatically also believes in a non - human intelligent being ( by definition , if god created the physical universe , then god ca n't have a physical body , human or otherwise ! ) . so , with god and humans as examples of different varieties of intelligent beings or persons , what do they have in common ? and why should the universe be limited to only those two examples ? \" just because religions claim it \" is not good enough ! which means it is necessary to consider what all intelligent beings must have in common , to be de sc ri b able as persons , and not as \" mere animals \" . so far , a major part of the most sensible answer appears to be \" a mind that has certain minimal capabilities \" . so , when i wrote the paragraph about an imaginary de cap i tation accident and a super - fast emergency response team , the point of that was to force recognition that the head is where the mind is located ; the body matters not at all , with respect to person - ness ( especially if an entity like god can exist with no physical body at all ! ) . and when i mentioned how brain - dead humans on full - life - support can be unplugged , i was being consistent ; their minds are gone and all that remains are mere animal bodies . which directly leads us to the abortion debate and the mental capabilities of unborn humans . for the first several months they have no mind at all ( brain is under construction ) . for the last months their brains are functional at an animal level of mental ability ; they do n't have the \" certain minimal capabilities \" associated with the person - class level . those are scientific facts . you did earlier say something about paying attention to what science and common sense tells you ? well , i do the same ! i 'm merely using more data than you were using . : - ( if someone wants to add new text to the preceding , please do so in - between these pa ren the sized de li mi ters . thank you ! ) ( end of this - space - reserved for new text . ) : - money subsection ( copied from [ wiki link : wikipedia : arbitration requests abortion ] ) i do n't especially care about the titles of wikipedia articles , except where a title can be extraordinarily misleading . \" pro - life \" appears to be such a title ( per the definition of \" hypocrisy \" ) , and i will now explain why , an argument that so far as i know is generally unknown . it is categorized as \" original research \" here . : consider a simple \" model economy \" in which the population and the resources needed to sustain that population are well - matched . and , as in the real economy , there are people who are \" middle men \" in terms of converting resources into goods for that population to consume . they operate businesses that hire laborers to do the converting , and they sell the goods , to be able to pay for the labor . standard stuff . : but what happens if more people are added to that model economy , without simultaneously increasing the available resources ? per the law of supply and demand , there will be increased competition for the available labor slots , which generally means wages would fall . simultaneously , per that same law , there will be increased competition for goods , which generally means prices would rise . does anyone benefit ? certainly ! the middle men who hire labor and sell goods end up with greater sales receipts and lower labor costs , resulting in greater profits . this is actually the fundamental mechanism , the world over , explaining how the rich get richer while the poor get poorer . : now of course some people will say that there is now an opportunity for someone to open up new resources to compete with those middle men . but , in the real world , it is well known that businesses try to stifle competition , and try to lock down resources and create mono poli es ( witness the diamond cartel ) , as an alternate way to increase prices and profits . there is no guarantee that the possible opportunity can actually be implemented . but there is every guarantee , per the law of supply and demand , that if the middle men can successfully cause the population to increase faster than the supply of resources , they will profit from it , while simultaneously causing laborers to have a tougher time making ends meet . the proof of this is to be found throughout the last half of the th century , in which , at its start , one l abo rer 's income usually sufficed to support a family , and now the incomes of two parents are all - too - often barely enough . the price of ordinary labor has most certainly not kept pace with the price of resources goods ! : those middle men can claim to be \" pro - life \" and oppose abortion , but what they act like is that they are pro - profit - only . they most certainly can directly personally benefit from increased competition for limited labor slots and limited goods . they apparently care nothing about the quality of life for all that extra life they want the economy to include ! if they were really pro - life , they would be willing to ensure that the cost of labor was always sufficient to sustain a decent life . yet many of those same business - oriented \" pro - lifers \" oppose minimum wage laws ! : the evidence of history is that resource - availability must increase faster than the rate of population increase for the overall quality of life of a population to increase . even though that would naturally mean , per the law of supply and demand , that wages would go up , to attract laborers who have many choices , and prices and profits would go down as goods flooded the markets , and the poor would get richer faster than the rich . as has actually happened in history when a new resource ( e . g . , big sections of north america ) suddenly became widely accessible for exploitation . : notice how important it must be for middle men businessmen to try to keep secret the wider consequences associated with claiming to be \" pro - life \" . they do n't want the foundations of their argument to be revealed as being equivalent to quick - sand , so of course they must automatically deny the validity of ( or even try to suppress ) any argument that points out the above wider consequences or any other wider consequences , some of which are even worse for pro - lifers than that one . i 've never seen the above argument published in a reliable source , yet it seems to me it should be simple and obvious to anyone with a decent background in economics . it should not be original - with - me research ! : - ( if someone wants to add new text to the preceding , please do so in - between these pa ren the sized de li mi ters . thank you ! ) : the simplest way to prove that many pro - lifers are hypocrites is to simply demand that they \" put their money where their mouths are \" , and make them pay for all costs associated with p ren atal care , child birth , and child - re aring , for every abortion that they desire to prevent . currently , pro - lifers somehow seem to think that other people should pay for what pro - lifers want , despite a long history that generally expects anyone who wants something to pay for it .

      "have you ever wondered why is it that mohammed , jesus , confucius , or socrates never wrote anything ? well you should . the vast majority of religions in doc tr inate their participants into thinking they are not allowed free will or opinion and that devi ance from the prescribed doctrines is grounds for dam nation . why is that ? the answer is rather simple . control . to understand the corruption that in fec ts society one should study [ wiki link : mac hi av elli ] 's [ wiki link : the prince ] . it is the foundation on which government , business and leadership is grown and the day it is cast aside is the day we emerge into the age of enlightenment . in order for one to understand the legacy behind the structure one must understand what controls are utilized to shack le humanity . people needed to feed their family , wars r aged and religion was a vehicle for preserving what one had . the same goes for the buddhist precepts . many believe that enlightenment is n't achievable if you do n't follow them . but one fails to ask why did they exist ? they existed for crowd control how can you teach someone when all they are thinking about it banging the hot babe next to them or c ra ving the bed of the wealthy patrol or the bar of soap their neighbor . if people are distracted by their environment they ca n't be listening to buddha . so he set some basic precepts to level the playing field and to encourage all to participate equally . basically , what i observe religions doing is what is commonly called brainwashing . why do religions do this ? it comes down to group mechanics . whenever you form a group one has to prescribe rules to control them or they tend to dissolve . otherwise , spiritual radicals will undermine them and steal away their [ wiki link : wid gets ] ( worship ers ) . but blind men try to lick up their masters idea and perverse the so - called purity of them and find ways to gain power and wealth lever aging the enlightened one . every christian branch came into being this way . like multi - level marketing spin offs the religious generals seeking power by spinning off their followers and forming a new branch . jesus , buddha , mohammad did n't write anything down , so keep in mind as you read any religious book that much of that is written and expressed is done by many mortal people , very limited people , very opinionated people , people with very special interests in mind . i think religious texts should be read like a comic book , dev oured and explore them emotionally and intellectually , then throw them in the trash and move on to the next . you should definitely use a pen and actively cross - out , circle and comment on everything that motivates as you read . write your ideas down as you do . do n't get s na red by the words . do n't become trapped in searching for god , allah or tao in the pages of a book ! if you want truth search for it in [ wiki link : plato ] and the other greek s op hi sts . everything from [ wiki link : atoms ] , [ wiki link : souls ] , [ wiki link : evolution ] vs [ wiki link : creationism ] , nature of god and [ wiki link : truth ] have already been thoroughly explored over years ago . the thoughts and emotional feelings you discover should be questioned . nothing should be taken at face value . if you read religious texts like this you will find a common through line in them all love and compassion for life and others . this common through line is what i call spirituality . the goal of any reading is to decipher and separate the crap from the substance and i think of what is written in these \" holy \" texts is utter crap written by ignorant men . ask yourself why is it saying that ? is it an imposed opinion ? are these social , political , cultural reasons ? most of the time there are . spirituality is the thread that links everything together ( [ wiki link : chief seattle ] [ external link : speech ] ) . call it science , god , shiva , tao , buddha , truth , devine , designer , gaia etc . call it whatever you want . but ultimately to name it is to person ify it , and to person ify it is to destroy it . i 'll explain what i mean later . simply put , spirituality is the sense of profound connection with the devine truth . this divine or truth can be given any name : god , tao , allah , shiva , designer , universe , but as mentioned before , to name it is to destroy it by making it less than what is it truly is . spirituality is the path that can lead to enlightenment . enlightenment is seeing through the veil that sh rou ds our life in illusions . there are many levels of enlightenment and each level brings us closer to the ultimate truth who am i ? all i can say is this truth is n't an intellectual answer , but one that is profoundly experienced and understood beyond words . many seek enlightenment out of a desire to obtain powers . there are no magical powers or abilities that come with enlightenment , just a greater power . an understanding of the question . and even if there were powers the fact that one would want them by obtaining enlightenment would in itself keep one from attaining enlightenment ( the yogi flying crux ) one of the questions i find hardest to answer when ask is \" what do you believe in ? \" i answer . \" i believe what you believe in . \" because i understand that they are trapped in their illusions and they are real to them as my reality is to me . but , what the person is really asking is \" what religion are you ? \" when faced with this question i always find myself relating this parable . \" that 's tough for me to explain , but let me see if i can . there is an old fable about six venerable blind sages all on a pilgrimage to worship their perspective god ( s ) and ideas . on the way they encounter an elephant . none had ever encountered one and an argument about what it was ensued . when asked what they thought it was . one explains \" the elephant is a like a huge tree truck ! \" as he reaches around one of the elephants think leg , \" no ! it is like a rope \" , said the old man who touched the tail , \" preposterous ! it is like a big snake \" , yelled a wise man grappling with the trunk . \" wrong as usual ! it 's like a spear ! \" ex claimed another defiantly as he felt one of the great tus ks . thus religions and philosophies s qu ab ble with one another about the truth as it is perceived from their particular angle of perception . their interpretations or perception are based on the particular part of the elephant ( religion ) they happen to be discovering . each is partly right ; however , they failed to see the big spiritual picture . they are not able to see the whole animal because of their individual bias and desire that has been defined by their genetic coding , environment and their individual experiences . the same applies to religions . this parable teaches us that we should explore and find the spirituality in all faiths and that by doing so maybe we will start seeing the true big picture . the rational behind this is simple . its like using multiple angles of perception to discover the truth of orientation . survey ors do this all the time be a spiritual sur ve yor . all religions are all true to a certain degree . we must recognize that pieces of the truth exist within all religions and beliefs because they are all describing an aspect of the whole . another good example is to imagine a prism and there is white light entering it and being ref rac ted into different colors of light . i believe in the light and recognize that all the colors are products of the one light thus all religions , and philosophies are the ref rac ted aspects of the one light . remember using words to describe it is completely different than feeling it\n",

( ) . the court was not asked to decide , and did not decide , whether constitutional limits on the congress apply within the \" federal zone . \" also , the case was not an income tax case . : one of the issues addressed in down es v . bi dwell was whether a federal statute imposing a duty or im post on products shipped from puerto rico to the united states ( in this case , from puerto rico to the port of new york ) violated the constitutional provision that all im posts and duties be \" uniform \" throughout the united states . the court also was asked to decide whether the same statute improperly required vessels moving from one state to another state to enter , clear , or pay duties in the other state ( in this case , a ship moving from puerto rico to new york ) , in violation of the constitution . : the court in down es v . bi dwell ruled that the statute was valid . the court stated that \" while [ , ] in an international sense [ , ] porto rico [ i . e . , puerto rico ] was not a foreign country , since it was subject to the sovereignty of and was owned by the united states , it was foreign to the united states in a domestic sense , because the island had not been incorporated into the united states , but was merely app ur tenant thereto as a possession . \" u . s . at - ( emphasis added ) . the court concluded that because puerto rico was \" foreign \" to the united states in the domestic sense , congress did have the power to impose the \" im post \" on goods shipped from puerto rico to new york , and that the im post did not violate the constitutional requirement that im posts be \" uniform \" throughout the united states . : hale v . hen kel , u . s . . defined the distinction between natural persons and corporations as it pertains to th amendment protections within the u . s . constitution . \" . we are of the opinion that there is a clear distinction in this particular between an individual and a corporation , and that the latter has no right to refuse to submit its books and papers for an examination at the suit of the state . the individual may stand upon his constitutional rights as a citizen . he is entitled to carry on his private business in his own way . his power to contract is unlimited . he owes no duty to the state or to his neighbors to divulge his business , or to open his doors to an investigation , so far as it may tend to c ri min ate him . he owes no such duty to the state , since he receives nothing there from , beyond the protection of his life and property . his rights are such as existed by the law of the land long antecedent to the organization of the state , and can only be taken from him by due process of law , and in accordance with the constitution . among his rights are a refusal to in c ri min ate himself , and the immunity of himself and his property from arrest or seizure except under a warrant of the law . he owes nothing to the public so long as he does not tre sp ass upon their rights . upon the other hand , the corporation is a creature of the state . it is presumed to be incorporated for the benefit of the public . it receives certain special privileges and franchises , and holds them subject to the laws of the state and the limitations of its charter . its powers are limited by law . it can make no contract not authorized by its charter . its rights to [ u . s . , ] act as a corporation are only preserved to it so long as it obe ys the laws of its creation . there is a reserved right in the legislature to investigate its contracts and find out whether it has exceeded its powers . it would be a strange anomaly to hold that a state , having chartered a corporation to make use of certain franchises , could not , in the exercise of its sovereignty , inquire how these franchises had been employed , and whether they had been abused , and demand the production of the corporate books and papers for that purpose . the defense amounts to this : that an officer of a corporation which is charged with a criminal violation of the statute , may plead the criminality of such corporation as a refusal to produce its books . to state this proposition is to answer it . while an individual may lawfully refuse to answer incriminating questions unless protected by an immunity statute , it does not follow that a corporation , vested with special privileges and franchises , may refuse to show its hand when charged with an abuse of such privileges . \" : [ note : hale v . hen kel was not a tax case . no tax issues were presented to or decided by the court . ] : flint v . stone tracy co . , u . s . . defined excise taxes as taxes laid on corporations and corporate privileges , not in natural persons . \" excises are taxes laid upon the manufacture , sale or consumption of commodities within the country , upon licenses to pursue certain occupations and upon corporate privileges . the requirement to pay such taxes involves the exercise of [ u . s . , ] privileges , and the element of absolute and unavoidable demand is lacking . conceding the power of congress to tax the business activities of private corporations . the tax must be measured by some standard . it is therefore well settled by the decisions of this court that when the sovereign authority has exercised the right to tax a legitimate subject of taxation as an exercise of a franchise or privilege , it is no objection that the measure of taxation is found in the income produced in part from property which of itself considered is non taxable . \" : editor 's note : in flint v . stone tracy co . , u . s . ( ) , the u . s . supreme court ruled that the corporation tax act of did not violate the constitutional requirement that revenue measures originate in the u . s . house of representatives . contrary to the statement in the text above , the court did not rule that excise taxes consisted only of taxes on corporations and corporate privileges , to the exclusion of taxes on \" natural persons . \" the issue of the validity of an income tax imposed on \" natural persons \" was neither presented to the court nor decided by the court . sorry , tax protesters . yours , : weeks v . u . s . , u . s . . established that illegally obtained evidence may not be used by the court or admitted into evidence . this case is very useful in refuting the use by the irs of income tax returns that were submitted in v ol un tarily ( note that these returns must say \" submitted under compulsion in violation of th amendment rights \" or some such thing at the bottom . \" the effect of the th amendment is to put the courts [ u . s . , ] of the united states and federal officials , in the exercise of their power and authority , under limitations and re stra ints as to the exercise of such power and authority , and to forever secure the people , their persons , houses , papers , and effects , against all unreasonable searches and seizures under the guise of law . this protection reaches all alike , whether accused of crime or not , and the duty of giving to it force and effect is obligatory upon all in trusted under our federal system with the enforcement of the laws . the tendency of those who execute the criminal laws of the country to obtain conviction by means of unlawful seizures and enforced confessions , the latter often obtained after sub j ec ting accused persons to unwarranted practices destructive of rights secured by the federal constitution , should find no sanction in the judgments of the courts , which are charged at all times with the support of the constitution , and to which people of all conditions have a right to appeal for the maintenance of such fundamental rights . the case in the aspect in which we are dealing with it involves the right of the court in a criminal prosecution to retain for the purposes of evidence the letters and correspondence of the accused , seized in his house in his absence and without his authority , by a united states marshal holding no warrant for his arrest and none for the search of his premises . the accused , without awaiting his trial , made timely application to the court for an order for the return of these letters , as well or other property . this application was denied , the letters retained and put in evidence , after a further application at the beginning of the trial , both applications asserting the rights of the accused under the th and th amendments to the constitution . if letters and private documents can thus be seized and held and used in evidence against a citizen accused of an offense , the protection of the th amendment , declaring his right to be secure against such searches and seizures , is of no value , and , so far as those thus placed are concerned , might as well be stricken from the constitution . the efforts of the courts and their officials to bring the guilty to punishment , pra ise worthy as they are , are not to be aided by the sacrifice of those great principles established be years of endeavor and suffering which have resulted in their embodiment in the fundamental law of the land . the united states marshal could only have invaded the house of the accused when armed with a warrant issued as required by the constitution , upon sworn information , and describing with reasonable p ar tic ul arity the thing for which the search was to be made . instead , he acted without sanction of law , doubtless prompted by the desire to bring further proof to the aid of the government , and under color of his office undertook to make a seizure of private papers in direct violation of the constitutional prohibition against such action . under such circumstances , without sworn information and particular description , not even an order of court would [ u . s . , ] have justified such procedure ; much less was it within the authority of the united states marshal to thus invade the house and privacy of the accused . : [ note : weeks v . united states , u . s .

should be \" effect \" ] on the constitution , and that income taxes could only be sustained as excise taxes and not as direct taxes \" is misleading . what the court essentially said was that the th amendment did not give the congress a new power to tax incomes , as congress already had that power . : the th amendment as interpreted by the supreme court in the brushaber decision made the dichotomy between direct and indirect taxes essentially no longer constitutionally relevant with respect to apportionment of federal income taxes as apportionment is not required for any federal income tax after the sixteenth amendment . a detailed summary of brushaber is beyond the scope of this comment ; however , the following statement by the supreme court in brushaber ( ironically , quoted above by the tax protesters ! ) , in referring to the prior decision in pollock , is revealing ( emphasis added ) : moreover , in addition , the conclusion reached in the pollock case did not in any degree involve holding that income taxes generically and necessarily came within the class of direct taxes on property , but , on the contrary , recognized the fact that taxation on income was in its nature an excise [ i . e . , an indirect tax ] entitled to be enforced as such unless and until it was concluded that to enforce it would amount to accomplishing the result which the requirement as to apportionment of direct taxation was adopted to prevent , in which case the duty would arise to disregard form [ i . e . , its form as an indirect tax , or excise tax , which is not required to be apportioned ] and consider substance alone [ i . e . , to treat it as a direct tax , required to be apportioned ] , and hence subject the tax to the regulation as to apportionment [ i . e . , to treat the tax as a direct tax ] which otherwise [ , ] as an excise [ , ] would not apply to it . nothing could serve to make this clearer than to recall that in the pollock case , in so far as the law taxed incomes from other classes of property than real estate and invested personal property , that is , income from ' professions , trades , emp lo y ments , or vo cations ' , its validity was recognized ; indeed , it was expressly declared that no dispute was made upon that subject , and attention was called to the fact that taxes on such income [ i . e . , income from professions , trades , emp lo y ments or vo cations ] had been sustained as excise taxes in the past . : the quote above \" . the proposition and the contentions under [ the th amendment ] . would cause one provision of the constitution to destroy another \" is , with the bracketed words \" [ the th amendment ] \" a falsification of what the court actually said . the \" proposition and the contentions \" to which the court referred were not those of the th amendment . the \" proposition and the contentions \" to which the court was referring were the arguments of mr . brushaber 's attorneys , ju li en t . davies , brain ard tol les , gar rard glenn , and martin a . sch enc k arguments against the validity of the income tax arguments that the court rejected . the actual quote from the text of the court 's decision is as follows ( with emphasis added ) : but it clearly results that the proposition and the contentions under it , if acc eded to , would cause one provision of the constitution to destroy another ; that is , they would result in bringing the provisions of the amendment ex emp ting a direct tax from apportionment into ir re con ci lable conflict with the general requirement that all direct taxes be apportioned . moreover , the tax authorized by the amendment , being direct , would not come under the rule of uniformity applicable under the constitution to other than direct taxes , and thus it would come to pass that the result of the amendment would be to authorize a particular direct tax not subject either to apportionment or to the rule of geographical uniformity , thus giving power to impose a different tax in one state or states than was levied in another state or states . this result , instead of simplifying the situation and making clear the limitations on the taxing power , which obviously the amendment must have been intended to accomplish , would create radical and destructive changes in our constitutional system and multiply confusion . : but the court did not \" acc ede to \" mr . brushaber 's arguments . the court went on to reject these arguments , and mr . brushaber lost the case . the result of brushaber is that although an income tax on income from property was deemed ( under pollock ) to be a direct tax and an income tax on wages , etc . , was deemed to be an indirect tax ( an excise ) , the sixteenth amendment allows a tax on incomes without apportionment regardless of \" source \" that is , regardless of whether the tax is deemed direct ( for example , a tax on income from property ) or indirect ( for example , a tax on income from labor ) . : even in the pollock case , taxes on income from professions , trades , emp lo y ments or vo cations were not considered direct taxes and were not required to be apportioned , as these were indirect taxes ( i . e . , excises ) . further , nothing in pollock , the th amendment , or brushaber changed that . the court in pollock decided that an income tax on income from property was treated as a direct tax , and therefore had to be apportioned ( prior to the th amendment in ) . the brushaber court was saying that nothing in pollock required that a tax on , say , wages ( i . e . , an indirect , or excise tax ) would have to be apportioned to be constitutional . : the th amendment , as interpreted by the court in brushaber , made the distinction between direct taxes ( required to be apportioned ) and indirect taxes ( not required to be apportioned ) irrelevant with respect to the apportionment rule . in other words , after the th amendment the congress can constitutionally impose a tax ( whether direct or indirect ) on any income , regardless of \" source \" ( i . e . , regardless of whether the tax would be considered direct or indirect ) without the requirement of \" apportionment \" among the states , and without regard to any \" census or enumeration . \" brushaber is a very complex case with a terrible outcome for tax protesters perhaps the worst case a tax protester would want to be citing ! : stanton v . baltic mining , u . s . . declared that the th amendment conferred no new powers of taxation to the u . s . government , but simply prevented income taxes from being taken out of the category of indirect ( excise ) taxes to which they inherently belonged . \" . by the previous ruling it was settled that the provisions of the sixteenth amendment conferred no new power of taxation but simply prohibited the previous complete and pl en ary power of income taxation possessed by congress from the beginning from being taken out of the category of indirect taxation to which it inherently belonged and being placed in the category of direct taxation subject to apportionment by a consideration of the sources from which the income was derived , that is by testing the tax not by what it was at ax on income , but by a mistaken theory deduced from the origin or source of the income taxed . \" : editor 's note : in stanton v . baltic mining co . , u . s . ( ) , the u . s . supreme court rejected the argument that the income tax imposed by the tax act of october , ( ch . , stat . ) violated the sixteenth amendment . the court upheld the constitutionality of the income tax under the act . another dead end for tax protesters . yours , : peck v . lowe , u . s . . stated that the th amendment does not extend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects , but removed the need to ap portion direct taxes on income . the plaintiff is a domestic corporation chiefly engaged in buying goods in the several states , shipping them to foreign countries and there selling them . in its net income from this business was , . , and from other sources , . an income tax for that year , computed on the aggregate of these sums , was assessed against it and paid under compulsion . it is conceded that so much of the tax as was based on the income from other sources was valid , and the controversy is over so much of it as was attributable to the income from shipping goods to foreign countries and there selling them . the tax was levied under the act of october , , c . , , stat . , , which provided for annually sub j ec ting every domestic corporation to the payment of a tax of a specified per cen tum of its ' entire net income arising or acc ru ing from all sources during the preceding calendar year . ' certain fraternal and other corporations , as also income from certain enumerated sources , were specifically excepted , but none of the exceptions included the plaintiff or any part of its income . so , tested merely by the terms of the act , the tax collected from the plaintiff was rightly computed on its total net income . but as the act obviously could not impose a tax forbidden by the constitution , we proceed to consider whether the tax , or rather the part in question , was forbidden by the constitutional provision on which the plaintiff relies . the sixteenth amendment , although referred to in argument , has no real bearing and may be put of view . as pointed out in recent decisions , it does not extend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects , but merely removes all occasion , which otherwise might exist , for an apportionment among the states of taxes [ u . s . , ] laid on income , whether it be derived from one source or another . brushaber v . union pacific r . co . , u . s . , - , sup . ct . , ann . cas . b , , l . r . a . d , ; stanton v . baltic mining co . , u . s . , - , sup . ct . . : editor 's note : the above verbiage regarding the case of william e . peck & co . v . lowe , u . s . ( ) , is basically accurate . this is another case that tax protesters cite apparently because they do not understand what they are reading ! particularly devastating for tax protesters is the statement that the sixteenth amendment \" does not extend the taxing power to new or excepted subjects , but merely removes all occasion , which otherwise might exist , for an apportionment among the states of taxes laid on income , whether it be derived from one source or another . \" also , the constitutionality of the tax in this case was upheld . another dead end for tax protesters ! : ev ens v . gore , u . s . . overturned by o'malley v . woo dr ough ( u . s . ) . court ruled that income taxes on federal judges were unconstitutional . \" after further consideration , we adhere to that view and accordingly hold that the sixteenth amendment does not authorize or support the tax in question . \" [ a direct tax on salary income of a federal judge ] : editor 's note : the correct spelling of the \" ev ens \" case is evans v . gore , u . s . ( ) . the effect of evans v . gore was indeed overruled in o'malley v . woo dr ough , u . s . ( ) , where the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the federal income tax . in o'malley the court said : [ . ] the question immediately before us is whether congress exceeded its constitutional power in providing that united states judges appointed after the revenue act of shall not enjoy immunity from the incidences of taxation to which everyone else within the defined classes of income is subjected . thereby , of course , congress has committed itself to the position that a non - discriminatory tax laid generally on net income is not , when applied to the income of a federal judge , a di min ution of his salary within the prohibition of article iii , of the constitution . to suggest that it makes in roads upon the independence of judges who took office after congress had thus charged them with the common duties of citizenship , by making them bear their ali quot share of the cost of maintaining the government , is to tri vi alize the great historic experience on which the fram ers based the safe guards of article iii , . to subject them [ i . e . , u . s . judges ] to a general tax is merely to recognize that judges are also citizens , and that their particular function in government does not generate an immunity from sharing with their fellow citizens the material burden of the government whose constitution and laws they are charged with administering . : the \" bottom line \" of o'malley v . woo dr ough is essentially that the constitution does not exempt federal judges from liability for federal income tax . : eisner v . mac om ber , u . s . . defined income within the meaning of the th amendment as \" profit \" . prohibited direct , un apportioned taxation of income of a stock holder . the sixteenth amendment must be construed in connection with the taxing clauses of the original constitution and the effect attributed to them before the amendment was adopted . : [ note : this description of eisner v . mac om ber is misleading . further , the statement that the court prohibited the direct , un apportioned taxation of income of a stock holder is false . the case actually dealt with a stock dividend on stock that was essentially equivalent to a stock split , as opposed to a cash dividend on stock . in the case of this kind of \" dividend \" the stock holder does not receive anything or realize any additional value . for example , if a stock holder owns shares of stock having a value of per share , the total value is . if the corporation declares , say , a \" two for one \" stock dividend that is essentially similar to a stock split ( and the corporation di stri bu tes no money or other property ) , the stock holder now has shares with a value of each , which is still in value - i . e . , no increase in value and no income . the pie is still the same size but it 's sliced into more pieces , each piece being proportionately smaller . more directly to the point , there has been no \" sale or other disposition \" of the stock . the taxpayer still owns the same asset ( i . e . , the same interest in the corporation ) he owned prior to the stock dividend . so , even if his basis amount ( generally , the amount he originally paid for the stock ) is less than the value ( i . e . , even if he has an un realized or potential gain ) , he still has not yet \" realized \" the gain . this kind of stock dividend is not treated as \" income \" to a shareholder . the court did not rule on any issue involving the tax ability of ordinary \" cash \" dividends where the stock holder actually receives a check from the company , etc . this is definitely not a good case for tax protesters to be citing . ] in pollock v . farmers ' loan & trust co . , u . s . , sup . ct . , under the act of august , ( stat . , , c . , ) , it was held that taxes upon rents and profits of real estate and upon returns from investments of personal property were in effect direct taxes upon the property from which such income arose , imposed by reason of ownership ; and that congress could not impose such taxes without ap por tioning them among the states according to population , as required by article , , cl . , and section , cl . , of the original constitution . : editor 's note : the above verbiage regarding the pollock case is basically correct . however , the legal effect of pollock with respect to federal income taxes was eliminated by ratification of the sixteenth amendment to the constitution in . after the sixteenth amendment , income taxes that were deemed to be direct taxes in pollock ( i . e . , income taxes on income from property ) are no longer required to be apportioned . stated another way , congress may constitutionally tax incomes from whatever source derived without apportionment among the states , and without regard to any census or enumeration . yours , : editor 's note : the following paragraphs are from eisner v . mac om ber , u . s . ( ) . this case is often cited by tax protesters for the false claim that ordinary dividends on stock are not taxable , etc . see the discussion of this case elsewhere on this page on what the court actually ruled . yours , afterwards , and evidently in recognition of the limitation upon the taxing power of congress thus determined , the sixteenth amendment was adopted , in words lu ci dly expressing the object to be accomplished : the congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes on incomes , from whatever source derived , without apportionment among [ u . s . , ] the several states , and without regard to any census or enumeration . ' as repeatedly held , this did not extend the taxing power to new subjects , but merely removed the necessity which otherwise might exist for an apportionment among the states of taxes laid on income . brushaber v . union pacific r . co . , u . s . , - , sup . ct . , ann . cas . b , , l . r . a . d , ; stanton v . baltic mining co . , u . s . , et seq . , sup . ct . ; peck & co . v . lowe , u . s . , , s . , sup . ct . . a proper regard for its genesis , as well as its very clear language , requires also that this amendment shall not be extended by loose construction , so as to repeal or modify , except as applied to income , those provisions of the constitution that require an apportionment according to population for direct taxes upon property , real and personal . this limitation still has an appropriate and important function , and is not to be overridden by congress or disregarded by the courts . [ . ] after examining dictionaries in common use ( bou v . l . d . ; standard dict . ; webster 's intern at . dict . ; century dict . ) , we find little to add to the succinct definition adopted in two cases arising under the corporation tax act of ( stratton 's independence v . how bert , u . s . , , s . sup . ct . , [ l . ed . ] ; doyle v . mitchell bros . co . , u . s . , , s . sup . ct . , [ l . ed . ] ) , ' income may be defined as the gain derived from capital , from labor , or from both combined , ' provided it be understood to include profit gained through a sale or conversion of capital assets , to which it was applied in the doyle case , u . s . , , s . sup . ct . , ( l . ed . ) . brief as it is , it indicates the characteristic and distinguishing attribute of income essential for a correct solution of the present controversy . the government , although basing its argument upon the definition as quoted , placed chief emphasis upon the word ' gain , ' which was extended to include a variety of meanings ; while the significance of the next three words was either overlooked or mis conceived . ' derived - from - capital ' ; ' the gain - derived - from - capital , ' etc . here we have the essential matter : not a gain acc ru ing to capital ; not a growth or in c re ment of value in the investment ; but a gain , a profit , something of ex chan geable value , proceeding from the property , severed from the capital , however invested or employed , and coming in , being ' derived ' - that is , received or drawn by the recipient ( the taxpayer ) for his separate use , benefit and disposal - that is income derived from property . nothing else answers the description . [ . ] thus , from every point of view we are brought ir re si sti bly to the conclusion that neither under the sixteenth amendment nor otherwise has congress power to tax without apportionment a true stock dividend made lawfully and in good faith , or the accumulated profits behind it , as income of the stock holder . the revenue act of , in so far as it imposes a tax upon the stock holder because of such dividend , contravenes the provisions of article , , cl . , and article , , cl . , of the constitution , and to this extent is invalid , notwithstanding the sixteenth amendment . : editor 's note : the above paragraphs are from eisner v . mac om ber , u . s . ( ) . this case is often cited by tax protesters for the false claim that ordinary dividends on stock are not taxable , etc . see the discussion of this case elsewhere on this page on what the court actually ruled . yours , : bailey v . drexel furniture co . , u . s . . prohibited congress from legis lating or controlling benefits that employers provide to their employees . [ editor 's note : this is false . the issue of the power of congress to legis late or control benefits provided by employers to employees was neither presented to the court nor decided by the court . see below . ] a major blow against socialism in america ! \" out of a proper respect for the acts of a co - ordinate branch of the government , this court has gone far to sustain taxing acts as such , even though there has been ground for suspecting , from the weight of the tax , it was intended to destroy its subject . but in the act before [ u . s . , ] us the presumption of validity can not prevail , because the proof of the contrary is found on the very face of its provisions . grant the validity of this law , and all that congress would need to do , hereafter , in seeking to take over to its control any one of the great number of subjects of public interest , jurisdiction of which the states have never parted with , and which are reserved to them by the tenth amendment , would be to enact a de ta i led measure of complete regulation of the subject and enforce it by a so called tax upon departures from it . to give such magic to the word ' tax ' would be to break down all constitutional limitation of the powers of congress and completely wipe out the sovereignty of the states . \" : editor 's note : in bailey v . drexel furniture co . , u . s . ( ) , the supreme court ruled the child labor tax law unconstitutional as an improper attempt by congress to penalize employers using child labor by dis gu ising the penalty as a tax . further , the court later moved away from the philosophy of the bailey case . for example , see united states v . kah ri ger , u . s . ( ) , overruled on other grounds , mar che tti v . united states , u . s . ( ) . : cook v . tait , u . s . . the supreme court ruled that congress has the power to tax the income received by a native citizen of the united states dom ic iled abroad from property situated abroad and that the constitutional prohibition of un apportioned direct taxes within the states of the union does not apply in foreign countries . : editor 's note : pretty close . in cook v . tait , u . s . ( ) , the court did not mention \" un apportioned direct taxes \" and did not talk about whether the apportionment rule did or did not apply in foreign countries . the court did rule that the revenue act of , imposing an income tax on income of a natural born u . s . citizen living abroad ( where the property generating the income was also outside the united states ) , did not exceed the federal taxing power . in other words , the income tax was not unconstitutional . not a good case for tax protesters to be citing . : lucas v . earl , u . s . . the supreme court ruled that wages and compensation for personal services were not to be taxed in their entirety , but instead , the gain or profit derived indirectly from them . : [ note : this is not the ruling in lucas v . earl . this is a paraphrase from certain language taken out of context found in the taxpayer 's brief in the case , and reprinted as a head note in some but not all reprints concerning the case . the court rejected the taxpayer 's arguments and ruled against the taxpayer . the court ruled that the taxpayer was taxed on all his income as he earned it , regardless of the validity of contract under state law to assign some of his future income to another person ( namely his wife ) . tax protesters who do n't know enough about analysis of legal documents to tell a taxpayer 's brief containing a losing argument from the decision of the court itself probably should n't be quoting from such documents . definitely a terrible case for tax protesters to be citing . ] : railroad retirement board v . al ton railroad company , u . s . . the supreme court ruled that congress that it has no constitutional authority whatsoever to legis late for the social welfare of the worker . the result was that when social security was instituted , it had to be treated as strictly voluntary . \" the catalog of means and actions which might be imposed upon an employer in any business , tending to the comfort and satisfaction of his employees , seems endless . provisions for free medical attendance and nursing , for clothing , for food , for housing , for the education of children , and a hundred other matters might with equal propriety be proposed as tending to relieve the employee of mental strain and worry . can it fairly be said that the power of congress to regulate interstate commerce extends to the prescription of any or all of these things ? is it not apparent that they are really and essentially related solely to social welfare of the worker , and therefore remote from any regulation of commerce as such ? we think the answer is plain . these matters obviously lie outside the orbit of congressional power . \" : editor 's note : railroad retirement board v . al ton railroad company , u . s . ( ) was not a tax case . no issues of taxation were presented to or decided by the court . : h asse tt v . welch , u . s . . ruled that disputes over uncertainties in the tax code should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer . \" in view of other settled rules of statutory construction , which teach that . if doubt exists as to the construction of a taxing statute , the doubt should be resolved in favor of the taxpayer . \" : o'malley v . woo dr ough , u . s . . overturned portions of ev ens v . gore , u . s . , but not the part about the th amendment . [ editor 's note : regarding the language \" but not the part about the th amendment \" incorrect . see separate discussion . the \" bottom line \" of o'malley v . woo dr ough is essentially that the constitution does not exempt federal judges from liability for federal income tax . and the name is \" evans , \" not \" ev ens . \" ] \" however , the meaning which evans v . gore , supra , im pu ted to the history which explains article iii , was contrary to the way in which it was read by other english - speaking courts .

( ) , the \" income tax only applies to one of the three definitions [ of the term united states ] \" is false . the term \" united states \" as used in the [ wiki link : internal revenue code ] has at least two separate meanings . : when used in a geographical sense , the term means \" only the states and the district of columbia \" ( see ) . when used in a political sense , the term means the nation known as the united states of america , or the government of the united states of america , as in : \" [ a ] suit or proceeding referred to in subsection ( a ) [ i . e . , a federal tax refund suit ] may be maintained only against the united states , and not against any officer or employee of the united states [ . ] \" ( see ) . : the term \" united states \" can be and is used in the internal revenue code with respect to federal income taxes and other federal taxes in both of these senses sometimes in both ways in the same sentence . see , for example , . : further , the case of hoo ven & allison co . v . ev att involved the issue of whether an ohio state ad val orem tax on bal es of hemp and other fibers from the philippine islands was an im per missible state tax on imports ( article i , section , clause of the u . s . constitution ) . the case of hoo ven & allison co . v . ev att did not involve federal income taxes or any other kind of federal taxes . the term \" income tax \" does not even appear in the text of the court 's decision in this case . yours , : flora v . united , us . ruled that our tax system is based on voluntary assessment and payment , not on force or coercion . \" our system of taxation is based upon voluntary assessment and payment , not upon di stra int . \" : note : this particular decision in flora was rendered in ( not ) . the decision in question is flora v . united states , u . s . ( ) , which was a decision on a re hearing confirming the decision in a case decided and reported as flora v . united states , u . s . ( ) . and why do tax protesters keep citing the leading cases ? do n't they realize that all the tax lawyers have already studied these ? in flora , the supreme court ruled that a federal district court does not have jurisdiction to hear a lawsuit by a taxpayer for a federal income tax refund where the taxpayer has not paid the entire amount assessed ( the rule does not apply to u . s . tax court cases or bankruptcy cases ) . tax protesters sometimes cite cases like this for the false argument that filing of tax returns and paying taxes is not legally required , i . e . , that the filing of returns and paying of taxes is , in that sense , \" voluntary \" . not so . : the quoted language from flora refers to the federal income tax : \" our system of taxation is based upon voluntary assessment and payment , not upon di stra int . \" the key words are \" voluntary \" and \" di stra int . \" like many legal terms , \" voluntary \" has more than one legal meaning . in the context of the quoted sentence , the income tax is voluntary in that the person bearing the economic burden of the tax is the one required to compute ( assess ) the amount of tax and file the related tax return . in this sense , a state sales tax is not a voluntary tax - i . e . , the pur ch aser of the product does not compute the tax or file the related tax return . the store at which he or she bought the product com pu tes the sales tax , charges the customer , collects the tax from him at the time of sale , prepares and files a monthly or quarterly sales tax return and re mits the money to the taxing authority . : in flora , the court used the word \" voluntary \" in opposition to the word \" di stra int . \" di stra int is a legal term used in various contexts . for example , di stra int is used to refer to the act of a landlord who with holds property of the tenant already in the landlord 's possession to secure payment of past due rent . the property held for ransom , if you will , is said to be \" di strained , \" or \" distressed . \" the key connotation of the word \" di stra int \" is that there is often a forcible taking of possession or withholding of non - cash property to induce a debtor to pay an obligation with money . once the debt is paid , the property is released . obviously , the internal revenue service does not go around se izing everyone 's property every january just to get everyone to file a tax return and pay the tax by april th . that 's not our system . we rely on \" voluntary \" compliance . hey tax protesters ! get the drift ? : however , in another legal sense of the word \" voluntary , \" the obligation to pay the tax and file the return is not voluntary for either income tax or sales tax . for example , the internal revenue code is full of statutes specifically imposing the obligation to file returns and pay taxes , and imposing civil and criminal penalties for willful failure to do so on a timely basis . the difference is that in the case of the income tax , the taxpayer files the return , whereas in the case of the sales tax , the seller ( not the customer ) files the return . : folks , this is not rocket science . if you 're going to try to interpret law , you have to understand that a given word can have multiple meanings . by the way , courts do use the term \" voluntary \" in both senses , which of course confuses the tax protesters even more . and this is the easy part of tax law ! oh , just in case you tax protesters missed the hint : the supreme court in flora did not rule that people do not have to file federal income tax returns or pay income taxes . : james v . united states , us , p . , l ed d . income that is taxed under the th amendment must derive from a \" source \" . also established that em be zzled money is taxable as income . \" . the sixteenth amendment , which grants congress the power \" to lay and collect taxes on incomes , from whatever source derived . \" hel vering v . clifford , us , ; douglas v . will cuts , us , . it has long been settled that congress ' broad statutory definitions of taxable income were intended \" to use the full measure of taxing power . \" the sixteenth amendment is to be taken as written and is not to be extended beyond the meaning clearly indicated by the language used . \" edwards v . cuba r . co . us , [ from separate opinion by whit taker , black , and douglas , jj . ] ( emphasis added ) : brady v . u . s . , u . s . at . supreme court ruled that : \" wai vers of constitutional rights not only must be voluntary , they must be knowingly intelligent acts , done with sufficient awareness of the relevant circumstances and consequences . \" : garner v . united states , u . s . . supreme court ruled that income taxes constitute the compelled testimony of a witness : \" the information revealed in the preparation and filing of an income tax return is , for the purposes of fifth amendment analysis , the testimony of a witness . \" \" government comp els the filing of a return much as it comp els , for example , the appearance of a ` witness ' before a grand jury . \" : editor 's note : the correct date on garner is , not . as explained in a wikipedia article elsewhere , the defendant was convicted in connection with a conspiracy to \" fix \" sporting contests and to transmit illegal bets . during the trial the prosecutor introduced , as evidence , the taxpayer 's federal income tax returns for various years . in one return the taxpayer had showed his occupation to be \" professional gam bler . \" in various returns the taxpayer had reported income from \" gambling \" or \" wag ering . \" the prosecution used this to help contradict the taxpayer 's argument that his involvement in gambling was innocent . the taxpayer tried unsuccessfully to keep the prosecutor from introducing the tax returns as evidence , arguing that since the taxpayer had been legally required to report the illegal income on the returns , he was being compelled to be a witness against himself . the supreme court agreed that he was legally obligated to report the illegal income on the returns , but ruled that the privilege against self - in c ri min ation still did not apply . the court stated that \" if a witness under compulsion to testify makes disclosures instead of claiming the privilege , the government has not ' compelled ' him to in c ri min ate himself . \" in other words , mr . garner had simply failed to assert the privilege on the tax return itself , when he filed the return . : garner and other cases are viewed by some legal scholars as standing for the proposition that on a required federal income tax return a taxpayer would probably have to report the amount of the illegal income , but might validly claim the privilege by labeling the item with the words \" fifth amendment \" ( instead of \" illegal gambling income , \" \" illegal drug sales , \" etc . ) : central illinois public service co . v . united states , u . s . . established that wages and income are not equivalent as far as taxes on income are concerned . : editor 's note : wrong , and misleading . in the case of central illinois public serv . co . v . united states , u . s .

according to [ wiki link : wp : blp ] - only when representing a minority or being biased . biased means here that the author tries to give an untrue picture of that biography through the biased selection of the material . but this applies not to this article . it is definitely true that baron adonis is one of the few persons with only very few positive words in media since . and there are many words ! just look through the media . this fact might be due to his high influence on the controversial - billion - pound project and its un loved effect on hidden selection and elite creation . but the mainly negative or neutral press articles are also due to the undemocratic way of giving him political power through the peerage . therefore it is necessary to show exemplified some of the negative statements and his political background especially towards elitism as well as the key arguments about his peerage . this might look biased but is only a reflection of the almost universal negative public reaction and perhaps the fact that adonis did not act publicly before . so if somebody thinks , to quote these statements is a hat ched job , he is wrong . the job if there is one - is done by the media - almost unitary . that is why even [ wiki link : edward davey ] , a political rival , is \" . claiming that adonis has been \" unfairly portrayed in the press \" [ ] it is not wikipedias job to hide the fact of the mainly negative ( or neutral ) and little positive coverage . and biased reporting is not biased writing of wikipedia articles , which is of course not our aim . finally , since two years nobody has added quotation of favourable press articles apart from a recent attempt to introduce a unsourced general statement in a speech at the house of lords . so , please , in this case , rethink your pov charge on sourced media criticism . : please [ wiki link : wp : sign your posts ] . npov is n't just about this or that fact being allowed - it is also about the balance of the article . it is fair enough to record significant criticism of the individual - but , on the whole , we should recording the facts . that article was a compilation of criticism and negative media coverage and nothing much more . give a couple of examples of the criticism and give a couple of sources , fine - but not that . we should be working towards have ing an article that both baron adonis and his fier cest critic would see as a fair account of his life , significance , and impact . i do not think that is you agenda . g you might be mistaken : i am not responsible for the whole article . still , i ca n't follow you : it 's not the aim of wikipedia to balance an article so that at the end even osama ben laden would see his one as fair . if a person activities and beliefs are not balanced wikipedia will not counter balance ' the facts . so , if there is overwhelmingly negative or neutral press coverage we should firstly not neglect that . secondly , the biography of a political person has to refer to press articles , if they reflect the political background of that person which is otherwise not approachable . most of the cited articles are written by well known journalists of reputable newspapers . they can be used to lighten the political background as long as we do find better statements . so , it is fair to report that many reputable sources come to the conclusion that adonis is seen as not pure labour , gives rise to some contradictions towards elitism , is accused of being heavily involved in some severe undemocratic operations , is asked to dismiss from his post and is himself realising that he will not survive the change of leader - all facts you deleted . of course , some people might mistake the quotation of these facts as unfair . : . march ( utc ) where can i find your otrs - number ? by the way , i have no political agenda . stop becoming personal . : march ( utc ) about the rand book criticism like you , i agree that we need to have a high degree of accuracy in articles and that statements regarding living persons must be sourced carefully . the only reason i reverted is that there were specific quotes from books listed , and i was unclear as to why they were removed . were the direct book quotes in footnote ( the material in question ) inaccurate , or was only the interpretation ( \" mimi glad stein argues rand 's characters are flat and uninteresting \" ) wrong ? if the latter , then a good compromise might be to include only actual quotes from prominent published criticisms . in any case , in the interests of editing peace , i will discuss such issues on talk pages in the future before reverting . : ok thanks . the problem was not with the direct quotes in the footnote . it was with the allegation that glad stein had described the characters as ' flat and uninteresting ' . if you want to put the directly quoted material back , i have no objections . g [ wiki link : wikipedia : requests for arbitration betacommand ] hello , an arbitration case in which you commented has been opened : [ wiki link : wikipedia : requests for arbitration betacommand ] . please add any evidence you may wish the arbitrators to consider to the evidence sub -

      "he did not take great pains with their ed uc ations . i find it hard to believe that godwin did n't take pains over the childrens ' education : after all , he and his wife were highly educated themselves and wrote books for children . and the proof of the pudding was in the eating , because mary shelley was able to write a remarkable novel at eighteen ( and pursue a literary career , as was intended all along ) and claire clair mont earned a living as a languages teacher and translator . there is an article by betty bennett in the cambridge companion which shows that godwin was systematically educating the girls in letter writing : when he was in ireland , \" along with kisses , godwin sent his daughters assignments that closely associated reading and writing skills with letter - writing \" ( p . ) . and he wrote to james marshall , \" i hope you have got fanny a proper spelling book . have you examined her at all , and discovered what improvement she has made in her reading ? \" he also asked the children to follow his route home on maps . it may be true that he did n't follow mary wollstonecraft 's system and that he has been quoted being dismissive , but it strikes me that these children were very privileged in their education , however unconventional . seymour says : \" asked by an in qui si tive lady correspondent , mrs fordham , whether he was using his late wife 's educational system , he snapped that he and mrs godwin lacked time for novel methods . his answer was misleading : everything we know about his daughter 's early years suggests that she was being taught in a way of which her mother would have approved \" ( p . , i have the , john murray edition ) . incidentally , seymour hints that the spelling book was a sign that fanny imlay was slow ; on the other hand , it seems ( mrs godwin mentioned this in a letter ) that she was good at drawing . : * according to todd , claire received a different education from fanny and mary ( i tried to make this clear in the article ) . claire was sent to a boarding school in kent for three months and in wal ham green for months . mary went to a school in ram s gate for six months - according to todd , this was primarily for health reasons . fanny 's schooling was negligible . todd does acknowledge that the girls were taught art and music . todd takes the godwin quote you refer to above seriously ( - ) . i remember the spelling book incident from somewhere in todd as well - i think she interprets it differently , though . i think she writes about how old fanny was to be taught spelling and how this was evidence of godwin 's negligence . all i can really say is that the primary biography of fanny imlay interprets this evidence differently and i tried to follow the major source in this article ( i have a feeling we are going to run into a lot of this . ) i have yet to finish looking through all of the other biographies , but obviously i will add these other interpretations when i come across them . ) i have done this already in several sections , such as \" death \" . : do n't forget , the suggestion that claire clair mont was educated at the expense of fanny imlay and mary shelley derives originally from the testimony of mary 's son , through ke gan paul . it 's an important source , but not the only one , and should be balanced , surely . seymour gives a number of details about the educational atmosphere in the household . in the cambridge companion on pages and there is similar material . it 's true that the children were occasionally sent off to different schools or environments , but their main education was received at home . * seymour is so thorough in gathering every scrap of information that a conventional view of mrs godwin , and to a lesser extent , of william godwin , being problematic parents , is necessarily mud died . she certainly provides evidence of people hating mrs godwin , but there were others who liked her , so i 'm not sure about \" godwin 's friends despised clair mont , finding her vulgar and dishonest \" : not all of them . one has to evaluate the sources of the vitriol a little here , i suspect ( i 'm trying to do my historian bit and gauge bias in the primary commentary ) : charles and mary lamb , for example , are not the most psychologically sound people in that circle , and my first instinct is to recoil from the language they used to vili fy mrs godwin . and one has to take into account that those who worshipped william godwin or mary w , such as place or eliza fen wick , might have felt a natural jealousy towards mrs godwin ; james marshall had been living with godwin and had to move out when mary clair mont moved in . mary shelley 's own testimony may be coloured by the way the god wins treated her after her involvement with shelley : the evidence from the childhood time itself does not seem to me conclusive of faulty parenting at all . seymour quotes voices in favour , as do gi ttings and man ton : burr called mrs godwin \" a sensible , ami able woman \" and \" a charming lady \" ( gi ttings and man ton , ) . and then there is fanny imlay herself : i sense a tendency in the article and in the books to imply that she was constrained or suppressed in some way by the god wins ; but she may have genuinely agreed with the position taken by the god wins and got on with them : there is evidence for that , for example in the letter she sent telling her sister off : \" ' i understand from ma mma that i am your laughing stock and the constant beacon for your { } satire ' . mrs godwin can be blamed for being un kindly in v en tive , but it is revealing that fanny believed her . \" ( letter of may , , seymour , ) . i 'm not saying that the other view is wrong , merely that it might need balancing . : * i think we have to be careful not to distort the published sources . they may have o vere mph asi zed one element or another and that is too bad , but it is not our job to fix that . i think that it is pretty clear that they say that \" godwin 's friends \" despised the new mrs . godwin ( owen was not exactly a friend , for example ) . i worry about or creeping in with these types of things and that is one of the best policies wikipedia has . you have no idea how many things i have wanted to tweak in the articles about eighteenth - century children 's literature . however , there is absolutely no published material that backs me up , so i ca n't . the articles must go on stating things that are ridiculous or misleading . ) however , without a combination of [ wiki link : wp : v ] and [ wiki link : wp : or ] , wikipedia would be the \" wild west \" , as once said . : i am not suggesting we introduce original thought by removing information but that we balance that information , in accordance with the policies you mention . \" godwin 's friends despised clair mont , finding her vulgar and dishonest \" is not fully accurate , given that some of his friends did not despise her , for which there is evidence . * i wonder if the article could use a description of som ers town and the oc tag on , to help evoke her childhood environment . is there a picture somewhere ? : * there is a picture in todd 's book , but i have n't been able to find a good copy . scanning it from a book seems like degradation hell . do you know how to do these things ? : i have a scanner but can never get the pages to lie down properly . the picture in seymour is very small . * i felt the need for time and age markers in places . the lead takes us very quickly from the arrival of mrs godwin to fanny imlay being left behind . and i lost my bearings in the following : however , gilbert imlay tired of wollstonecraft and domestic life [ ] and broke off the relationship , but only after it had dragged on for two more painful years and wollstonecraft had attempted suicide twice . [ ] in she traveled to scandinavia , taking the one - year - old imlay with her , in an effort to solve some of gilbert 's business difficulties and resurrect their relationship , but to no avail . we do have markers , but they clash , and the place of the journey in the timeline of the relationship becomes blurred , in my opinion . : * i have revised the lead . some of this material has been removed because i felt it more applicable to mw than fi . i added some dates and ages . see what you think . : yes , that 's much better . * i felt the suicide attempt by the bridge should be mentioned and placed in relation to fanny imlay 's age at the time . mary w 's suicide attempts are mentioned in a caption but not in the main text ; but in view of her daughter 's fate , they might be included to advantage in the article . i felt the same about fanny imlay 's de pres siveness : the article does mention ke gan paul 's view that she inherited de pres siveness from her mother ( gi ttings and man ton make this point too ) , but little more is said about the de pres siveness of either , though that is surely a key to fanny imlay and there are quotations that allude to this . ( we do hear about lone liness and there are other hints . ) : * i was unsure whether to dwell on mw 's suicides . i originally had planned to include them , but then i thought they were irrelevant to fi 's life story . i have now expanded this - i basically just \" stole \" stuff from the [ wiki link : mary wollstonecraft ] article . ) the reason i de - emphasized the depression is because todd does . she does n't focus on it until the end of fanny 's life . : that definitely helps . there are references to fanny 's mental state available , for example the one from claire clair mont 's letter that i quoted in the thread up the page . * perhaps burr and owen require a phrase of introduction . : * done ( i hope burr is n't too inflammatory ) . : fine . * times cale for burr , in relation to fanny imlay 's age , is n't clear . i cut , since it seemed too early for that sort of conversation . : * oops - i was looking at the wrong paragraph . added . : fine . * in , he asked if imlay , the daughter of his hero , mary wollstonecraft , could join him , his new wife , and her sister . what does \" join him \" mean there ? : * come live with him . changed . : oh , i see . * she criticized shelley 's in sensitivity to class divides . i 'm not sure what is meant there . : * shelley liked to act as if class was irrelevant , but she argued that it was significant . how best to express this without being wordy ? : i think what you just said is better . in what way did imlay think class was significant ? the cause of oppression ? * do we know where she went in wales ? : * no - there is massive speculation in todd based on one word in godwin 's diary . i thought it best to leave all of that out . * godwin agreed to accept , from shelley . we have just been told that shelley was also in debt , so how did he manage this ? or was it just a promise ? : * have you read yet about the nightmare that was shelley 's finances ? ah ! as shelley was an ari sto crat , he could borrow against his future inheritance - up to a point . but something about his father still being alive and shelley himself having a wife ( with a possible heir ) all comes into it as well . it is all very confusing . at one point he promised godwin the money and then he gets godwin the money - but there are long delays and hass les . also , godwin 's name is never on the money , until later when shelley wants to insult him . ( : * i have tried to explain this in the footnote as best as i can for the moment . i 'm not sure how many details to go into . : the complications are clearer now . ) * by the time they tracked her to swansea . it 's not clear that this took two days . : * added \" on the th \" . : fine . * the article merely says that godwin wrote that h us hing - up letter to shelley , and this is mary shelley . i know it is difficult to distinguish the two effectively ( see comments in above thread ) . : * according to todd , the letter was written to percy shelley . added to article . : interesting . both seymour and spark say it was addressed to mary shelley . * should there be an explanation of why william godwin and the sh el leys covered the death up ? perhaps not all readers will understand the disgrace attached to suicide in those days . : * good idea : added : because suicide was considered scandalous , dis reputable , and sinful at the time , the family told various stories regarding imlay 's death in order to cover up the truth . - do you think this is enough ? : fine . * todd 's theory about her seeing the sh el leys in bath may need balancing more strongly with other versions . i do n't buy it myself : we might think of the sh el leys and william godwin as almost like characters in a novel , but i can not believe that all three of them ( or just the first two ) would have kept quiet about a meeting like that . and if they were keeping quiet , percy shelley would not have ris ked being found out through the poems . though they did not identify the body , they wrote to each other about it ; so surely they would have written to someone about any last meeting with her . seymour and gi ttings man ton have more straightforward accounts of the circumstances surrounding fanny imlay 's death . seymour however differs in saying that mw 's sisters had just been in london and had left , after finding that some of their rents supervised by godwin had ev ap or ated ; she suggests that they had become prejudiced against employing fanny imlay . but why would she then go to swansea , the port for dublin ? godwin says that going to dublin was \" a thing that had been in contemplation \" : but clearly , this had n't been properly planned , with family packing , etc . i ca n't believe that she would go to ireland without preparing properly ; i suppose she was simply in a confused state and that there 's a limit to what explanation is possible . i wish we knew what she meant by \" those persons who have hurt their health in ende av oring to promote her welfare \" . i 'm not aware of anything like that in her life : but the documentation on her seems decidedly puny . : * i plan to do a bit more balancing after i manage to get the other biographies . however , since todd 's is the only biography on fanny imlay , i think it does deserve some emphasis as a source for this article . again , i 'm not sure it matters what we think of the evidence . that said , i think that the evidence is too scant to make any of these theories more solid than any of the others . i tried to emphasize that shelley 's poems , on which todd relies , are sc ra ps - they really are . they are do od lings on a scratch piece of paper . also , it seems that all of the actors in this drama lied about a great deal throughout their lives and it is difficult to tell what happened at any point in their lives . : on the contrary , i think it does matter what we think about the evidence , since it is our job to alert the readers when sources disagree . todd suggests that fanny imlay may have met percy shelley in bath , de lu dedly wanting to live with him and mary . there is no evidence for this . and it goes against what we know of the relations between fanny and the sh el leys at that time : for example , on the th , she had written acc us ingly to mary shelley about gossip : \" . and this you ch use to fa sten upon ma mma . \" . she went on to insist on their sending godwin money , \" . and it is not your and shelley 's duty to consider these things ? \" this seems to me hardly a moment in which she would descend on bath to live with them . as far as the lying goes , it is possible . but we would have to believe that mary shelley manipulated her own diary and that claire ( who was with her when the letter arrived ) agreed on the cover up , or that percy shelley failed to tell her that he had met fanny imlay in bath that day , and that fanny had somehow arranged a meeting with him without mary knowing . it does n't add up , in my opinion . however , we also have st clair 's theory in the article ( i note that spark agrees with seymour that the aunt thing had stalled ) , and i expect this will all balance out before long . * seymour has an extraordinary detail about fanny imlay 's death . she says ( p . ) that the newspaper mentioned that the young lady 's stays were em bro ide red with the initials \" mw \" . i wonder if she had deliberately worn those in memory of her mother , or did she usually wear them ? her few possessions also apparently included a little swiss gold watch . this can be traced to a watch that the sh el leys had bought her in geneva . god , this is sad .

      "hello goo dd amon , mostly due to holidays and my semester start , i am first answering now . me ( td ) : the point i hope to make here , is that i dont care what the cos or any authority , critic , or anybody else say the subjects are , but that i do care they are presented exactly as they are . one ca n't discuss , c ri ti size , use or improve anything without having the actual thing first . agree ? you ( gd ) : surprisingly , no . as a writer and as a developer , i have to be able to con c ep tu alize things that i do n't have . for instance , i do n't need to physically have a div tag to imagine how i might use one to , for instance , encapsulate a tex ta rea field so i can resize the field however i need to . i 'm a pretty imaginative guy , so i can learn from abstracts pretty easily . td : by thing i rather meant whatever exists or is conceived to exist as a separate entity or as a distinct and individual quality , fact , or idea a separable or distinguishable object of thought ( mir ri am webster . ) the div tag and your abstract ( concept ) . i meant that we can not handle some thing that doesnt exist in the real world and that i would like to see dn presented as it exists , not as people ( again , any people ) say that it exists . the wiki - article really describes a thing that doesnt exist it does not give a reliable representation of it , so that it correctly understood , handled and c ri ti sized , but it presents an already c ri ti sized , warped thing by the same name . such a thing does not belong in any encyclopedia . whether the authors were or were not scientologists should not matter . what does matter is whether they have studied the subject scientifically . to become truly educated on a subject and take the responsibility to transmit it to others , one has to study it exactly as stated and only then form his own opinions . and one mus n't allow the authority of any person or school of thought to create a fo reg one conclusion in his sf ere of knowledge . the present wiki - rendition of the subject is not an example of that at all . what can we do about it ? td : that may or may not be feasible with ( a system of ) beliefs , but i swear by all the de am ons i know , good and bad , that there is no belief in dn , and for what i know , none in sc either . i changed \" patient \" into \" p rec lear \" , because dn and sc are definitely not for patients or people in such a condition . also , the word clear was mentioned in the article before and most readers who succeed in reading further than that will have had enough schooling to see the logic in pre clear . gd : i 'm not sure i understand you . dianetics is n't a science as science is usually defined , and discusses unscientific ideas ( such as \" en grams \" ) . it might be characterized as a component of a religion or as a series of philosophical and mental exercises , but you certainly believe in it , do n't you ? it 's a matter of faith , the same as with any other religion . there 's no scientific evidence for buddhist reincarnation , or taoist enlightenment , but devotees of both religions believe in them . as for \" patient \" and \" p rec lear , \" the term is defined elsewhere in the series of articles on dianetics and scientology , in more logically appropriate places . be careful that you 're not duplicating things that are already there ! td : you are identifying two things that are essentially different : dn is a cy tology ( cell research ) based science of structure entirely inside then know able field . it doesnt deal with spiritualism , deism , telepathy or like scientology , about the human soul . only one thing in scientology is about faith , and that is one 's own faith or religion if he has one . \" science \" means only \" truth \" being derived from the latin word \" sci o \" which is \" knowing in the fullest sense of the word \" ; \" science \" infers an organization of knowledge : the materials of sc , which concern the human soul , are based on critically observational knowledge and being organized , certainly meets the criteria of \" scientific \" knowledge . td : about hubbard re discovering : i meant that dn and sc are not new , but what is done with the data is new . hubbard already writes in the original thesis pg : \" . almost any of its parts can be found somewhere in history . \" that the discoveries have been around is the evidence , right ? so if \" all other sources say \" he created it , do n't they contradict themselves ? ( be careful with \" all \" , check for example some scholastic studies ) this reminds me of an important reversion : i had included the latest publication of that book , because all former pubs ( also most other dn and sc books ) are incomplete , perverted and unreliable . why was it reverted ? gd : well , that 's the problem . hubbard says this , but we ca n't use him as a reliable source . i really recommend reading that wikipedia policy , by the way . it will help explain a lot of what i 've been saying . the fact that hubbard says they \" can be found somewhere in history \" does n't make it true , at least not by wikipedia policy . that 's the kind of statement that has to be fact - checked by a news organization or by reputable scholarly reviews before it could be incorporated into an article . and dianetics itself ca n't be used as a source for information about it , unless we 're pulling a specific quote from the book . per wikipedia : reliable sources : \" wikipedia articles should use reliable , third - party , published sources . \" td : when i wrote things i assumed you were knowledgeable in the subject and had recognized the information elsewhere in your process of verifying them . td you were puzzled by \" symbolic sound codes \" ? just sounds sym bo li zing m est ( matter , energy , space , time ) , i . e words . necessary realization for under stan ing p ren atal \" memory \" , as the fetus doesnt generally speak english before birth , but afterwards , when he has learned some , he can \" unconsciously \" de code the sounds ( when similar per c ep tic keys are there ) , and get the pain in that \" memory \" . dn is about pain , not about memory , you know . gd : and that 's the kind of thing right there that non - scientologists ca n't understand at all . i 'll try to break it all down for you , and again , please do n't take offense at this , because it 's going to sound like i 'm attacking your beliefs , when i 'm really not . i really was confused by \" symbolic sound codes , \" and every non - scientologist you meet would also be confused by it . it 's an overly - complicated way to say \" words . \" to us , it 's similar to saying \" rapid energetic oxidation accompanied by excessive heat \" when you mean \" fire . \" there is no scientific basis for the belief that people can remember the sounds they heard before knowing how to speak , de code those sounds into words , and then be haunted by those sounds later in life . i 'm not saying that it 's impossible , just that there is no evidence for it . believing in it is fine , but you must accept that to non - scientologists , it very much appears to be a religious belief . it ca n't be proven true . td : we are not discussing the neighbour , but a precise subject with precise terms . so it 's more like this : in early life , before sound is analyzed as ape ech , a human being receives and stores exact impressions of everything which occurs . at some future date , when similar per c ep tics are encountered , the reactive mind re - analyzes on the basis of identities only - the content of the early mind . ( from : the original thesis , ch . ) td : \" cellular memory trace \" , a religious belief ? ! goo dd amon , give me a break , religion is about spirits , not cells . gd : not necessarily . religion would be about any series of beliefs or preconceived notions supported by faith . are you familiar with cargo cults ? these are third - world cults that develop around the belief that the devices and skills shown by westerners are mystical . td : i dont know of any such notions . could you provide me with some examples ? td : my th edit should be unscientific and un medical ? merriam webster 's definition of eng ram : a memory trace ; specifically : a pro top las mic change in neural tissue hypothesized to account for the persistence of memory . international scientific lingo . gd : you 're conflating hubbard 's definition of \" eng ram \" with the scientific definition . in scientific studies of neurology , an \" eng ram \" is a ( quoting merriam - webster myself here ) \" a hypothetical change in neural tissue postulated in order to account for persistence of memory . \" one important distinction is that the neuro sciences do not share hubbard 's belief that an eng ram could be wiped out , nor that they were any cause of misery . they 're just the changes in brain tissue that happen when a memory is stored . of en grams , hubbard wrote , \" it is a recording in the reactive mind of something which actually happened to an individual in the past and which contained pain and un consciousness . \" however , the scientific understanding of en grams is that they 're all memories , good , bad , and indifferent . they 're just a way to describe how the brain records experiences . td : one doesnt need neuroscience to know that certain memories cause misery . then , en grams are n't wiped out , but develop ped , discharged and made into an ordinary ( accessible ) memory . td : but no bad vi bs , allright . as to conflicts of interest : i am not a scientologist , but a student of scientology . scientologist is a title i and many others will be mighty proud of one day . the more one gets to be one , the more pan - determined he can be , like a chess - master . it 's a wise investment too , cause next lifetime i can start out early , like child prodigy samuel rz es che wski , prob l ably past life clear . just trying you . gd : to non - members of your church , you are a scientologist . again , please do n't take offense at that . it 's just that from the outside , we do n't make such distinctions . those of us who have an interest in it understand that there are various levels of scientology p rec lear , operating the tan , and so on but even to us , you appear to be fully invested in your beliefs , making you a scientologist . even if the ones you call scientologists would n't call you one . also , i have to point out that belief in past lives and future lives is a spiritual belief , further reducing the scientific credibility of dianetics . td : you mean people can read it on my forehead ? even if they could , the offense is not in being a scientologist , but that many people are kept from knowing what it is and read something else . otherwise , your inside - outside approach reminds me of religions that dont cooperate with other religions and so actually work against themselves and an eventual brotherhood of man , the basic meaning of the word religion being \" to tie fast or bind together by trust \" . as an editor , you should make distinctions , such as that past lives do not relate to dn . and that a student of sc is one who is studying textbooks in an organization or on an extension course , and is not a p rec lear , nor ne cess a rely doing c oun selling levels , such as the levels to war de clear . knowing but a fraction of dn and sc , i can only point out the way for you towards an edit that isnt a disgrace . td : \" you will have to accept things that you know with absolute certainty are wrong or twisted by critics of the church of scientology \" does this mean , that should those things be found in a different light in analyses by reputed scholars in the fields of religion , social sciences , etc , such as urban o a gal an , doctor in philosophy and lic en ciate in theology , at gregorian university and saint bon av en ture pon ti fical faculty rome , or michael a . si ver tse v , expert advisor on international matters to the committee of the russian federation , to name a few reputable sources , that light can not shine in wikipedia ? you still did n't tell me why their external links and pdfs were removed . gd : because they were links to a church of scientology - owned website . if instead those pdfs were hosted at universities or in peer - reviewed publications , they might be acceptable for certain things . for instance , urban o a . gal an 's paper argues that scientology is a religion , and might be used to strengthen the argument that it is one . but it would need to be hosted at a non - church website . and now that i 've checked , michael a . si ver tse v 's work would n't be acceptable in any way . he works for and is a member of the church of scientology . the church of scientology ca n't be used as a source for the same reason you ca n't argue that the bible is accurate with quotations from the bible . it 's circular logic . td : these are not quo ti ations but analyses by people who can le gi tim ally write about it , simply because they have scientifically studied the subject . where is the circular logic ? td : \" you 'll need to recognize and accept that scientology is not well - regarded by non - members . on the outside , it is largely considered a cult . \" as i said before , i am not interested in opinions but in actual viewpoints ( results from having looked ) , such as presented in analytical studies of dn and sc . do n't you think these scholars should be referred to in wikipedia ? : james a . beck ford . ph . d , prof sociology ( scientology , social science and the definition of religion ) , per - ar ne berg lie , prof history and religion ( scientology , comparison with religions of the east and west ) , allan w black , associate prof of sociology ( is scientology a religion ?

( tao dep tus ( talk ) ) gd : frankly , i 'm astonished . i checked quite a few of the names on your list , and every single one of them works for and is a member of the church of scientology . not a single one of them is from outside the organization . so in other words , no . none of them can be used , except as sources for what the church of scientology says about itself . none of what they write can be quoted as fact , because they have built - in conflicts of interest . you would have to strip out all the names of members of your church and use only sources that really are independent of the church . td : you surely know many people . it is highly esteemed by people high and low . anybody who hasnt been in sti lled with preconceived beliefs about it and then studies it , regards dn as the science of mind and sc as a practical religion , not a cult . i do n't find any such relations . which names have you checked ? ! gd : i really do hope you do n't take offense at anything i 've written here , but i felt i owed it to you to be frank . no scientists accept anything hubbard said or wrote as scientifically factual . that 's not to say you ca n't believe in him if you choose . \" what 's true is what 's true for you , \" as he would say . but you must accept that , as far as everyone outside your religion is concerned , those beliefs are based on faith , not fact . goo dd amon td : do n't worry about that . naturally . science is solidly stuck on and with a falsehood in the field of the mind : that man is an animal based on chemistry ( a theory that grew up in a rev ul sion against the control by religion of men 's faith . ) and at the same time it develops a new unworkable psychology to back up the exact science of blowing up the planet . what is true for you is what you have observed yourself . loo kin gness has always been a very high state . fear of \" no thin gness \" a low one . by the way , why was my addition of the last publication of the original thesis reverted ? the publication in the wiki - article is not reliable . same counts for the rest of the basic books . tao dep tus\n",

or talk wikipedia up to others ? i really ca n't think of a way to help , other than actual editing , that would require you to keep a username from which you never made an edit , and to which you did n't even sign in for more than days at a time . strong oppose . there are many valid reasons to have accounts with no edits ; to keep your preferences , to have an alternate watchlist , to have the same username on several projects ( there are people with accounts on all the wikipedias ) , to reserve a username ( like and the doppelganger usernames ) , and so on . just because someone has not logged in in a while , it does not mean he should lose his account . and emailing the owner of the accounts is n't enough ; we have accounts without an email address , unconfirmed email addresses , dead email addresses ( some people forget to change it when they change isps ) , agressive spam filters , broken email servers , and so on . oppose i really do appreciate what you 're trying to accomplish here , and it took me awhile to decide my vote , but in the end , in actual practice it does n't seem to serve a useful purpose . all that vandals sockpuppets will have to do is make one \" legitimate \" edit with their fake account and the account is safe for future use . meanwhile , legitimate users who , for whatever reasons , register and then not edit , risk losing their account . and of the , zero - edit accounts , how many were purely unused , and how many were simply d op pel gang ers ? plus , i imagine the number of unregistered vandal - user edits far outweighs the number of \" stale \" accounts , so the time resources needed to pull this off seems a low priority in my opinion . : there are ways to mark [ wiki link : wikipedia : doppelganger account doppelganger accounts ] , which requires making an edit to the account 's userpage . and since an edit was made to the page , the account can no longer be deleted . while anonymous edits by unregistered users may be a problem , this is just as much a problem . oppose days is too short , once i had an eye injury and c ou l dent read , use the computer , or watch the tv for months : two months is only days . days is months and the proposed days is months . i do not see what is so complicated about that . i know it may be hard to see that sometimes , but wanted to clarify that . : strongly support ! about deleting blocked accounts . some editors have expressed reservations about deleting blocked accounts . i think that blocked accounts that meet the other criteria set forth above should be deleted . the concern is that deleting the account will leave the original creator free to recreate the account in an unblocked form . the vast majority of accounts that are blocked have been blocked precisely because of edits made under those accounts ; such accounts do not fall under this policy . the only way that an account gets blocked without ever having made any edits is if the username itself is highly offensive , an imposter , or uses a pattern of a known vandal , such as \" on wheels \" or \" is communism \" . the creators of such accounts are generally well aware that these accounts will be blocked immediately , and are not making long - term plans to use them . after days , the creator would likely have long forgotten that it had ever existed . if the creator would be inclined to recreate the same account ( surely only to be blocked again ) , this policy would not affect their ability to create an account with a nearly identical username , by having five exclamation points at the end instead of four , for example , or any number of other n once variations . thus , deleting these accounts offers no additional convenience to vandals whatsoever , as they can always create an account with a marginally different name . however , enacting this deletion policy will provide us with the great benefit of erasing many stupid and offensive usernames from the rolls of our user list . i therefore implore the community not to impose any limitation on the application of this policy based solely on the blocked status of an account to be deleted under it . cheers ! : actually , this strikes me as a good reason to keep blocked accounts : once we 've blocked \" on wheels \" , which we will do every time it 's created , we need never block it again ( and taking the effort to create it and failing may discourage the next vandal , which would be a [ wiki link : good thing ] . ) since an account with zero edits should be blocked only for inappropriate user name , this is , i think , the only question . : my point is , if we do n't delete these accounts , they stay in our database , and the vandal ( if inclined to make trouble ) simply takes the same amount of effort to make a slightly different offensive username . in short , if we do n't delete the account , we 'll end up having to block a different one , and will only increase the number of such perma blocked accounts in our database . besides , after days , hopefully that vandal will have found better things to do than bother wikipedia with offensive username registrations . however , i 'd be open to some compromise - suppose we agree to start with the oldest accounts first , as there are some never - used vandal accounts who have been blocked for years . knock out all unused blocked accounts that are more than a year old , and talk about proceeding with the rest after that is done . : i 'd be willing to simply add a note , commenting that there may be reasons to leave some blocked accounts , like and , in existence and perma blocked ; these may be as numerous as the indef - blocked attack accounts . : same rationale for deletion still applies . if vandalized and was blocked , the account can not be deleted ; if made an account but got blocked without ever having edited ( either because they never got the chance to make an edit or because they never intended to do so ) , i think it fairly safe to presume that days on , the creator of the account will have forge tten it ever existed , and will not go looking to re - create it in order to vandalize from it . furthermore , if the vandal does want to vandalize , he can just as easily create or . by leaving the account , we impose no extra work on vandals , but merely keep our list of users clogged up with nonsense . single login do n't know if this was mentioned before but would n't it be han di er to do this after single login is implemented ? many users on another wiki ( commons , foreign language etc ) made an account here to protect their name . and from what i 've heard single login does look now like it will be there in the foreseeable future . : wo n't such users want to trash all the individual accounts in exchange for a single login account then ? i concede , i 've made accounts on other wiki 's which i virtually never edit in order to protect this username . perhaps once this is implemented , we can have a notice posted on the other wikimedia projects for a short time to alert editors that old , unused wikipedia addresses are getting deleted , and the way to save them is to make an edit from them . : i assume there will be a way to join accounts . if so , then it would be better imo to wait till single login is implemented . it does n't seem that this proposal has to be implemented in a hurry anyway . it can wait ca n't it ? see also [ wiki link : meta : communications sub committees press pr sul this press draft ] . i saw referring to it recently . : well , i 'm not sure this proposal would affect anything for people who have cross - namespace usernames . either their old account will get booted for non use , or will get sucked into the new one . i presume that the single user account will not be deleted if there 's a single edit from it on any of the projects , but i also do n't want to hold my breath waiting for it to come about . my immediate concern is eliminating the unused offensive and insulting usernames created as a one - time gag . those should never be recast as single - user accounts either . : the only thing which could happen i think is that for instance the german equivalent ( famous admin name needed hmm ) tony sidaway has an empty account here , which he could lose if someone else registers it after the cleanup and makes a few minor edits on it . therefore making the account impossible to use for the german user . i have to admit that this scenario is not that likely to happen , but still . : there should be enough time so that he 'd be able to log into it for a certain amount of time , or make an edit to per serve the account . he came here to preserve his account by making it , i 'm sure he can come here to per serve it by logging in every so often or making an edit . : having a notice posted at every wiki project for a few weeks before we start deleting accounts should be enough to cover that concern ( although i 'd give obvious vandal attack accounts and inappropriate usernames no grace period ) . : all the obvious vandal and attack ac ounts of course can definitely be deleted . with all the other ones i still think it 's better to wait , just to be on the safe side . there 's no real hurry . : hm . how about if there was a way to check if the same username is registered on another project ? that way , we could immediately ( ) knock out the vandal attack accounts , and ( ) knock out unused no - edit accounts for which the name exists only on en . wikipedia ( which there must be a lot of , because my understanding is that en . wikipedia has orders of magnitude more accounts registered than any other wiki project ) . : it would be great if that 's possible . is there such a way ? : is n't there always ? i have great faith in the ability of technology to provide the solution ! : there 's [ external link : interiot 's single user login conflict checker ] but it 's pretty ( understandably ) slow . born h ji 'm thinking also about the scale of this undertaking . we 're talking here about deleting well over half a million never - used accounts - i doubt that can be done overnight . if we op ti mis tically say we 're going to delete , per day ( or one every seconds ) , it will take more than a month to knock out those that exist as of now . we must determine if we can set a priority order - the first thing to go should be any account that includes an obvious vulgarity or attack in the username , and once those are done we isolate those usernames that are unique to en . wikipedia and do knock them out in chronological order , deleting those longest unused first . perhaps we can introduce some other qualifiers like length of username or number of exclamation points ! ; - ) just a note : deleting usernames with or more edits . can not happen due to legal reasons . please read the [ wiki link : gfdl ] . sigh . : yes . that already was discussed here and on the project page though . : indeed , that is not what this proposal is about . implement ? this proposal has been voted on for days now , does anyone know when it is scheduled to end as there is virtually no opposition - with nearly a hundred and fi fe ty users voting in support and a mere opposing votes . just wondering .

' [ wiki link : special : emailuser lcarsdata ] ' : , [ wiki link : july ] [ wiki link : ] ( utc ) just one more point does the one edit count even if the person made the edit to their own userpage ? in that case , would something like be deleted since the user has only made one edit ever ? : just to clarify : conservative joe 's user page was deleted just recently . : two points - first , any edit to any page counts - this is a software limitation , not merely a policy matter , as unattributed edits can not exist ; second , it does not matter if the edited page is deleted , the edit still exists in the database ( and is viewable by admins ) . all - encompassing note in order to sa ti si fy everything about the gfdl and all : * no edits * no deleted edits * no oversight hidden edits * no log activity , except for new user . * no otherwise hidden log activity . in other words , there should be nothing about a user in any of the [ wiki link : special : log logs ] except for the username being created , including any otherwise hidden . the basic premise ? they can have done nothing that ended up on wikipedia for any amount of time except for being a new user . in this way , the original intention of ' unused ' is completely upheld . anything less will probably get tossed out . unused period there still seems to be a fairly arbitrary attitude to what the cutoff period should be , despite the proposal title of days . i wondering , is it possible to produce cumulative frequency statistics on how long accounts concerned by this policy have been idle ? that would give a more informed insight on how long or short to set it . i also still want to see a server admin say that this whole process will do the servers that much good . dissing the gis ? as a gi who occasionally spends seasons ' away from anything remotely resembling internet access , i find this topic - and the percentage of those who apparently approve of the proposition - discouraging . : please realize that this proposition is n't the slightest bit prejudiced against gis , or any other group . as discussed several times above and below , any user who makes any edit , even just posting a single comment here ( as you 've already done ) ensures that their username will never be deleted . this is a matter of both technical and legal requirements which can never be changed . the only accounts subject to deletion are the ones that have never made a single edit anywhere on wikipedia , and also have n't logged in within the past days . so if a gi ( or anybody else ) wants to ensure their account remains reserved even if they unexpectedly get kept away from the internet for an extended period of time , they just have to make a single comment ( like the one you just made , or even just on their on user page ) and they 're safe . : just make an edit to an article as soon as you make a username . that will cover it , and only takes seconds - paradox has it occured to anyone that no one who will be affected by this proposal has ( or even can ) vote on this page ? : well , yes , but if you never edited at all , why would you want to vote ? basically this should not effect anyone , as all these accounts are stale , and would never have made any edits . : isnt that a good thing ? by voting here , people no longer fall under the cater ogy of inactive users , both ensuring their page 's survival and showing that they actually check what is going on in the wp community - : but if there is a valid reason that people get accounts and then ca n't edit with them , there is no way to find out about it . though there probably is n't one , i just thought it was an odd paradox : um , if you ca n't edit with your account , then you do n't need one ( and wikipedia does n't need you to have one ) . as my contracts professor would say , do n't lose sight , do n't lose sight of the fact that accounts exist only as a mechanism to assist users in improving wikipedia . true , we 're building an encyclopedia for the world , but anyone can read ' wikipedia , account or no . an account is only of use if an editor is using it to make improvements . votes over people have supported this now . is there any deadline to this , and does any developer actually know about this ? if not , someone should tell them . ) * i reposted this on community portal exactly a week ago with the ultimate motive of hitting votes . i was going to post a short about it on the administrator 's noticeboard or similar , but now i think i might leave it up to the original inventor of the policy , . i 'll drop him a line and ask what he thinks .

      "ok - so calm down and take the time to type coherently . there is no urgency here - we can discuss this like civilised human beings - ok ? take a deep breath . : now - you say that \" consensus was reach four to five months before you got here to roughly : feb after frank to bia and bob prime worked with collins ( to get info on device including photos as was submitted at patent office ) . \" - if that 's true then you should be able to find where that consensus debate took place - i do n't see it anywhere . however , wikipedia 's standards for referencing and tolerance for non - referenced statements have changed considerably over the intervening years - and there is no reason not to revise the article accordingly . : what i do see is that the article on f - units was deleted by unanimous ! vote [ wiki link : wikipedia : articles for deletion f - unit ( self - rep lic ator ) ] mostly on the grounds that it was not verifiable and that collins had written it himself ( which is a violation of [ wiki link : wp : nor ] and [ wiki link : wp : coi ] ) . collins is now a banned user and as such we may discount any ' agreement ' made with him . : i do see a debate at which seems to have ended with an agreement to let the afd decide the matter . but i do n't see any open consensus debate there . i also see that was blanked after a rant by an obvious sock of fr aber j collins ( - another . * address ) in april - got the same treatment from the fr aber j collins . this definitely does n't sound like a consensus agreement to me ! : there was discussion of the f - units issue here [ wiki link : talk : self - rep lic ating machine archive . contentious . paragraph ] in april - but i do n't see any clear consensus agreement coming out of that - and the very next thing that happened was collins getting blocked after creating a bunch of socks . : so - there has been no consensus debate . unless you can give us an exact link to one - it might as well not have happened because we are n't going to take your word for it - ok ? i 'm very happy to participate in a consensus debate about what we should or should not say about f - units . let 's do it right here and now though if it will help to calm things down a bit . i have to tell you though that my opening argument will be \" we should remove all references to f - units from this article until unless adequate referencing can be provided . \" - because that 's what wikipedia guidelines tell us we should do . note that neither collins ' web page nor the f - units patent ( s ) are acceptable under wikipedia referencing guidelines . that leaves ( afaik ) just the single paragraph about them in freitas and merkle - which collins himself violently objects to . if we discount freitas and merkle then f - units does n't meet wikipedia notability standards and all reference to them should be removed from this article . if we report only what freitas and merkle says - then f - units are a mere fiction in the head of collins and could justify no more than a footnote to that effect . : i know collins feels very upset with the world and the way it has received his ideas - and perhaps that upset is justified . but wikipedia does not exist to right those kinds of wrongs . we 're here to report facts - and ( by our own rules ) \" facts \" are things we can verify through solid , reliable , recognized sources . not things that one guy with a patent happens to believe . that 's maybe something you find unacceptable - perhaps you even feel it 's a violation of \" free speech \" - but it is how wikipedia operates . wikipedia is a privately owned and operated website and it can ( and does ) set its own editorial rules . and that 's the end of that debate . : what you personally know about technology is not really relevant . what 's relevant for wikipedia is to find independent sources that confer notability . ' : it 's only useful as a primary source . i could go patent my time machine tomorrow . having a patent on something does n't make it notable . my time machine would not be notable unless ( at least ) valid , independent sources talked about it . ' : a video provided by its creator does not make it notable . otherwise , assume i know nothing , and tell me how this \" merkle and freitas \" are both reliable and independent ? ' : a credible video would be an awesome thing to behold . i for one would love to see an f - unit replicate itself on video . wow . that would be earth - shattering . however , sadly , it would count for nothing on wikipedia because it 's not evidence . but if collins can make one of his f - units replicate , then he 's only got to show it happening to some reputable scientists and get them to write about it in ( say ) \" nature \" or \" communications of the acm \" or some other reputable journal - and we 'd be lining up here to write about it . wikipedia is the last place where breaking news is reported . we 're an encyclopedia - we write about things that are already well known - we 're not a newspaper . once the news is all over the scientific press - we 'll be able to write about it . : first off , when you said \" i come here to do things americans ca n't do \" is cont enti os which started such flame war up again after the peace . i do n't see the relevance of this . : i do not know what you and the collins got into before comming here at napster but lets try and keep things civil so that one day china , u . s . and other countries of the world can come together as friends someday instead of enemies . i have no idea what you 're talking about - i 've never used napster . collins is the one being uncivil - just take a look at the talk pages of fr aber j and his socks . but it 's still irrelevant . : do not assume you preach to me about wikipedia policy i know what consensus is around here . excellent - that 'll save a lot of debate . : after feb the article stayed same for the good five months or more , stable consensus until you and collins got in it at the napster or whatever and you deleted his entire article in spite . the fact that an article has been wrong for a long time is no reason not to fix it ! consensus means debating the content of the article and obtaining agreement between editors . that has n't happened . i did not delete his article - that was the decision of the [ wiki link : wp : afd ] process - which is a meticulously fair , consensus - driven process . : nothing to do with here . are you scientist ? i have a degree in [ wiki link : cybernetics ] from the university of kent at canterbury . : that was consensus before that ( look at history sequences on that , you know how ) . i look i see it ! that 's not a \" consensus debate \" - that 's just routine editing . a consensus debate is what i 'm trying to have here . a discussion of content , here on this discussion page . : i watch i see all this . i copy down & keep the notes . debate was finally had to the fact that collins patent is the only patent that a patent examiner has allowed on a \" self - rep lic ating machine \" in its entirety , published in the patent gaze te unlike any others that are only prop sed accessories and \" partial rep lic ators \" . patents are irrelevent . you can patent almost anything . the us patent exam in ers spend an average of minutes per patent . since some patents take them years to investigate - most are completed with little more than a cursory glance . you can patent almost any old crap . the test of a patent only comes if someone in fr ing es it and the owner defends it in court . patents are not acceptable wikipedia verification for any fact other than that a patent was filed and that the owner made some set of claims . sorry - but that patent is utterly worthless as evidence for wikipedia . : in fact someone un k own put it here not collins ( all the old talk has been deleted , i see it is gone and i saw it maliciously deleted ) . nothing here is ever finally \" gone \" ( well , almost nothing ) . it 'll be in the history logs - i looked and it ai n't there . : william buckley ( every one really likes that guy ) stated that it was proper on the fact that merkel made such bra od comment on it . further it has been up for going on five years and the fact that it has been has made it notable according to wikipedia rules . you do n't loose notability once had . i know such rules . i may not be best editor but i try . ok - if you have acceptable notable references for f - units then please tell use where to go and read them and we 'll finally be able to say something meaningful about them . personally , i 'm quite sure you do n't have such evidence . : i watched you get into debate with the collins on \" would be \" language you put in and consensus was reached on \" the patent claims \" as a com pro mi ze instead of \" device is \" that he liked . it stayed several months untouched after that after several editors posted their opinion in just debate then which included the language in there then of the other parts . please point us to where this debate happened . i do n't think it ever did . but again , that something stayed here for months ( or even years ) does n't mean we ca n't fix it later if it 's wrong . : in february during the final syn this is of the article there is no \" final \" in wikipedia . we improve the encyclopedia continuously . : collins asked if it would be ok to use his long name that he is known as because there are so many \" mike collins \" out there , and such including one of the three men who landed on the moon first . this was seen as reasonable and was left there many months in agreement which is consensus . that 's irrelevent . and i do n't think it ever happened . again - point to the history where it was discussed . wikipedia has guidelines for this kind of thing - and we do n't go around spelling out people 's middle names except in some very exceptional cases . even if it was \" agreed \" - it was agreed incorrectly and now we 're going to fix it . : you were not here but there has been times when collins and editors got al long nicely and i like such like that . why not now ? i no like this fighting . sorry - but the fact that previous editors did n't understand the rules - or chose to ignore them does n't set some kind of precedent . getting along nicely is secondary to making a decent encyclopedia . also , standards of consistency and verifiability have been improving steadily for several years now - articles that were once full - blown \" featured articles \" now come under scrutiny and are found lacking . so stop dwelling in the past - let 's make this article modern and up to current wikipedia standards . : i know technology . i know what i see there in his site would work if you place four electromagnetic coils on top of it which will animate it to put the tiles and it is made of the tiles so it will \" self - replicate \" . i 'm biting my tongue . it does n't matter whether you believe this or not - it does n't even matter if you built one and got it to work . what matters is whether we can read about it on a reliable source . if there were ( for example ) an article about f - units in \" scientific american \" or \" the new york times \" - then we 'd consider that to be reasonable evidence . but just because you ( or collins ) say it 's true is quite utterly irrelevant . : he has picture that looks good to me practiced in this sort of thing and i check file at patent office and a working one was definitely shown to the examiner and a photo is on file . no - he did n't have to show a working system to the examiner . we have n't had that requirement for years or more . the photo could be anything - it looks to me like some cut - out plastic bits . sure , it might be real - but unless we have some solid rd party documentation proving that this works - then it 's right up with an awful lot of crackpot stuff that 's out there . : maybe you call examiner ?

      "the outcomes of wars or major military operations are decided by strategy , how well the strategic goals are set and if they are accomplished . see below . : decisive means it had a direct impact on the fighting , which it did according to the sources above . - : possible success on strategic level does not diminish the failure on the operational level which is also highly relevant to the article as it concerns the operation , not the war . also which one of the sources states it was decisive ? - : see the quotes above . if it forced finland from the war , it can be said to be decisive . : for this strategic offensive , the operational failures were not important because the main goal was still accomplished without them . the strategic level concerns the operation also . the operational level is only a link between the tactical and strategic levels . : so what result do you want the infobox to have now ? \" soviet strategic victory ; operational failure \" ? again , failure is not accurate since many operational goals were accomplished . - : which of them explicitly states it would have been decisive ? if there are none then it is only deduction and not valid . again , we are discussing the whole of the offensive , not just some aspects of it . and neither are we discussing the war . so you can not ignore others aspects of the offensive because you do not like them . actually i 'm going to edit what i suggest in the result screen after reading rd opinions . - : editing it after third opinions were given does not seem right . just as i noted , you had no position and just wanted to deny what i was explaining . : if this was one battle or a limited offensive then you can argue that operational goals matter , but this was a large scale strategic offensive that was meant to achieve a strategic aim , which , as glantz writes , is above everything else . operational goals do n't matter unless they affect strategic ones . strategic goals do n't only apply to a war in general , but also to separate military operations . glantz mentions this below ( overall vs . particular strategic aims ) . : i told you why it can be said to be decisive . i could also ask you where does it explicitly say that it was not decisive , like was originally claimed . - : as for the result you want now , i guess it is one solution , but it has to be consistent then and apply for other articles for which such disputes arise , like battles of [ wiki link : battle of vy borg bay ( ) vy borg bay ] , [ wiki link : battle of vu o sal mi ] and [ wiki link : battle of tali - i han tala tali - i han tala ] . - : i never thought that single entry for the result would have been valid for it - like was obvious from the start of this discussion - and only provided one because of your insistence on the matter . after having been reminded that there were an option to leave it blank and discuss it in the article i found that it was a better solution . as has been said repeatedly , you can not ignore the operational aspect just because you dislike it . as we are discussing the operation not the war we can not afford it ignore operation goals . claim that it would have been decisive does need to actually come source ; also you are the one making the claim so burden of proof is yours , do not try to place it on any other . we are discussing the offensive in this article and in this discussion , not anything else . similar result may apply to other articles as well but whether it does or does not is not within the scope of this discussion . nor can it be used as a reasoning for setting results in other articles , they are separate matters and need to be handled separately . - : i was not the one who first mentioned decisive . i responded when it was claimed that the offensive was not decisive . however , again , if it knocked finland out of the war , it can be said to be so . : operational goals may be very important for a single battle , but this is a strategic offensive . : the articles are all related , so we can set a standard of how to deal with such disputes about the result . - : tactical goals are important for a single battles , operational goals are important for operations or off en sives . sure strategic goals are as well but you can not go ignoring operational goals just because you dislike them . relation is irrelevant , we are discussing this specific article , not anything else . you can not draw conclusions or make p rec ed ences that affect other articles from it . method for handling each of the other articles needs to be considered one at a time . - : if third options will be asked for the other articles , similar suggestions will be made or those who already commented here will point us to how this dispute was resolved . : you just can not or refuse to understand the types of goals and how they relate to each other . - : it may or it may not . i do not know that for certain for i 'm not pres cient . regardless those articles are each and every one separate cases and should be considered as such all the time . what it stated in this articles result has no relevance on the results of those articles since the topics of the articles are not the same . - : the topic is the same . the mentioned battles are all part of this offensive . if this whole offensive is not a soviet victory even though the main goal was accomplished , why are battles like tali - i han tala considered finnish victories ? : for wikipedia it is common to apply a decision made for an article to related articles or cases , instead of wasting time with each . so if you want that solution , it makes sense to apply it for all the related articles . - : no , the topics are clearly defined . those battles are separate articles handling the battles and this article concerns solely the offensive . straying further out of the topic is just waste of time - it has no relevance to this discussion . just like you can not extrapolate on what sources are saying neither can you extrapolate with this kind of matter . what might be done with those article must be discussed single article at a time . simply because a solution is made for the article discussing the offensive does not mean that articles referring to the battles in the offensive would need to be automatically handled in the same way . as said this discussion has no relevance to those articles . - : that is what you like to think . you do n't want the same logic to be applied to the related articles . - : so it should be a soviet victory ( at least strategic ) or a link to the aftermath section which will apply to all the other articles as well . - : but there you are wrong once again , same logic can applied to the other articles if there is actually reason for it . so far you have shown nothing of such , only your personal opinion of the matter . the same method used here can not apply the result of the campaign directly into the results of the battles . their actual results are not connected - there are several cases where battles within operations have different results than the overall operation ( or war ) . as to the regards to your edit to the initial result explanation , do you have any sources or proof that ' other articles related to this one ' would not be any less complex ? regardless the result of the offensive does not apply as the result of the battles unlike what you stated , they are separate articles and need to be considered separately . - : the main goal was achieved , but the result becomes too complex for the infobox because some secondary goals were not accomplished . why then should this principal not apply to related articles ? the finns could not hold the vy borg bay islands , retreated from tali , and gave up the beach head at vu o sal mi . they failed to accomplish many of their goals ; they lost important positions and did not win any new ones . so what makes the results in those articles less complex than this one ? - : that is only because you intentionally choose to ignore the operative goals and failures to accomplish them and instead solely concentrate on the claimed strategic goal . actual result is as per your statement above , too complex to state in the result entry . finnish goal in those engagements was to prevent soviets from breaching the finnish line , which was accomplished , line may have bent but it was not broken . soviet goals on the other hand was not accomplished in any of the engagements you listed . they are separate articles so they need to be considered separately . provide sources for the related articles in their respective talk pages . if there is a legitimate case for using the aftermath section then it can and should be used , however so far i have seen none of that apart from un - sourced claims . - : so you need sources about the finns losing the vy borg bay islands , tali , and the vu o sal mi beach head ? : many soviet goals were accomplished in those engagements . : the main finnish goal was to prevent a breakthrough , just like the main soviet goal of the offensive was to knock finland out of the war . : you can not just solely concentrate on the claimed operational goal of the battles and intentionally choose to ignore the finnish failure to accomplish tactical ones . : as you see the same arguments you are using can be used for the articles of the battles . : anyway , i see no reason that strategic victory should not be part of the result , as the sources directly support it . - : i have n't seen sources stating that soviet goals would have been fulfilled in the engagements . besides this discussion is already out of the scope of the article at hand , if you have specific claims to make , please make them at appropriate article talk page . sources which you prefer support it but those are not all the sources like you well know - cherry picking sources according to the preferred result should n't be done . - : sources can be given on the talk pages if you are denying that the soviets accomplished anything in those engagements . : cherry picking would be quoting someone like sol onin , not glantz or erick son . : so what sources dispute that it was a strategic victory ? one finnish source does not make it disputable . - : so give sources , so far you have given none . no , cherry picking would be for me to use the sources you stated and claim the result as full finnish victory . just because they oppose your statements does not make them ' cherry picked sources ' . point of the discussion was not that statement but actually the phrasing that ends up into the result entry since you , again , can not go ignoring other aspects of the operation just because you dislike them . - : i found sources that give an overall assessment of the offensive , while you found ones that only talk about a part of the offensive . my sources talk about the main strategic goals and their successful completion , while yours are about the failure to accomplish some secondary operational goals . this is not cherry picking ? the result should reflect the overall outcome of the fighting . : you may dispute that full \" soviet victory \" in the result is unfair , but \" soviet strategic victory \" is not disputable at this point and should be the result . - : those sources also discuss the result in overall terms , and you know this just as well . they are just not discussing it from the point of view you prefer . if you chose to ignore them when you are representing the sources then you were cherry picking - and it was what you did was it not ? it certainly was not npov . if the article was considering the offensive solely from strategic point of view you would be correct with your assessment . however it does not consider the offensive solely from the strategic point of view - instead it is about the offensive as a whole , including but not limited to strategic aspects - so expressing the result only according to the strategic view does not work in this case . also since it has been shown that expressing the result is near impossible within the limits of the results box it is advisable to use separate section in the article handle it . as per guidelines given for the infobox military conflict . - : so which of your sources \" discuss the result in overall terms \" ? : the strategic point of view is the overall view of the whole offensive , and the strategic result is the overall result : a strategic victory is a victory that brings long - term advantage to the victor and disturbs the enemy 's ability to wage a war . when a historian speaks of a victory in general , it is usually referring to a strategic victory . : your failure to understand fundamental aspects of war is disturbing . : like i said , \" soviet strategic victory \" is not disputable , and should be in the result . it shows the overall result , but does not discount that the finns had some success on the battlefield . - : article discusses the whole of the offensive , not just single aspect of it - hence you can not limit the result to such either . you can not go ignoring certain aspects just because you do not like about them . also even in the article you linked the given reference article avoids using solely the strategic result in the result box , instead it uses split result as was suggested initially , however since it appear that it is not possible to reach an agreement on what it should read it would be best to use - as suggested by infobox guidelines - to use separate article section to discuss the result . also once again , keep your perceptions and insinuations to yourself , they have no place in wiki . - : so i see that you have nothing else to say other than to repeat the same things . you are making it seem like it is impossible to find a result that fits . sources say that it was a strategic victory and it does not matter that you do n't like it . - : some source say so while others say that it did failed to achieve its objectives . hence the problem in forming the result . and that is why the aftermath section is the preferred route , at least it is for every one else involved in the original discussion with the exception of you . - : others said that soviet victory is also fine . : what sources say that it failed to achieve its strategic objectives ? once again , one finnish source does not make a strategic soviet victory debatable . - : as stated before the strategic level in not what editors should be solely concerned about . you can not ignore other aspects of the offensive just because you dislike them . that is not npov . - : stated where ? the source below suggests otherwise . : do you at least admit that it was a strategic victory ? - : i said that in the initial postings . my position towards the ' strategic ' level result is not reason enough ( at any level ) to ignore the other aspects of the offensive . and that is why the suggested method of using separate section in the text to discuss the more complex results is preferred , and not just by me . - : you did not answer the question . do you admit that it was a soviet strategic victory or not ? - : i did answer it , feel free to re - read the discussion . it is there . - : so i take it that you do n't want to answer the question ? : from the discussion , i see that you more or less agree that it was a strategic victory , but you just wo n't accept that this means that it was a victory generally . - : i answered to it several times actually , i fail to see the point to copy - paste my responses here . almost , but not quite . i do not think that strategic level is the sole measurement that should be used in such an occasion , which is shown also generally accepted view judging from other articles from wiki . hence the need for more complex result and since it has not been something that has been agreed upon , a need for a separate aftermath section for discussing the result in detail . as instructed in the guidelines for the infobox military history . - : you are once again avoiding answering the question and just repeating the same thing . : if you think that you have answered it before , what prevents you from giving a straight answer now ? - : because the answer was - and still is - conditional as described above . - : what ? i asked if you admit that it was a strategic victory for the soviets ? yes or no ? - : and i gave you an answer already . you are not in position to make ul ti mat ums . - the strategic aim ( strate gi ches kai a t sel ' ) of any conflict dictates the nature , scope and form of military operations . established by the political leadership of a nation , strategic aims represent the desired end of strategic - scale military actions . achievement of strategic aims generally leads to significant , and sometimes fundamental , changes in military - political and strategic conditions , which , in turn , can contribute to the victorious conclusion of a war . the soviets subdivided strategic aims into overall ( ob sh chie ) strategic aims which represent the \" fundamental results of the war \" and particular ( cha st nye ) strategic aims , which result from successful campaigns or strategic operations . the strategic war aims determine the size and nature of strategic groupings of forces within a theater of military operations or on a strategic direction and determine the form of military actions undertaken . these aims transcend all other considerations .

[ wiki link : wikipedia : esperanza xd ] - [ wiki link : wikipedia : semi - protection policy did you read this ? ] ) i just edited the current info to say ' anticipated southward movement . ' there was no significant southward mov ment to the track for some hours after the am ( as of around noon cst z dec th ) , so the southward movement did n't start until then . to note : there were at least four track forecasts before the movement to the track was adjusted to the ese , where epsilon went to the south of the forecast points , sometimes not even making the first forecast point ( fairly unusual ) . but , as soon as they adjusted to the expected southward movement and turn to the sw , epsilon started moving pretty much due east , and the last two track forecasts have missed the other direction , as epsilon has moved to the north of the track points . this all points to the dependency on recon and drop son de information for accurate track forecasts . i bet what is really making everyone crazy at nhc t pc right now is the inability to send out even one recon , not just for the normal reasons , but for a chance to get some data to understand what is making epsilon go . is it still some kind of hybrid ? is there some kind of bar oc lin ic process going on , that can only occur in the colder environment ? is wind shear not affecting it mainly because convection is shallow , or is the outflow strong enough to deflect the wind shear ? why are the eye and eye wall so well - defined for such a weak tropical storm ? at least we know the wind estimates are not so far off because of the occasional qui k scat . : epsilon is definitely weakening now . on the satellite loop , you can see the southeastern portion of the eye breaking apart . epsilon looks like it 's ' going south ' rapidly . starting to tilt vertically and de couple from the wind shear , and the convection ero ded to the se again . i 'm convinced , now , in retrospect that it was still a hybrid system and receiving a shot of bar oc lin ic energy from the front that moved to the north , in some fashion , after re playing the nw atl loop from today and then looking at the flo ater . that would explain the intensity over the last three days . also . the slow down weakened it because of the cooler water . i was thinking previously that it was a shallow storm and that was why the shear was not affecting it ; now i think there is a possibility that it was not so shallow , and the outflow was fairly strong , enough to hold off the shear . also another possible explanation . epsilon is moving into an area with stronger winds at - mb level , rather than - mb , and if it was shallow , these strong winds at the lower level are now able to do what the higher shear could not . would appreciate any feedback on which might be more plausible . on the other hand it almost looks as if it is starting to rebuild that portion of the eye , there is now a large band of weak convection in the se portion of they eye , and that large band is starting to fire up a bit as of the latest image . who knows with epsilon , it might not be done yet after all . : , december ( utc ) i do n't have a clue now . it still looks de coupled a bit , but the convection did wrap back around and the outflow is back . it 's even looking less elongated . almost like one of those cartoon characters that takes a corner too sharply and the head keeps going the original direction , then rubber - bands back to the body . it turned the corner and the upper level circ almost did n't come along . the main convection does seem oddly cut off from the center now , though . well now it is more elongated but it does appear that the convection on the west might break away leaving a very small epsilon . it is really starting to struggle now . now the northern eye is starting to fade away . i was predicting it at tropical storm strength at this advisory , but now i think it might hold together until tomorrow yet . aww . poor ic kle epsilon . wait . it looks like it 's starting to recover that northern eye . the se p pr tion is almost normal , and his eye looks really o val ish . i would n't be suprised if he st reg th ened . we all know he 's tour ture . if we have another t . s , zeta , expect it to go through at the end of dec . and into jan . -

kt hurricane . knabb this time . maybe avila finally took a nap . i say forget \" poor ic kle epsilon \" and concentrate on poor ic kle li x ion avila , who seriously needs a hug and some hot cocoa . it seems like they may have traded times . knabb did the first overnight ( pm ) , avila covered the last overnight that knabb would normally have covered ( am ) , and then knabb came back for the am , which has been avila 's the last couple of days . i do n't know what the shift rotation is there . the \" small epsilon \" i wrote about last night did form , and is having a rough time today . dry air and shear is helping to break down the convection every time it re builds . the eye and central organization looked weak this morning but no on time the structure appears to have fir med up again , even with continued dry air en train ment breaking down the ring of convection around the eye . this is the first time however we have seen shear ripping the tops of convection off the center ring , in spite of the c im ss wind shear product reducing the shear the first time in days to below kts ( do n't trust that so much . always go by what you can see on sat images and use it in conjunction with that ) . still improving and i think they 'll leave it a hurricane at the pm . what is left of ep si lon is now forecast by nearly all the models to become involved in some way with a frontal zone in about three days . and the new official forecast follows suit . the front would be associated with an extratropical low pressure system forecast by all of the models to develop north of epsilon in about hours . i hesitate to mention that most of the models forecast this extratropical system . after absorbing epsilon . to sag back to the south of n on day to the west of the canary islands . i do n't know whether to laugh or cry . i imagine knabb and avila just holding each other while the world ends . the end is in sight . it really is . but in the meantime . epsilon continues to maintain hurricane status . i 'm laughing so hard , but feeling bad for doing it . poor fo rec asters . and this is franklin , not knabb or avila . : are they really sure about that ? he 's defying everything ! this is like a broken record . funny part of all this is that every nhc forecast has had demise of epsilon after hours for , oh , days straight , and it is still \" hours away \" . that said , i truly believe this time it is for real , it is going down , honest . i think that in a paradoxical way , entering warmer conditions may actually weaken the storm , because then it becomes more tropical and thus , more vulnerable to hostile conditions and it no longer has the extratropical processes which apparently kept it going against all odds . : when he said ' the end is in sight ' , he meant that epsilon 's dis sip ation is in sight , not the end of the world . - ' : dr . avila comes back from his nice rest only to see his colleague 's comment about the end , and then this : the end is in sight . yes . but not quite yet . i thought i was going to find a weakening system and instead i found that epsilon is still a hurricane . as it has done every morning . the con vec tion has re developed around the large and distinct eye . kicking the dv orak t - numbers back up again . all agencies support hur ri can e intensity . : poor dr . avila , he should permanently hand this storm to knabb or franklin . also , note this : i have no option but to forecast weakening at a fast pace . never there less . there is very little confidence in the in ten si ty forecast . : the nhc seem to think epsilon could out smart them again . ( [ wiki link : wp : cvu cvu ] ) okay . now i can say poor ic kle knabb and avila , as well as franklin . it seems to me that epsilon is holding a whip and whipping nhc . good news though , i looked at the sat te lite of epsilon , and the eye looks poorly defined . really bad oval look to it . i think it may finally be downgraded soon . : here i have to go against the nhc on this one . i actually think strengthening is in order . this time tomorrow , i think it will still be a hurricane , and a stronger one than it is now . in fact , i would n't be surprised if epsilon has not reached peak intensity yet . : aww . it looks like its falling apart . yeah the east part of the hurricane is falling apart , its being attacked by strong wind shear , as of rig th now . i say it 's still a hurricane as it still has an eye , but i only give it a couple more hours before the shear completely makes they eye collapse , and then rapid we aking will ( hopefully ) occur . it appears that the advisories and discussions are now being issued by the hydro meteorological prediction center . i 'm not sure what the significance of that is ; i thought the h pc usually reports on extratropical and non - tropical low pressure systems in the atlantic . is this because epsilon 's fate is really sealed this time ? was the nhc ep sil - u tely fed up with this system ? is this something that should be reflected in the article ? : it 's likely only a temporary change for this advisory . occasionally , the h pc has had to release advisories for the nhc before , perhaps due to e qu p im ent problems or scheduled service or upgrades that kept the nhc from issuing the advisory themselves . when i worked at the nws in detroit this summer , occasionally our office would issue things for grand rapids , and vice versa , if was necessary to do so for the reasons listed above . epsilon looks very rag ged at the moment , if it is n't a tropical storm by the pm est advisory , i will probably go insane . epsilon is going down - and fast . pressure has risen mb , winds down to mph . avila and the gang are probably having a party at the moment . turns out i do n't have to go insane after all . who ot ! pop the champ ai gne ! ( how do you spell it ? ) mph , and i thi k : p . m . is the last advisory for ze torture man ! he looks like gamma as a tropical depression ! skinned to where only the circulation is showing ! good ' ol wind shear ! : finally , his luck ran out . now is the season over ? or do we still have a surprise left ? o . o i looked at w under blog 's blog about epsilon 's death , and they said the remnant circulation has a small chance of becoming zeta . in about . oh . four days . please let it not be like epsilon . though if she wo n't , she would obviously not form anyway . everyone is sick of it . edit : oh crap ! i spelled my name wrong because of that ! : , december ( utc ) : the season finally ends ! epsilon sur renders at last . epsilon reminded me much of the season ; it just would n't quit . it 's over , it 's finally over ! now the nhc guys get a much needed break . - ' . epsilon weakening rapidly . this is the last advisory . it is about time . we love you , mr . avila , just so you know ) : pst ! it 's dr . avila . but we do love him . : whoever keeps changing the nice epsilon photo back to that ugly one with the orange lines , please stop\n",

      "so you 've been to northern kosovo and spoken to kla people ? yet you 've never seen a kla agent with a beard even though some of their top s po kes men were saudi or afghani during the sky news broadcasts , in uniform , direct from the albania kosovo border , \" as we are going in to take those serbian positions \" . well if you know the kla , then you 'll know a saying \" blood calls for blood , you start a war \" . and this is what you do . let 's talk fact , you 're not interested in kosovo are you ? you 're either an albanian posing as an investigator or a sadly misinformed outsider . only you know which of the two you are . you see , the fact is , the masses from britain and america do n't know k lec ka , many have heard of rac ak but how many have heard of k lec ka ? if your sources and their authors were so confident that this was all a fabrication , why is never any mention of it anywhere ? you know as well as i do that in , too much focus on the activities of the kla would have upset the balance ; people like you ( assuming you 're the westerner ) like to have their ear tic kled by fairy tale stories of ag gre sive mi li taries harming innocent people , but if and when it is known that those individuals are not so innocent in intent , that they too have caused ag gri vation ; it starts to look more like indonesia where the government was never internationally condemned over the years of bloodshed in ace h , because at various stages of the conflicts , all angles were covered . you said to pax that the kla are not terrorists but more like the original ira . you can fool an ignorant american with nonsensical statistics , but every tooth less simple ton in africa , asia , south america , eastern europe and the pacific knows that one man 's freedom fighter is another man 's terrorist ; one man 's op re ssor is another man 's liber ator ; one man 's war hero is another man 's war criminal ; one man 's ally is another man 's enemy ; one man 's peace keeper is another man 's invader , and so forth , the list grows . when a non - governmental body takes up arms , you can call them whatever you like , but do n't look for words like \" compassionate \" or \" righteous \" . \" it does n't matter if you 're left or to your right , do n't try to hide behind the cause , for which you fight ! \" - sound familiar ? as for your sources not being equal , that is absolutely true when one does n't like what he is reading from another source . you have decided that you do n't like the sound of pro - serb anti - albanian sentiment , which is odd , as even a number of once avid us uk peace keepers were accidently \" exposed \" to information which their governments never wanted them to see , finally saw that there was more to the kosovo crisis than met the eye . nobody withdrew their condemnation for the yugoslav activities , but they did see them in more light and start to realise why they did some of the things which they did , whilst acknowledging that the al anians too cause and did cause horrific acts . if every incident and dare i say , allegation , was reported piece by piece from the beginning , the public would have had a different perception . your pro - albanian stories regarding kosovo ( having looked at what you call sources ) all come from albanian accounts or reports declarations made by journalists officials who are close to their re sep ctive governments and these in turn are those of the nato countries who attacked yugoslavia or close friends of theirs us puppet states . do n't lie to yourself that free media means that everything they say is true . if they are so free , then what is stopping them telling lies ? do n't give me \" oh but they do n't need to \" co blers , because they decided to get involved in the first place , which means that they knew what they were interested in . nick haw ton makes so many factual errors that even a beginner can not trust him , yet he to this day comments on serb aggression and albanian pre - innocence . equally , just because a media may be state - controlled , does that au tom a ticly suggest that they are lying ? just supposing , an event which took place worked in favour of the state ? do these things never happen ? the milosevic news networks reported over missing serbs from kosovo all kidnapped since the k for takeover . i suppose that is all fabricated . only one way to tell : milosevic is ou sted , within six months , the new \" free serbian media \" publish reports that this figure is now , as for ? it has risen even higher . i suppose that the serbian media is still sps controlled ? would n't you say ? , eh ? what are these compassionate drug - dealers with false beards doing with them mr . d av u ? teaching them history of art ? come on , wake up and smell the roses . i do n't deny serbian atrocity in kosovo , but i know a lot of things that you do n't : you hav n't heard the beginning from me yet . at the end of our dispute , it will be check mate because only i know the argument which awaits you , the one which you would never say these things about if you really knew\n",

      "the outcomes of wars or major military operations are decided by strategy , how well the strategic goals are set and if they are accomplished . see below . : decisive means it had a direct impact on the fighting , which it did according to the sources above . - : possible success on strategic level does not diminish the failure on the operational level which is also highly relevant to the article as it concerns the operation , not the war . also which one of the sources states it was decisive ? - : see the quotes above . if it forced finland from the war , it can be said to be decisive . : for this strategic offensive , the operational failures were not important because the main goal was still accomplished without them . the strategic level concerns the operation also . the operational level is only a link between the tactical and strategic levels . : so what result do you want the infobox to have now ? \" soviet strategic victory ; operational failure \" ? again , failure is not accurate since many operational goals were accomplished . - : which of them explicitly states it would have been decisive ? if there are none then it is only deduction and not valid . again , we are discussing the whole of the offensive , not just some aspects of it . and neither are we discussing the war . so you can not ignore others aspects of the offensive because you do not like them . actually i 'm going to edit what i suggest in the result screen after reading rd opinions . - : editing it after third opinions were given does not seem right . just as i noted , you had no position and just wanted to deny what i was explaining . : if this was one battle or a limited offensive then you can argue that operational goals matter , but this was a large scale strategic offensive that was meant to achieve a strategic aim , which , as glantz writes , is above everything else . operational goals do n't matter unless they affect strategic ones . strategic goals do n't only apply to a war in general , but also to separate military operations . glantz mentions this below ( overall vs . particular strategic aims ) . : i told you why it can be said to be decisive . i could also ask you where does it explicitly say that it was not decisive , like was originally claimed . - : as for the result you want now , i guess it is one solution , but it has to be consistent then and apply for other articles for which such disputes arise , like battles of [ wiki link : battle of vy borg bay ( ) vy borg bay ] , [ wiki link : battle of vu o sal mi ] and [ wiki link : battle of tali - i han tala tali - i han tala ] . - : i never thought that single entry for the result would have been valid for it - like was obvious from the start of this discussion - and only provided one because of your insistence on the matter . after having been reminded that there were an option to leave it blank and discuss it in the article i found that it was a better solution . as has been said repeatedly , you can not ignore the operational aspect just because you dislike it . as we are discussing the operation not the war we can not afford it ignore operation goals . claim that it would have been decisive does need to actually come source ; also you are the one making the claim so burden of proof is yours , do not try to place it on any other . we are discussing the offensive in this article and in this discussion , not anything else . similar result may apply to other articles as well but whether it does or does not is not within the scope of this discussion . nor can it be used as a reasoning for setting results in other articles , they are separate matters and need to be handled separately . - : i was not the one who first mentioned decisive . i responded when it was claimed that the offensive was not decisive . however , again , if it knocked finland out of the war , it can be said to be so . : operational goals may be very important for a single battle , but this is a strategic offensive . : the articles are all related , so we can set a standard of how to deal with such disputes about the result . - : tactical goals are important for a single battles , operational goals are important for operations or off en sives . sure strategic goals are as well but you can not go ignoring operational goals just because you dislike them . relation is irrelevant , we are discussing this specific article , not anything else . you can not draw conclusions or make p rec ed ences that affect other articles from it . method for handling each of the other articles needs to be considered one at a time . - : if third options will be asked for the other articles , similar suggestions will be made or those who already commented here will point us to how this dispute was resolved . : you just can not or refuse to understand the types of goals and how they relate to each other . - : it may or it may not . i do not know that for certain for i 'm not pres cient . regardless those articles are each and every one separate cases and should be considered as such all the time . what it stated in this articles result has no relevance on the results of those articles since the topics of the articles are not the same . - : the topic is the same . the mentioned battles are all part of this offensive . if this whole offensive is not a soviet victory even though the main goal was accomplished , why are battles like tali - i han tala considered finnish victories ? : for wikipedia it is common to apply a decision made for an article to related articles or cases , instead of wasting time with each . so if you want that solution , it makes sense to apply it for all the related articles . - : no , the topics are clearly defined . those battles are separate articles handling the battles and this article concerns solely the offensive . straying further out of the topic is just waste of time - it has no relevance to this discussion . just like you can not extrapolate on what sources are saying neither can you extrapolate with this kind of matter . what might be done with those article must be discussed single article at a time . simply because a solution is made for the article discussing the offensive does not mean that articles referring to the battles in the offensive would need to be automatically handled in the same way . as said this discussion has no relevance to those articles . - : that is what you like to think . you do n't want the same logic to be applied to the related articles . - : so it should be a soviet victory ( at least strategic ) or a link to the aftermath section which will apply to all the other articles as well . - : but there you are wrong once again , same logic can applied to the other articles if there is actually reason for it . so far you have shown nothing of such , only your personal opinion of the matter . the same method used here can not apply the result of the campaign directly into the results of the battles . their actual results are not connected - there are several cases where battles within operations have different results than the overall operation ( or war ) . as to the regards to your edit to the initial result explanation , do you have any sources or proof that ' other articles related to this one ' would not be any less complex ? regardless the result of the offensive does not apply as the result of the battles unlike what you stated , they are separate articles and need to be considered separately . - : the main goal was achieved , but the result becomes too complex for the infobox because some secondary goals were not accomplished . why then should this principal not apply to related articles ? the finns could not hold the vy borg bay islands , retreated from tali , and gave up the beach head at vu o sal mi . they failed to accomplish many of their goals ; they lost important positions and did not win any new ones . so what makes the results in those articles less complex than this one ? - : that is only because you intentionally choose to ignore the operative goals and failures to accomplish them and instead solely concentrate on the claimed strategic goal . actual result is as per your statement above , too complex to state in the result entry . finnish goal in those engagements was to prevent soviets from breaching the finnish line , which was accomplished , line may have bent but it was not broken . soviet goals on the other hand was not accomplished in any of the engagements you listed . they are separate articles so they need to be considered separately . provide sources for the related articles in their respective talk pages . if there is a legitimate case for using the aftermath section then it can and should be used , however so far i have seen none of that apart from un - sourced claims . - : so you need sources about the finns losing the vy borg bay islands , tali , and the vu o sal mi beach head ? : many soviet goals were accomplished in those engagements . : the main finnish goal was to prevent a breakthrough , just like the main soviet goal of the offensive was to knock finland out of the war . : you can not just solely concentrate on the claimed operational goal of the battles and intentionally choose to ignore the finnish failure to accomplish tactical ones . : as you see the same arguments you are using can be used for the articles of the battles . : anyway , i see no reason that strategic victory should not be part of the result , as the sources directly support it . - : i have n't seen sources stating that soviet goals would have been fulfilled in the engagements . besides this discussion is already out of the scope of the article at hand , if you have specific claims to make , please make them at appropriate article talk page . sources which you prefer support it but those are not all the sources like you well know - cherry picking sources according to the preferred result should n't be done . - : sources can be given on the talk pages if you are denying that the soviets accomplished anything in those engagements . : cherry picking would be quoting someone like sol onin , not glantz or erick son . : so what sources dispute that it was a strategic victory ? one finnish source does not make it disputable . - : so give sources , so far you have given none . no , cherry picking would be for me to use the sources you stated and claim the result as full finnish victory . just because they oppose your statements does not make them ' cherry picked sources ' . point of the discussion was not that statement but actually the phrasing that ends up into the result entry since you , again , can not go ignoring other aspects of the operation just because you dislike them . - : i found sources that give an overall assessment of the offensive , while you found ones that only talk about a part of the offensive . my sources talk about the main strategic goals and their successful completion , while yours are about the failure to accomplish some secondary operational goals . this is not cherry picking ? the result should reflect the overall outcome of the fighting . : you may dispute that full \" soviet victory \" in the result is unfair , but \" soviet strategic victory \" is not disputable at this point and should be the result . - : those sources also discuss the result in overall terms , and you know this just as well . they are just not discussing it from the point of view you prefer . if you chose to ignore them when you are representing the sources then you were cherry picking - and it was what you did was it not ? it certainly was not npov . if the article was considering the offensive solely from strategic point of view you would be correct with your assessment . however it does not consider the offensive solely from the strategic point of view - instead it is about the offensive as a whole , including but not limited to strategic aspects - so expressing the result only according to the strategic view does not work in this case . also since it has been shown that expressing the result is near impossible within the limits of the results box it is advisable to use separate section in the article handle it . as per guidelines given for the infobox military conflict . - : so which of your sources \" discuss the result in overall terms \" ? : the strategic point of view is the overall view of the whole offensive , and the strategic result is the overall result : a strategic victory is a victory that brings long - term advantage to the victor and disturbs the enemy 's ability to wage a war . when a historian speaks of a victory in general , it is usually referring to a strategic victory . : your failure to understand fundamental aspects of war is disturbing . : like i said , \" soviet strategic victory \" is not disputable , and should be in the result . it shows the overall result , but does not discount that the finns had some success on the battlefield . - : article discusses the whole of the offensive , not just single aspect of it - hence you can not limit the result to such either . you can not go ignoring certain aspects just because you do not like about them . also even in the article you linked the given reference article avoids using solely the strategic result in the result box , instead it uses split result as was suggested initially , however since it appear that it is not possible to reach an agreement on what it should read it would be best to use - as suggested by infobox guidelines - to use separate article section to discuss the result . also once again , keep your perceptions and insinuations to yourself , they have no place in wiki . - : so i see that you have nothing else to say other than to repeat the same things . you are making it seem like it is impossible to find a result that fits . sources say that it was a strategic victory and it does not matter that you do n't like it . - : some source say so while others say that it did failed to achieve its objectives . hence the problem in forming the result . and that is why the aftermath section is the preferred route , at least it is for every one else involved in the original discussion with the exception of you . - : others said that soviet victory is also fine . : what sources say that it failed to achieve its strategic objectives ? once again , one finnish source does not make a strategic soviet victory debatable . - : as stated before the strategic level in not what editors should be solely concerned about . you can not ignore other aspects of the offensive just because you dislike them . that is not npov . - : stated where ? the source below suggests otherwise . : do you at least admit that it was a strategic victory ? - : i said that in the initial postings . my position towards the ' strategic ' level result is not reason enough ( at any level ) to ignore the other aspects of the offensive . and that is why the suggested method of using separate section in the text to discuss the more complex results is preferred , and not just by me . - : you did not answer the question . do you admit that it was a soviet strategic victory or not ? - : i did answer it , feel free to re - read the discussion . it is there . - : so i take it that you do n't want to answer the question ? : from the discussion , i see that you more or less agree that it was a strategic victory , but you just wo n't accept that this means that it was a victory generally . - : i answered to it several times actually , i fail to see the point to copy - paste my responses here . almost , but not quite . i do not think that strategic level is the sole measurement that should be used in such an occasion , which is shown also generally accepted view judging from other articles from wiki . hence the need for more complex result and since it has not been something that has been agreed upon , a need for a separate aftermath section for discussing the result in detail . as instructed in the guidelines for the infobox military history . - : you are once again avoiding answering the question and just repeating the same thing . : if you think that you have answered it before , what prevents you from giving a straight answer now ? - : because the answer was - and still is - conditional as described above . - : what ? i asked if you admit that it was a strategic victory for the soviets ? yes or no ? - : and i gave you an answer already . you are not in position to make ul ti mat ums . - : it is not an ultimatum ; you are just avoiding answering the question . you have done nothing but reverts here lately . i ask you to restore the sourced result . - : to a biased question ? i already said that i had provide conditional answer to it previously which i had done . feel free to look it up , it is in this discussion . just because you were the last in the discussion does not make your stance in any way better than the opposing view . it is not the same as reaching consensus . - : if you refuse to answer , that is ending the discussion . : you still did not answer the question . - : even if the discussion would be over leaving your question unanswered ( or rather having provided answer previously ) does not prove you right . as has been seen other editors prefer to have no result entry at all . - : if its answer you want here goes . as the article does not consider the offensive just from the strategic point of view neither can the result do so either . your sources with regards to the soviet strategic victory are well and fine ( and undisputed actually ) , however they do not represent the whole of the offensive and therefore are not valid due npov reasons into the results entry . hence the need for a separate aftermath sections ( possibly even separate from the current aftermath section ) . i also previously encouraged you to write there of the soviet strategic victory but so far you have refused to take constructively part into improving that section of the article . - : there were no objections to strategic victory . you did not dispute it , so why should not it have gone into the article ? : as for what you are saying now , the aftermath section already states about the strategic goal . yes it can be improved . if strategic victory can go into there , why ca n't it go into the result ? : your claim that a strategic offensive can not be represented by the strategic result requires sources . if strategic victory is supported by the majority of sources , it should go into the result . if you find sources that talk about the overall result ( not partial ) on the other levels ( operational and tactical ) , you can bring them up . - : because it does not cover the subject that the articles handles . it only covers portion of it . hence it is not valid as a overall statement for the result . it would be valid to be a partial statement of the result so that the other levels where the offensive is handled could be properly represented as well . it should not go to the results box because this article does not handle the operation just from the strategic point of view . note that it is considered a soviet strategic victory is valuable to the article however it is not the sole statement how the offensive turned out nor is it representative of the offensive at all levels . as for the rest , we have been through that before . - : so again find sources for the overall results at the other levels just like i did for strategic . just because you do n't have those sources , does not mean that you can keep the strategic result out . as explained before , the strategic level is most important , especially for a strategic offensive . - : those sources were provided already earlier and you know this since you demanded them . strategic level is just one single aspect of the offensive , it can not be used to represent the whole of it . as was discussed previously . - : this is your opinion . read again what it says below . : the sources you found can not be used to get an overall operational or tactical result for the offensive , since they only talk about a part of it . - : they discuss the other aspects of the offensive and clearly note it as having been soviet failure when considered from the operational level . strategic level is not the sole matter of consideration since the article is not only about that . - : well again find sources for the other levels . failure to achieve some tactical or operational goals does not make the whole offensive a failure on those levels . that is why stalemate is more accurate , but it has to be sourced . - the strategic aim ( strate gi ches kai a t sel ' ) of any conflict dictates the nature , scope and form of military operations . established by the political leadership of a nation , strategic aims represent the desired end of strategic - scale military actions . achievement of strategic aims generally leads to significant , and sometimes fundamental , changes in military - political and strategic conditions , which , in turn , can contribute to the victorious conclusion of a war . the soviets subdivided strategic aims into overall ( ob sh chie ) strategic aims which represent the \" fundamental results of the war \" and particular ( cha st nye ) strategic aims , which result from successful campaigns or strategic operations . the strategic war aims determine the size and nature of strategic groupings of forces within a theater of military operations or on a strategic direction and determine the form of military actions undertaken . these aims transcend all other considerations .

      "well , that is a bit ex ag erated , but still , now i have you attention . i have question problem . i have been working the last couple of days on . this morning ed asked me to add more images to that template . easy . done . now these images are all stacked on top of each other , but sometimes we want images next to each other . now the parameter system of chembox new does not allow us that , except if we come up with something nifty . i was thinking about having just image file , and image file as the standard settings , but in the template , i could just enable two extra lines with image file l & and image fil er & , which give two rows having two images on each row , next to each other . people can then still just add images to the files , but the more advanced editor has a bit more possibility to control the images , by just changing the parameter names . any ideas ? : that sounds like an ideal solution ! there are ( rarely ) situations in which it is desirable to have three images side - by - side , for example in [ wiki link : hydra zine ] . we could just ignore this issue , or add image file l , and image file l etc . i would be happy with either . : cheers : i 'm already trying . have some trouble but i will manage , i hope . do we have a page that has two side - by - side images that is easy to give a to ? : three might not even be too difficult , though . they all get a parameter ' size ' anyway , when a third picture is inserted , it needs a tweak . thanks . : how about [ wiki link : fur fur al ] ? is there anything i can do to help ? : fur fur al seems nice , i 'll transform that one . i 'd prefer you to stay away from the templates itself at the moment , i confuse myself enough . what you can do , could you read through the text on , and maybe give some hints ( is that explanation good , would that give most chemicals a good chembox possibility ? ) . i dropped the idea of pictures side - by - side , wim van dor st would now say ' combined pictures are a good thing ( tm ) ' . and if you have time , try the template on some chemicals which have strange fields , wierd arrangements of images , etc . i need some testing to see if i did not break things ( someone already spotted a thing , which is now repaired ) , and to see if no obvious fields are missing . that would be very helpful . thanks ! : fur fur al goes ok , image size is now px as standard , it was px in the original chembox . what would be a good standard there ? ? oh , by the way , if pages look nice after adding chembox new , just press save - ) fur fur al looks good . excellent work , mr chembox ! i disagree with wim that combined images are good . one problem is svg is best for skeletal formulae but png is best for d models . a combined image would be a compromise in that respect . i had an idea : how about creating some new image fields ( [ wiki link : skeletal formula ] , [ wiki link : structural formula ] , [ wiki link : space - filling model ] and [ wiki link : ball - and - stick model ] ) . with labels like that , having images one on top of the other would be fine . what do you think ? i 'll do some testing of chembox new for you , dirk . watch this space . cheers : i guess we will just have to live with images per row , should not be too difficult , we can accomodate ( ! ) images in the chembox if needed . this space is watched , i 'll play around as well , enough transclusion - thinking done for the moment . : i have built some au tom agic into the picture - system of ( see [ wiki link : nic ot in ami de ] , explanation in the template ) , but what are the most common pictures available on wikipedia ( not in commons . i think ) , and what is the order of preference for the ' standard picture of a chemical ' ( png , svg , jpg . ) ? thanks . excellent au tom agic ! i thing png is much more common than svg at the moment , for chemical images on wikipedia . but i think we should encourage svg use by having pri or ty in the order svg > png > gif > jpg for d images and png > jpg for d images or photos . some contributors have made sv gs for d images of molecules ( e . g . [ wiki link : ch lor o form ] ) but in most cases it is too complicated to make these , and only basic lighting effects can be easily used . thus i propose we modify our image drawing guidelines to say svg is preferred for d and png is preferred for d . how does that sound ? : for now i am concerned only with the au tom agic images , i have to test for image - existence , and take the first i find . imho , that should concern mainly d images ( i think a normal , d structure should have the name of the article , the more exotic representations should then become pagename - ball - and - stick . png and pagename - space fill . png . so the order for the au tom agic is going to be svg > png > gif > jpg , and otherwise they have to be overridden on the page by supplying the correct names in one of the available image fields . thanks ! the preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : sign your posts on talk pages unsigned ] comment was added by\n",

) , and many of them do not even advertise a top speed because it is irrelevant to the people who they sell them to , since it is unlikely in the extreme that they will ever be able to achieve that speed , since they do not have access to required very long track , real - world track performance is much more important ( acceleration , handling , breaking , etc . ) rather than raw speed , what this means is that this car is only the fastest that has been tested , not that it is really the fastest . it 's official ! ssc aero is the fastest ! it is oct . , and guinness has made it official . it is the fastest . in regards to that , i think the article needs a bit of cleaning , especially in the ' speed attempt ' section . so much for my bugatti fanboy ism ) for the sake of fairness , keep in mind that veyron does go as fast as . k mph , not k mph as stated in the article . i have just witnessed this with my eyes . also , how reliable are data produced by the car manufacturer ?

the bugatti veyron will do this speed and has been shown to repeat ably ( top gear showed this on camera ) on available fuel ( not specialist - oc tane fuel used in the ssc ) and they have already made . also is it really \" road legal \" a large chunk of the weight of the veyron and the ko en ig se g g ccr are engine ( obviously ) , and safety systems to make it road legal and dri vable . ?

if everyone is so sure that th ge car is that fast , what is keeping you ? face it . until it gets done , more and more people will question the claimed top speed . as far as i 'm concerned , a guinness world records certificate is n't a credible evidence . you can buy everything these days with the right amount of cash . doubts let 's think about it , shall we ? after we saw the vw guys , cracking their heads over and over again with the veyron , for years going back to square one , how can a car like the ssc ultimate aero , with a 's design , with almost bh p on two wheels alone , on a road instead of a race track , could achieve such a speed ? i mean , look at the mclaren f . when the guy reached k ph , the car almost seemed to de sin te grate ! the driver thought that he should stop the car . the mclaren f does n't even have bh p ! and the ccr ? it 's scary when your reach the k ph ! either the volkswagen guys in germany did n't find the best engineers ( because they were working in the usa ! ) , or all this about the ssc ultimate aero is just a publicity stunt for a small car manufacturer . which is it ? still waiting for the answer , because there 's something about this that does n't seem right . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by simple . americans engineers are smarter than the german ones . not anymore , apparently . criticism skepticism , top speed claim this section does n't contain any sources and is n't npov in the least . here a few examples . \" . that according to some do not seem credible or even feasible . \" no source \" jeremy clarkson said that the test driver was \" a year old man \" , and that he does not believe that the car really is better than the bugatti veyron . \" no source , irrelevent \" some critics do admit the possibility that the car does indeed live up to the guinness world of records certificate . \" who ? \" . but that does not in any way mean the car is better than the veyron . \" irrelevent , not npov , out right opinionated . etc . , etc . further more , the last claim . \" in spite of all doubts and criticisms and the way these are qualified , it is true however that the ssc ultimate aero has never been shown on camera and under credible circumstances ( such as having its speed measured by a gps t ach ometer ) reaching the claimed speed . \" . is not true . a video of the run , as well as the tele metry of the run , can be found [ external link : here ] . the tele metry was gathered by a de we tron gps data aqui sition system , as confirmed [ external link : here ] . also , this is the same gps data aqui sition system used by top gear during james may 's bugatti veyron top speed run , as confirmed [ external link : here ] . this proof pretty much dismisses this section entirely , and i do n't think that it would be a stretch to say that there are some fanboys here that are a little disappointed about the veyron being beat by this ' lo we ly ' small time american manufacturer or something . btw , i 'm not exactly a wiki - expert here , so my ap po logies if i did n't do everything perfectly . either way though , i believe i made my point . * i believe the top speed claim verified by guinness - mph , for the pre - production model in , however the claims of greater speed with the current model are suspect unless verified ? the veyron that was clocked by guinness was a full production model with all the standard accessories , and it has been shown repeatedly that consumer models can still do this speed , the ssc measured by guinness was a pre - production model specially stripped down for the test , none of the later production models have been tested by an independent te ster since , the problem people have is not can someone make a car faster than a veyron , since they obviously can ( at least one model of the ssc is ) , and many manufacturers have made one - offs or limited runs of cars that can go considerably faster , but is the standard production car they are currently making capable of this speed ? this is what i and many people doubt * so , do you have proof of these claims ( i . e . , reliable sources , not a forum post from some random nobody ) or are you just repeating here - say ? not only was the record ultimate aero a street legal production model , it was also a uc tioned off as a completely street legal car . it would not be street legal if it were not a production car , since pre - production cars are n't issued vins . * correct , the current model top speed is theoretical , and has always been listed as theoretical . * the veyron was not clocked by guinness , and bugatti still has yet to make a record run that conforms to the standard requirement of making one run in each direction within hour of each other . this is a standard requirement by the largest land speed record keeping organizations in the world , fia and sc ta , as well as the standard requirement by guinness too . this requirement has been met by mclaren when they set the not - so - production record ( pre - pro car , li mi ter removed , look it up ) with the f , this has been met by ko en ig se g g when they beat the fs record with the ccr , and this has now been met by ssc with the ultimate aero tt when they beat the c crs official record . * again , all veyron top speed runs have been in one direction , which makes them all ine lig able for the record claim . this requirement is in place to prevent a tail wind or a downward slope from artificially increasing the cars top speed . no matter how many times a veyron can hit the top speed in one run , it is still in elli gable and unofficial by all top speed recording standards . * the ko en gi se g g ccr was never independently tested for top speed . the mclaren f has never been independently tested for top speed . the jaguar x j ( cats removed , rev li mi ter removed ) has never been independently tested for top speed . the bugatti eb has never been independently tested for top speed . while this is a valid point it is an invalid reason to claim that the ultimate aero tt is n't the current fastest car in the world . * whatever problems people \" have \" with the ssc is ab sol out ley irrelevent to wikipedia , let alone any encyclopedia . this is based on facts , not opinions . the fact that all previous top speed production car record holders from the past decades have been verified by guinness makes all of these arguements asinine and irrelevent . ' doubts ' are not ' facts ' , so they do n't have any place on wikipedia unless they are from someone who actually matters ( automotive journalist or what have you ) . * i 'm removing this section in one ( ) week if it has n't been edited for npov and all quotes and statements cited to reliable sources . i do n't have any problem with the section ( npov 'd and cited of course ) what so ever , but it does n't belong unless it follows wikipedias standards . : the internet video that can be found on youtube is not credible . the image is split in half . on one half , you can see the pilot . on the other , you can see a computer animation . that is no evidence . that is as credible as a guinness world records certificate . the car still has to be shown , on camera , having its speed measured by a gps t ach ometer , un de credible circumstances . until then , the fastest production car is the bugatti veyron . what is not up to wikipedia 's standards are youtube videos to be considered credible evidence . if the ssc ultimate aero really is the world 's fastest supercar , like ssc claims , the brand will have no problem in lo aning one ultimate aero to be properly tested , on track , and having its top speed measured with a gps t ach ometer . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by * was the ssc ultimate aero the world fastest production car yes the guinness certificate proves it , so it is not alleged , rumoured or whatever it is the record holder ( unless something is now faster ) , is the veyron faster than this no , was the veyron ever the official record holder not sure , was is unofficially the holder yes it was at one time faster than the record holder at the time and was at the time a production car - but this was not verified by guinness . : so , in your perspective , the guinness certificate is the only , ultimate proof ? well , that says it all about you \" wikipedia standards \" . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : wikipedia standards : shelby super cars . com an youtube . com .

( \" they did n't release it until five years later , in \" ) . the cd booklet has the same implication . i agree that in the s nuts lyric book it says . so in at least one place he says , and in several places he says or implies . what might this mean ? that it was recorded in both years , say in december - january ? that it was recorded in , but the released mixes were mastered in ? that he came up with the overall concept and rough demos in , and recorded the final versions in ? that larry simply made a mistake ? or that he is attempting to rewrite history ? i 'd suggest that the latter is a bit of a stretch in this case . it is well documented that he was on tour in mid - late , which would suggest that if it was recorded in then it was earlier in the year . i do n't think the cover having \" on it means anything . it could be the year it was recorded sure . but it could be the year he expected it to be released , which would make sense if it was recorded in ( mid - late ) . it could also just be the year the photo was taken - it probably was n't the originally planned cover in any case . ( i believe the dylan mock up photo of larry and pamela in front of the fake fi replace was the originally planned cover ) . : but it was larry who wrote he handed it off to word in , when it was handed - off in . i heard that the dylan - esque image was to be the cover as well . : so perhaps this backs up ln 's claim of interference by word ? however , is interesting that ln did not replace the cover when the album was re - released ? ( ) . : \" but it was larry who wrote he handed it off to word in , when it was handed - off in \" - how do you know it was handed off in ? all i 've seen is one source which says it was recorded in , one which says ( and passed to word the same year ) , and several which only imply that it was recorded and handed over in . have i missed a source which indicates the hand over being in ? ( other than by implication of the lyric booklet saying it was recorded in i mean ) . : \" however , is interesting that ln did not replace the cover when the album was re - released ? \" - why would he replace it ? maybe you mean why did n't he revert to the originally planned cover ? because that showed him and pamela together , and they were divorced by the time the album came out , never mind by the time it was re - released . or am i missing the meaning of your question ? : nothing sinister was meant by my observation about the cover . i was thinking out loud . i have seen nothing in my research that suggested the cover is anything other than what it now is . i take your point about the release date and a change in his marital situation probably explaining any changes to which photo was used on the cover . ln still used the dylan replication photo on the inner sleeve , so was not trying to edit pamela out of his life . i noticed he sent greetings to sarah in the linear notes ( or was it the song book ) . ( ) : apologies if my wording came across badly . i was just wondering why you \" thought \" he might have changed the cover , and whether you had any sources to suggest so . i did n't think you were inferring anything , sinister or otherwise . anyway , perhaps to clarify , the cover originally was going to feature the photo of larry and pamela . he says so in the same e - mail response to d ds . i 'm sure he said somewhere else , though i ca n't remember where , that he changed the cover to the one we know because he felt it would be in con gr uous to depict an apparently happy marital scene , when in fact they were divorced by the time . i think you are correct that the photo remaining on the inner sleeve indicates that he was not writing pamela out of his life . also , i think the clues were left on the inner sleeve to help the ' album cycle detectives ' work out the meaning of the album . oh , and yes , he did name check ( a ) sarah in the liner notes . : no offence perceived by me at all . i have no knowledge of an album cover change for s nuts , although in his april post ln wrote : \" on s nuts the album on which the cover was to feature her and i sitting together \" implies the original intention was to have the bring it back home replica ( featuring pn and ln ) . if i find more explicit confirmation i will include , but would not rh all enge an insertion based on the e - mail evidence . ( ) . : second - why would allen even think of changing larry 's public e - mail response for a discrepancy of one year where he is talking about stuff from over twenty years previously ? walter , the only reason the birth certificate scan was updated was to satisfy you and your expressed doubts . all he did was show a larger portion of the same document . he did n't amend it or show an entirely different document . what is suspect about that ? someone ( yourself ) highlighted a possible short fall in his displayed evidence , so he displayed a bit more of the same evidence to \" plug the gap \" . i do n't understand why that is a big deal\n",

      "another interesting poe - related article ! thank you ! i have a few suggestions for improvement . i think the article can be better structured and there a few places that need clarification and expansion : * question about structure : i 'm not quite sure why the information about chi vers 's relationship with poe is not integrated into his life . it is odd to have chi vers die and then to read about his relationship with poe . can not the \" relationship with poe \" section be a subsection of the \" life \" ? : yes , it can ! : update : this has been done ; at least , i think i nailed your concern . it seems to work well this way , but further advice is welcome . * chi vers the writer : there a few books and articles on chi vers himself . i 'm curious why watts is not used at all for this article , for example . i also checked out chi vers on the mla database and found a few more articles . it seems it would be possible to write a little section on his poetry from these sources . for the article to broadly cover chi vers , i think it needs to address to his career as poet in a little more depth , not just his relationship with poe . : the only thing stopping me is access to the books . they are relatively rare finds and , as of now , i do n't have access to any particularly scholarly libraries . i hope to get my hands on them soon . : i 'm adding some info as i find time based on lombard 's book . hopefully , i 'll be able to grab one of the other books as well but it wo n't be any time soon , i 'm afraid ! : this section is improved and i 'm sure even more can be added to it . * the two soon separated due to alleged meddling by frances chi vers albert , the wife of the poet 's uncle , prior to the birth of their daughter in - what kind of meddling ? : ah , the typical nebulous inconclusive type of description infamous from this period . : if this is from a quotation , it might be best to include that quotation , then . that would reassure readers , i think . * it has also been suggested their separation was due to abuse - what kind of abuse ? : more of the same . : i was able to find a good clarification on this from lombard ! i think it may also explain the meddling better . : so , we do n't really know what kind of rumored abuse ? * though chi vers contributed to various newspapers and magazines , he was turned down by the southern literary messenger in march , which suggested he return to medicine and the \" lancet and pill - box \" . - what was turned down , exactly ? a story ? was he turned down for a position ? : sorry , i assumed it was clear . i 'm referring to a poem here , as he was a poet . * moreover , as attested to in an pamphlet titled \" search after truth , \" ( new york : scholar 's fac si mi les & reprints , ) - there seems to be a mixing of citation styles . there are other examples of harvard in the article - pick one style and stick with it . : sorry , i did n't do extensive work standardizing the references added by others . an easy fix . : i still see one in the \" after poe 's death \" section . * some pieces of information are repeated twice , such as the poe quote about chi vers being the \" best and worst poet \" . since the article is so short , i do n't think this kind of repetition is necessary . : i only noticed that for the first time today . i do n't think i intended the repetition ; will fix . * [ external link : this site ] makes me just the li tt lest bit nervous . they say that their pieces are fact - checked and written by qualified people , but then they do n't publish the name of the author so that can be verified . if the information available from this source is available from a more reliable source , i would use the more reliable source . if it is not available anywhere else , i would be skeptical of it . : those eno tes refs were added by another editor ; i tried to replace whenever i could with more legitimate sources . i can keep looking as we go along . : no eno tes references exist in the current version ! i 'm going to put this article on hold . if the editors need help obtaining sources , i can certainly help with that . : thanks very much for taking a look ! i 'm in the middle of a - mile move and currently living out of boxes so i may be inactive until i settle into the new job . i 'll do what i can ! : update : i have been able to acquire one of the chi vers biographies . i 'm waiting to get my hands on it now . i 'll be able to add lots of info from this book , i think . : awadewit , considering my lack of speed in addressing your concerns comments fully , feel free to fail ( i promise not to take it personally ) and i 'll take the time to further improve before submitting again . : mid night dre ary , i do n't really care about the \" seven day \" deadline . do n't sweat it . just keep improving the article and let me know when to re review it . i do n't want you to have to resubmit it ! wikipedia has no deadlines ! : mid night dre ary , i have been extraordinarily pleased to watch this page grow from the few sentences i wrote a year or so ago into the excellent article it is today , thanks mostly to your work . if there is anything that i may do to assist this article in receiving its nomination , please let me know . : thanks , al gab al ! got ta love these ( relatively ) obscure figures ! review ready awadewit , if you are still watching this page , i think it 's ready for your final review . i have followed your suggestions as best i could : i replaced the eno tes references , combined the discussion on his relationship with poe into the main biography , expanded information on his published works and writing style ( i 've also added more examples to his wikisource page ) , and was able to expand the overall article just a bit . i hope to get a hold of some other sources as i continue to build and improve this article but i think it 's ready for ga standards . i leave it in your capable hands . : i 'll do my best to get to it today ! : i agree that the article meets the ga standards . i look forward to reading is expanded version\n",

correct . sz il ard 's idea was that the tamper would contain the cobalt where a more \" traditional \" bomb would contain additional f is sion able materials . most radioactive fallout will p rec ip it ate out of the atmosphere in a matter of days , but the fallout created by a so - called cobalt bomb remains suspended in atmospheric gases , so that it remains radioactive until it de ca ys into a non - radioactive form . sz il and further proposed that the bomb itself should work by hydrogen fusion rather than the fam omi liar fission method , hence the term \" hydrogen - cobalt bomb \" . given the greater power of hydrogen fusion as opposed to fission , sz il ard estimated that \" hydrogen - cobalt bombs \" could destroy the population of the world . notice he says could , not would . and when he says that , he op ti mi zes the spacing of the de ton ations relative to one another . nonetheless , he 's right . you could indeed create a situation in which global wind patterns would carry the fallout around the globe and create enough fallout that the entire atmosphere of the earth would become le th ally contaminated in two or three years , and we 'd all die of radiation poisoning . sz il ard suggests that the cobalt would decay to a harmless isotope thereof in about twenty years , so presumably if you could shelter yourself underground for that long you could survive . more recent studies , however , suggest that it might take several times that long for the decay to take place , and that you might have to shelter yourself for fifty , a hundred or several hundred years . that part is disputed . the earth , as a correspondent has stated above , is a big place , but the power of hydrogen fusion is also big . the bottom line is that it 's a question of amount . \" the size of the moon \" is a strange estimate , given the power of fusion . tom covert iron into cobalt ? mv i think there has been a little mistake in the article . the way is written gives the impression that any iron ( and therefore steel ) would turn in great part or totally in cobalt . i think it would be better to clarify that cobalt turns into cobalt by the emission of neutrons , not any iron or steel , ( there is a mention in the article of natural cobalt being able to be converted even in large quantities by exposing cobalt to neutrons , not iron or steel ) . many nuclear weapons tested used steel cases and they did not all turn into cobalt ( ivy mike , for example ) . some cobalt results as part of the fission products and due to the use of cobalt in some alloys , but it is not all or in great part cobalt . the mention of iron turning into cobalt can be kept , but it could probably be stressed that it would be a small amount , like other fission products . that also could point out as the next sentence intends that some nuclear weapon designs could increase the amount of cobalt by using cobalt , rather than steel or other casing which would not produce much cobalt . i think that change could be made . [ wiki link : mike vel as quez ] : this appears to have already been fixed . if you feel there 's still a problem , please indicate where it is , because the section discussing cobalt bombs indicates that the source of cobalt is cobalt . by the way , you might want to consider creating a user account ; it will give you a user page to put any personal information you desire , and a user talk page where others can get a hold of you . thanks for the advice , i will consider creating an account . do n't worry , there is no problem , just thought that the mention of iron turning into cobalt should not have been changed completely for cobalt , only specified that the amount of cobalt would be very small with iron ( and would n't be a more significant risk than other fission products ) , and then contrast it with the risk of cobalt being used in a bomb .

sorry . - there is a great deal of controversy among the scholars regarding the origin of the ma ur yans . following are some of the different views regarding the origin of the ma ur yans that are listed below . according to s po oner , ma ur yans were persians because the social , religious and political conditions of india and persia of that time were similar . but most of the scholars disagree with this view . according to the second view , which is based on brahman literature , ma ur yans were shudras . different brahman books had given different versions about the ma ur yans . pur ans : along with the mention of the destruction of sh ish un aga dynasty and establishment of nanda dynasty , pur anas also mentions that after this shudras will rule the country . however , this sentence is applicable to n and as and after the destruction of sh ish un aga dynasty there were several dynasties that were definitely brahman as . hence the view does not seem to be correct . commentaries of pur anas : according to a commentator of vishnu pur an , chandra gupta was the son of nanda through a wife named mur a . but this view is not acceptable because nowhere in the pur ans , chandra gupta has been referred as belonging to nanda dynasty . moreover , according to panini ` s ` v yak aran ` , the word ` maurya ` has not originated from the word ` mur a ` . mu dr ar ak shas : vis hak ha d atta wrote ` mu dr ar ak shas ` between th and th century . ` mu dr ar ak shas ` mentions chandra gupta as son of nanda king and is described as ` v ri kh als ` . according to some writers ` v ri kh als ` were shudras but further study and research has shown that persons condemning caste system were called ` v ri kh al ` . now here in one of the dramas chandra gupta has been described as son of nanda through a legitimate wife . it , therefore , appears that the drama tist described him as the son of illegitimate wife of low caste . ` k ath a sar it sag ar ` and ` bri hat k ath a man j ari ` : these are written by som dev and ch ha em endra . ` k ath a sar it sag ar ` and ` bid hat k ath a man j ari ` respectively , describe chandra gupta as belonging to nanda dynasty . but there are many ancient books and scholars . they doubt their authenticity . thus it can be seen that there are contradictory stories regarding the caste of chandra gupta . kautilya ` ar th as astra ` : according to kautilya ` s ar th as astra , chan ak ya crowned chandra gupta after destroying the nanda dynasty . being a brahman , chan ak ya was a staunch follower of ` var nash ram ` system and would not consent to make a shudra king in place of n and as whom he had gone all out to destroy . dr . rad ha kum ud mo ok er ii says , \" it is thus quite absurd to suppose that kau t li ya who was out to rescue this dharma or system from the outrage inflicted upon it by a shudra sovereignty , could have chosen as his agent in the fulfillment of his sacred mission a person of the same dis qualification . he could not con se crate to sovereignty one shudra in place of another . \" thus it is quite incorrect to say that the mauryas were shudra . according to the third view , ma ur yans were kshatriyas . this view is based upon the following liter ature buddhist literature : the entire buddhist literature describes ma ur yans as kshatriyas . according to ` maha vamsa ` , chandra gupta was a kshatriya called maurya whom chan ak ya crowned as king after putting an end of the nanda dynasty . ` maha bodhi vamsa ` describes chandra gupta as being born in the royal dynasty of mari yan agara . there is also the mention of the kshatriya clan known as the mari yas of p ip ph ali vana in ` di gha nik aya ` . moreover , ` div yad ana ` describes bin dus ara was lawfully anointed kshatriya king . there is a reference in ` maha par in ir vana ` , which says that when lord buddha attained nirvana , the mari yas of p ip ph ali vana sent a message . \" you and we are kshatriyas and so we also enjoy ari ght to have a share in the remains of lord buddha . \" this quote further confirms that ma ur yans were kshatriyas . jain literature : according to ` par isi s tha par vana ` written by hem chandra , chandra gupta belonged to a community who were famous as ` re arers of royal pe ac oc ks ` . hari b hara tika also lends its support to this view . ` pun y ash ra va k ath a kosh ` clearly mentions chandra gupta as kshatriya . evidence of the foreigners : according to di odor us , \" par us informed alexander that the king of the gang ari dai ( nanda king ) was a man of quite worthless character and held in no respect as he was thought to be the son of a barber . \" the famous historian , pl u tar ch has written that and ro kot tos or chandra gupta when he was only a young man had seen alexander himself . he had told alexander that he could easily win the nanda king because people \" hated and despised the king because of his low and mean origin . the great historian justin also wrote about the humble birth of chandra gupta . but his reference of humble birth does not mean that he was a shudra , what actually is meant is the weak economic conditions of the family of the chandra gupta . thus the foreign sources do not prove that chandra gupta was a shudra or was of low origin . archeological evidence : the excavated portion of the ashoka ` s pillar at n and an garh contains an emblem of peacock . the st up a at san chi also has several statues of pe ac oc ks . besides this , ashoka ` s inscriptions also mentions peacock . thus it is also said that people living in lands full of pe ac oc ks , were called ` maurya ` . so it can be inferred that the origin of the ` maurya ` is not from the word ` mur a ` . in view of the above statements and evidence supporting them , it can be concluded that mauryas were not su dras . the view that ma ur yans were kshatriyas does not only seem to be proper , reasonable and correct but there is sufficient reliable evidence to support it as well . please update . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : you appear to be repeating yourself . it has previously been explained to you why your the sources that you have ( again ) provided are not acceptable . you may be correct but you need to find some [ wiki link : wp : rs reliable sources ] . that 's just the way wikipedia works , sorry - dear sir , i am sorry for dist ur bi bg you time to time , but can you please specify this [ wiki link : reliable sources ] ? ub maurya preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : wrong link you want [ wiki link : wp : reliable sources ] . follow that link , and it will explain . the quick summary is that all information in wikipedia must be verifiable in sources that are reliable , meaning the have a reputation for fact - checking , accuracy , etc . the best examples for an article of this type are academic journal articles or books published by reliable academic presses . other sources are possible , and if you 're not sure , you can ask . in other words , we ca n't just \" take your word \" that something is or is n't true instead , you need to show us an expert source that says those things . note , for example , that di odor us and pl u tar ch are not reliable sources , but modern historians publishing in good journals commenting on what those ancient historians wrote could be considered reliable sources . then sir , kautilya 's ` ar th as astra ` , buddhist literature , jain literature and archeological evidence are must be a reliable sources . if possible kindly check these evidences . as per the views mentioned in these evidences that ma ur yans were kshatriyas does not only seem to be proper , reasonable and correct but there is sufficient reliable evidence to support it as well . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : please can you confirm that you have read [ wiki link : wp : rs the reliable sources policy ] ? neither kautilya nor buddhist jain literature are compliant with that . therefore , if you have read it then perhaps we have a fundamental problem , which could be that you are unfortunately unable fully to comprehend things that are written in clear english . if this is the case and english is , for example , not your first language then it might be sensible to consider contributing to a wiki that is produced in what ever is your first language . there are , for example , tamil and hindi wikipedias . : archaeological studies may be ok but it depends on the context : which studies , where , undertaken by whom , published in what , drawing what conclusions ? you need to be much , much more specific . - some reliable sources : epi gra phia indica , ii , maha par in ni bh ana sutta , page ub maurya preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : yes ! that is a reliable source , the only issue being that each volume deals with a single area ( i think ) & so any statement relying on it may have to be qualified slightly . anyway , i 'll try to find it on gbooks and take a look . - : do you know of an online source for this book ( epi gra phia ) ? i can find many of the volumes at gbooks but have not yet spotted volume . - sir , this site might be help you [ externa link : http

ni bh ana sutta , page . thanks in advance for your consideration . ub maurya preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by dear sir , please update . ub maurya preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by sir , i have provided reliable sources like : epi gra phia indica , ii , maha par in ni bh ana sutta , page , bhagwan buddha ke sam kal in an u y ayi ta tha bo ddha k end ra - by tri pat k acharya , ma hop ad hy aya bhi k su buddha mi tra ( p . - ) and india from indus valley civilisation to mauryas - by g yan s war up gupta ( p . ) ub maurya preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : you can continue to throw as many sources at this point as you like but i for one will not be responding further because the entire issue has already been dealt with . sometimes you have to accept that there is no single \" right \" opinion regarding things such as varna , dynastic origins and the like . that situation is unlikely to change any time soon . - ah lu w alia remove ah lu w alia from chandravanshi list . : why ? : there are no references added in [ wiki link : ah lu w alia ] article about their [ wiki link : rajput ] status . they are only claiming . more generally . in response to a few of the comments above , and having looked at the article , it appears that a large portion of it is not [ wiki link : wp : v verified ] . the \" original royal rajput clans \" is verified by tod , which is fine since it 's a historical claim . however , basically the entire rest of the article is unsourced . now , on the clans that are linked ( that is , have their own wikipage ) , as long as their rajput status is verified on the target article by a reliable source , then they do n't have to be verified here . however , if its not , and for those clans that do n't have their own wikipage , the information really should n't be here . wikipedia requires verifiability , period . furthermore , this needs to be verification by reliable secondary sources that is , quotations from car vings from years ago do not suffice ( unless verified by modern research scholarship ) . so , very soon , it 's time to give this article a thorough purging . however , before i start to do so , i figured i 'd give any of the regular editors here time to add any references you knew of . in particular , in the references section , there are references listed ( bulleted ) that are n't linked to inline citations ; presumably those verify something in the article , but without the inline citation , its impossible to tell what they supposedly verify ; if anyone knows what they should link to , please make the connection . if anyone has references but does n't know how to add them , you can post them here and tell me where they go , and i 'd be happy to do the formatting . i know that once i start the process there 's going to be an uproar . but the simple matter is that wikipedia 's rules on [ wiki link : wp : v verifiability ] are n't op tional they 're one of of our core policies . since being or not being a rajput obviously has huge psychological and social consequences , its not hard to see why it is beneficial to list de - list clans for reasons outside of wp 's policies . but we need to move , as much as possible , towards full verification . i hope everyone can agree with and work towards this goal . : agree entirely with the principle of what q wr y xian states above . it really is a fundamental tenet of wikipedia . i would , however , prefer to see the sources in any linked articles being double - checked before saying that it is ok to rely on those links . there is a borderline [ wiki link : wp : circular ] issue if this is not done . - : always a good plan . my thought was to go after the low - hanging fruit first that is , provisionally \" accept \" anything sourced that is n't obviously a non - rs ( like a blog or some such ) ; then , later ( most likely much later , given how extensive even this one article is , worry about checking the quality of sources . as questionable issues arise , i would , of course , raise them on the relevant article talk page . to clarify one thing for everyone involved : i am not indian , and i know almost nothing about the indian caste system ( and , in fact , knew nothing about it until i stumbled on a few pages in wikipedia within the past year ) . this , i think , actually makes it easier for me to approach these articles , because i 'm not hampered by any problems with , \" but everyone knows that . \" or \" they 're just trying to make us look good bad whatever . \" since wikipedia needs to be verified , not true , i think it often helps to have editors without a lot of subject matter knowledge take a look at information and pare it down , using wikipedia 's principles rather than any real - world agenda . this means , of course , that , as i mentioned above , that if any of the other editors here do ' know of sources , i 'll have to rely on you to provide them so that we can verify everything . : so , no adjustments since i last checked about weeks ago . well , it looks like this needs trimming . also , it turns out that , after reviewing the available info , tod does not qualify as a reliable source . putting that list here gives far too much prominence to information that is at best questionable , and more likely fatally fla e wd . i 'm going to start by removing that whole section . : i , for one , will be extremely curious to see how we end up picking what named clans are listed here . is there some plan for what to do with clans that ( verifiably ) claim rajput status but are not accepted as such by other rajputs ? i 'm also curious to see how long this page will need semi - protection for , what with ips coming in to say \" hey , the foo ians are n't rajputs ! removing ( along with eight footnotes ) \" . : upon input from mv elsewhere , there may be value in adding tod back in , but just not the way it was before . mv , do you have a secondary source that says something like \" many groups have historically relied on tod 's list of [ wiki link : royal races ] as a list of rajput clans , but tod has more recently been rejected as not being reliable . \" or anything even vaguely similar ? poor footnoting this article still lacks decent footnotes , although some sources are mentioned and there has been a general tag for the issue since july . i think that this situation has persisted for long enough . i shall make one more attempt to locate english language versions of the sources listed that have not been incorporated as footnoted citations and should that fail then i intend to start cutting it back some time in december . given that the article has averaged around views each month , i really do not see that there can be any reasonable objection to this course of action . nonetheless , do feel free to comment & ( better ) to fix the thing . - edit request on january i would like to include ' saini ' clan under the chandravanshi heading . the saini clan has also been mentioned here . [ externa link : http : en . wikipedia . org wiki chandravanshi ] saini ( punjabi : ) ( hindi : pronunciation ( help info ) is a rajput clan . sainis , also known as sho or saini ( hindi : ) [ ] in pur anic literature , are now found by their original name only in punjab and in the neighboring states of haryana , jammu and kashmir and him achal pradesh . they trace their descent from rajputs of the yad u vanshi sur as ena lineage , originating from yad ava king sh ur as ena , who was the grandfather of both krishna and the legendary p and ava warriors . sainis relocated to punjab from mathura and surrounding areas over different periods of time . : someone has been adding stuff about saini all over the place recently . i 'll check the sources because when i first looked they were not great & i asked for better ones to be provided . if all is ok then i will add the content for you . - : sorry , but the citations in the [ wiki link : chandravanshi ] article were not great at all . we need a source that explicitly says \" saini claim to be descended from the lunar dynasty \" or something very similar . none of this messing around with the ancient sho or saini clan etc because the connection between the two groups is not at all certain , just as the connection between yadavs yadavas and ahi rs ab hi ras is not certain . do you know of such a source ? - edit request on march [ wiki link : d ha kar ] is also a branch of [ wiki link : ag ni vanshi ] [ wiki link : rajput ] s : you would need to provide a [ wiki link : wp : rs reliable source ] for this , and i note that the [ wiki link : d ha kar ] article is not only unsourced but is presently up for deletion . - sourcing unless someone can sort out the sourcing for this article fairly soon , i will be reducing it to something near a stub . the { more footnotes } tag has been present for a long time and i am not even convinced that the sources listed cover much of the content shown . - edit request on may i just want to add dhudhi in the last in clans of rajputs in the ag ni van sha just like bag hel a bag hi al bha kr al chauhan de ora dor hon khar al . dhudhi . thats all i want to do . i want to increase history about dhudhi family please publish this . i shall be ver thankful to you for this act of kindness . ahmad hassan preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : please provide a reliable source to verify that dhudhi is a rajput clan . edit request : chauhan is a gur jara clan . please remove it frm dis article . : no [ wiki link : wp : rs reliable source ] provided - declined .

polaron in response at to my question at says he does not now object to there being a separate article on the historic district . doncram : resolved then . i 've started the historic district article as an nrhp stub , replacing the redirect . : ftr , i 've expanded the article slightly with some historical info on the village and moved it to [ wiki link : stafford hollow , connecticut ] . as i see it , the village is the primary topic , and the fact that it 's an historic district is secondary . : i guess ftr for the record ? thank you orlady for adding material and for returning here to mention your moving renaming it . the way this has been done , there is a redirect from the nrhp name for the place , and there is no issue about disambiguation pages ( as is the case for some other ct hd articles ) . also i can imagine that there will not be great difference between \" stafford hollow \" vs . the historic district , and here i do not object to it being moved to the village name . i have , however , revised the article slightly to include \" stafford hollow historic district \" in bold in the lede , to explain to some readers why they arrived at this article . by the way , though , i wonder what is a \" village \" in connecticut ? is it a taxing district or does it otherwise have any formal boundaries ? it would improve the article perhaps to provide an informative wikilink for what a village in connecticut is . thanks . : as a general rule , \" villages \" in connecticut have no legal status . some have post offices , however , and a few might be treated as census cd ps . typically , villages in connecticut were formed either as the town center ( most of this type date from the th and th century ) of an agricultural town or as an industrial village inhabited by the employees of a factory ( most examples of this type date from the th and th century ) . : thanks . i also found my way back to one old discussion , about georgetown , in which linking \" village \" to [ wiki link : administrative divisions of connecticut village , neighborhood , section of town ] was advised . it explains asserts that in in ct , villages have little definition . which i think would usually make it difficult to assess how much overlap there is between one and a historic district . but , anyhow , will try linking the word \" village \" to that in this stafford hollow , connecticut article now . thanks again for your followup . : villages are not well defined but in cases where the surrounding territory is rural and no other villages are in the immediate vicinity , it is quite obvious where a village ends . other times , there are obvious geographic features that delineate villages . villages that are prin ic ip al communities are also marked with road signs when you enter them via a state highway . finally , it is quite easy to see how a village and historic district are related if one can plot the polygon vertices of a historic district ( found in the nris database ) and overlay them on a map of the area . : polaron has described the \" village \" situation well , imo . it 's likely that the stafford hollow village and historic district are one and the same ( identical ) . however , the link to [ wiki link : administrative divisions of connecticut village , neighborhood , section of town ] is an ok addition to the stafford hollow article . : polaron , what set of polygon vertices are you referring to ? do you have the nrhp database in some form not generally available to the public ? and if it is publicly available , how can it be seen for this village ? perhaps your judgments here are elsewhere are informed by information you have not shared . i am vaguely aware that there is some nrhp info available in a google earth map layers system , but i am not aware that provides polygon maps of historic districts . anyhow , do you have the ability to create a map showing the hd boundaries ? that would certainly help resolve many questions . would you be willing to create a map here and or in other situations ? i would greatly prefer to help sort out what is correct information and to include maps into the relevant articles . if you download the access database file ( . m db file ) , in addition to the main database , there are extra tables for point coordinates , cen tro id coordinates of polygons , and vertex coordinates of polygons . i suspect this is also the case for the . d bf file but i have not looked at that yet . the google earth layer shows you the point coordinates and the cen tro id coordinates of polygons , but no polygon data . now , the coordinate information in the nris database is in [ wiki link : universal transverse mer cator utm ] format . in order to overlay that on existing maps , one needs to convert each vertex ( usually to vertices for each di str cit ) to the usual latitude and longitude system . to create the polygon , you just connect the vertices in the order listed . i have attempted to make maps of historic districts from this data but not being a gis expert , i was able only able to make one after some effort and i am not confident about the accuracy of the coordinate transformation . if you know of someone good at gis stuff , the data is there and making maps is possible . pomfret street historic district * [ wiki link : pomfret street historic district ] ( some previous discussion at [ wiki link : talk : connecticut route ] , [ wiki link : talk : pomfret , connecticut ] ) currently a redirect to a section for this hd within [ wiki link : pomfret , connecticut ] article . i previously stated i would be okay with that , but upon further thought i would prefer this to be broken out into a separate article . the pomfret article can should link to this separate article . i think it 's better to start the historic district article , which will cover only a portion of pomfret . among other things , this would provide for its talk page to have a reqphoto for the historic district . i requested the nrhp application for this district a long time ago but have not received it . : a picture of the historic district would be the same as a picture of the town center . as i said , this is a town center historic district and is better treated as integrated with the town . it just makes for a better narrative . : i 'm not too sure , but is n't pomfret , like other ct towns , a large town encompassing several villages hamlets ? also i would prefer to develop the hd article separately so that it can list contributing properties . historic district articles can be developed well to attract photos and describe historic , contributing properties , if allowed to be separate . for models , see any of several historic district articles by such as [ wiki link : new bedford historic district ] and [ wiki link : central troy historic district ] . i asked for but have not received a copy of the nrhp application document which would provide basis for a large expansion this way . it is fine for the pomfret town article to describe the historic district too , but i do not agree that redirecting the hd to the town is best even now , and with more material the separation will be necessary , so i do n't think it is fair to insist that the hd article can not exist . : umm , that 's true of all towns ( even cities ) . it 's just that in more urban areas villages are more known as neighborhoods or sections . when it does come to a point that the description of the town center has sufficient distinctive content that makes it too big for the town article , then we can think about splitting it . as currently written , there is only boiler - plate content in the pomfret article . : i have explained some other reasons , in other discussion sections , why having split out hd articles created upfront , and kept , helps in some ways . it is fine for you to have a different subjective opinion about what is best , though . i wonder , though , do you have a source you have not shared on the pomfret nrhp district ? you speak very confidently that \" a picture of the historic district would be the same as a picture of the town center \" , where i do n't see information supporting that in the pomfret , connecticut article . in fact , the article asserts \" pomfret has no formal town center \" ! before it later asserts \" the main town center is listed as a historic district on the u . s . national register of historic places . \" i would like to see some evidence of what is the town center , hopefully in a map that could be used to create a map for the article . : pomfret actually two centers . one was the original settlement and the other was several miles away that developed as a result of the railroad . in modern times , these two have essentially merged and is now the densely settled part of town . the nrhp district encompasses the areas surrounding the main highway connecting the two traditional centers . what kind of information should a map show that would indicate a locality is the town center ?

( outdent ) okay , i see that you deleted the separate article by merging material from it into the goshen article . i have just now reverted your redirection . as i have already indicated by my opening this discussion section , i believe there is merit in having the separate hd article started sooner , now , rather than later . i interpret your redirection in the face of my statements here already was a bold step ; i have now reverted that . this time , per [ wiki link : wikipedia : bold , revert , discuss cycle ] process , let us please discuss it rather than edit war . i set up this area to discuss this and related cases centrally , and let 's discuss here please . it is also your prerogative to open an afd on the article , but please do n't revert it to a redirect , prod it , or speedy - delete it , as i am legitimate contesting for the notability of this article . my reasons for creating and wanting to keep the separate article include : * ( ) it is part of building the wikipedia coverage of nrhp properties and districts in ct . the historic district is notable on its own , and there is extensive documentation available that would allow it to be grown to a size larger than can be reasonably kept in the town article . i do n't have the nrhp documentation in hand , but if it is like all other nrhp hd documentation , it will include a list of contributing properties and considerable detail . developing a historic district article with photos and sections on many of these properties is a reasonable goal . the article now , while short , is a legitimate wikipedia article already . * ( ) keeping it separate makes it available to me and others to add material and grow it , free from others ' legitimate editorial control over the goshen town article which would tend to fight against some details that are appropriate for the hd article but not the town article . * ( ) keeping it separate allows for a reqphoto to be included in the talk page of the hd article and for the photo request to show up in ct - wide reqphoto lists , in proper conjunction with coordinates that are in the article . if the reqphoto is just left in a talk page for a redirect , the coordinates are disconnected , and map - based views of photos needed in connecticut will not show this district . if the reqphoto is put into the goshen article , it will not naturally and clearly call for photos of the historic district , and or it will compete unnecessarily with other goshen photos needed . the most efficient and direct way to call for photos is by reqphoto in the talk page of the separate hd article . * ( ) keeping it separate keeps the disambiguation page [ wiki link : goshen historic district ] in compliance with [ wiki link : wp : mosdab ] style guidelines policy . by guideline policy , disambiguation pages are supposed to include only links to actual wikipedia articles ( with exception under [ wiki link : mos : dab rl ] for certain articles that are redlinks and will be created ) , and they are supposed to show the actual article names without hiding article locations by pipe links or redirects . in the current disambiguation page , [ wiki link : goshen historic district ( goshen , connecticut ) ] is properly shown . if the article is redirected , then the disambiguation page could perhaps be updated to show a link to the town article instead , with explanation that there is a goshen historic district included in the town . however , this causes unnecessary work now which would only have to be reversed later when the hd article is re - separated . i would strongly prefer to complete the nrhp disambiguation nation - wide once , in intended - to - be - final form , rather than set up future work . * ( ) i want to avoid future disputes about when the hd article is sufficiently developed to stand on its own . i do n't want to personalize this unduly , but there has been repeated tension between myself and about nrhp places in ct , and i think occasionally also between polaron and others . polaron , in june apparently , went through and made numerous hd and other links in the ct nrhp list - articles into redirects to towns . since then , polaron has repeatedly taken a position that separate nrhp articles should not yet be allowed and has been overriding my own efforts to begin to develop articles . often in the course of my developing nrhp disambiguation pages nation - wide , i have created stub articles for ct nrhp districts to support disambiguation pages . my experience in - ct cases has been that polaron notices these and immediately reacts to eliminate them . in most of these cases , when i start there is no mention of the nrhp in the town article to which a redirect points . for example , there was no mention of goshen historic district in the [ external link : goshen article 's then - current version ] . i do n't think anyone can argue that it is unreasonable for me to replace the redirect with a stub article that includes the nrhp infobox and a couple sentences . polaron has intervened to eliminate the stub articles , which is , i believe , unnecessarily negative . although i expect hope polaron does not mean it , i personally experience it as unfriendly and controlling , and i project that other would - be editors of ct nrhp articles can also experience it in that way . in the process , polaron has built material content in various ct town and cdp articles , which is fine and good . however , that material could be added to the town articles anyhow , and a whole lot of repeated dispute could be avoided , if the separate nrhp articles are allowed to exist from the get - go . i would prefer not to set up standards and argue them , about when a hd article should be allowed to be separate and when it should not , and to have to repeatedly request the intervention of other editors to judge and so on . i would prefer not to set up a special tribunal for all these cases , etc . on the other hand , polaron , i do n't see your authority for asserting that the goshen historic district \" is more appropriately discussed in the town article \" . you are certainly free to mention the historic district in the town article , and use available information about it to enhance the town article , but that does not preclude growing a different article for the wikipedia - notable nrhp - listed historic district . in the town article , the emphasis has to be different . actually i would argue that the assertion now in the town article that \" the town center was listed as a historic district on the national register of historic places in \" is even a little bit suspect , is not perfectly well supported . this is not a major complaint , and i would not strike it from the town article being worked on by a local wikipedian , and i would not bother to put a citation needed tag on it . but in fact there is no source given that the historic district is the town center . in other cases it is more true , but even here i think it is somewhat the case , that shoe hor ning the ct hd material into the town article and revising the town article to assert it is the proper place , is a bit argumentative . the ar gu men ta tiveness is reflected in awkward writing in the town article which detracts from the town article . instead of two , mutually supporting , perfectly well referenced wikipedia articles , you get instead one article with questionable assertions . i do want to acknowledge there is subjectivity in judgment of whether , at the present time , it is better for wikipedia articles to have a short stub ct hd article separate from a town article that may be adapted to cover the limited material that is at first available . polaron is entitled to have a different opinion about what looks best for wikipedia readers currently . however , i believe that it is better for the development of wikipedia to allow the stub articles to start and to be grown , and in this goshen historic district article case i argue , for all of the reasons above , to keep the separate article . if you do n't like the current stub article , then [ wiki link : wp : sofixit ] please by obtaining the nrhp nomination documents and other materials , and develop it further so that it meets your personal criteria for being a good standalone article . and , also , i would like the opportunity to just work ahead on developing this and other nrhp articles . : again , the historic district is the town center . what makes you believe it is n't ? where is the town green ? where is the central post office ? where are town offices ? where is the library ? where is the congregation church ? whatever made the historic district significant is a result of the history of the town . it 's not that i do n't like the stub article but there is nothing about the historic district that does n't apply to the town center . : if you are do n't dislike the stub article , then we have no problem , but your adding a merger proposal to the stub just now suggests you do n't like it . i 'm confused , what do you want ? to discuss the boundaries of the town center and the boundaries of the historic district requires time and research and maps . it is premature to argue that the town center and the historic district are so in ex tri cable that they can not be discussed in separate wikipedia articles , and there is no town center article , anyhow . your merger proposal is to merge the hd with the town - wide article . also , you do not have sources and maps to make a supported assertion in mainspace that the town center and the historic district are the same . i do n't disagree with your intuition that it is quite possible that the boundaries of the town center may substantially be the same as the hd . ( or , do you actually have sources that you can share that show the town center on a map , and or which show the historic district on a map ? ) but please see reasons , above about why i wish to keep the hd article separate . : i do n't dislike stub articles as a general rule . but in this particular case , the town center is better described in the town article . the histories are identical . : i 've been meaning to say , in this and other cases , there is a difference between the nrhp historic district vs . a town center , in that the nrhp historic district is a modern , current thing . it usually contains some elements that are > years old , but it consists of only what is currently present . an article about an hd has to focus on what is still present , although it can mention prior history . also , historic districts are usually irregular shapes which include par cel s that have old buildings , while often skipping newer intrusions . from my experience seeing hd maps elsewhere , they often are sort of random in appearance , sometimes from the fact that owners of properties may be allowed to opt in or out from being included in the district . a village or town center for a ct town has a longer history , so an article about it is not focussed about the same history . and village or town clearly includes modern intrusions such as strip malls and - s which the historic district hopefully avoids . so , i disagree , the histories are not identical , and nor are the current physical contents . : of course the boundaries are not exactly the same but that does n't mean we should discuss them as separate articles . it just makes more sense to have a unified historical narrative . try expanding one and see if you find something that does n't apply to the history of the town . also , there are no strip malls in goshen center and this particular historic district is significant for late th century architecture , which is when the town developed . : i have stated several reasons why it makes sense , from the general perspective of building the wikipedia , to have a separate article sooner rather han later . and i am trying , albeit slowly , to build these . i am ham strung by lack of ready access to nrhp documents . here also you speak as if with confidence about what are the historic district boundaries . can you provide a map of the hd boundaries here , too ; that would be extremely relevant to add to this dicussion . southport historic district in the course of disambiguation work on north carolina nrhp articles , i find it necessary to create [ wiki link : southport historic district ] disambiguation . it links naturally to [ wiki link : southport historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] , which turns out to be a redirect set up in to link to [ wiki link : southport ( fairfield ) ] . currently the southport town article shows a map of the town within ct that is far larger than what i imagine is the historic district . the town article does not explicitly name or integrate discussion of the southport hd . its lede is : \" southport is a distinct section of the town of fairfield , connecticut . settled in , it has been designated as a historic district because of its harbor , churches , public buildings , and the home ste ads of some of the first families in the area . \" actually i expect that statement is inaccurate : i do not believe that the town as a whole has been designated as a historic district , or that it is even close . currently i do n't have a lot of info on the historic district , but i know it is notable on its own and that it merits an article . neither article is well enough developed , actually , for a reader to know the boundaries of either , and it is not possible to judge the overlap ; it is just my belief based on experience with other town and nrhp historic district pair ings that there will be significant differences here . i choose to proceed to build structure by creating the ct nrhp hd article as a good short stub article with its implicit call for expansion . : polaron redirected the article i created , which i experience as somewhat unfriendly , and i have reverted polaron 's edit . please discuss here . the reasons , which i gave for another case , above , probably all apply . : there is no need for duplication . the village article is a perfect vessel to describe the historic district . : again , why do you need two separate articles discussing the same thing ? : ( i re ordered and rein den ted the sequence of comments above in the order they were posted . ) : to others , there is some confusion here , because i relied upon the existing southport article to assess that southport was a huge area ( i was misled by an un labelled map in the article ) . and polaron has revised the southport article now to make it look largely the same as the hd article . what i did was fine . polaron , it seems to me that you are taking work from nrhp articles to improve corresponding village town cdp articles , which is fine and good . however , you do not have to tear out the contribution of another editor ( me ) in the process . also , your removal of the separate page puts other structure in wikipedia out of wack , namely the disambiguation page . are you intending to fix that ? i do n't really believe this would be the case , but are you trying to claim credit for yourself in some way ? i read what you write here , and i get that you do n't like the separate hd article . would you please do me the favor of reading what i write . note i have stated legitimate reasons , which you have not addressed . i may not be able to watch this and discuss here for much more today , but i will return and respond later . sincerely , : all your reasons do not require a separate village and historic district article . your entire contribution is still in the village article . i have torn nothing out . : polaron , it is clearly edit warring for you to again , just now , to remove the article which i had created . please stop that . i have been trying to edit constructively in that article , in the southport article ( where you also reverted my work ) , in the talk page of the southport article , and here . i think i have been friendly and respectful enough of your views , but i experience what you are doing now as being [ wiki link : wp : disruptive ] in a bad way . i will return the southport historic district article to how i developed it , and i ask you not to delete it again . : it 's not being deleted . clearly you have n't been listening to me . whatever you can say about the district applies to the village . also , it takes two parties to edit war . ( outdent ) as an objective outsider here , i agree with polaron on this one . we do n't need two very short stubby two - sentence articles ( which you , doncram , are known for creating ) when we can combine the two using redirects . what \" other structure \" are you talking about , doncram , that this throws out of whack ? if you 're talking about the [ wiki link : southport historic district ] dab page , what 's wrong with it ? are you concerned that the two links on the page are n't going to look the same because one will have a city , state dab and the other wo n't ? well frankly , dab pages do n't have to be uniform ; they just have to disambiguate . linking to the town page instead of the district page wo n't throw anything out of whack . : i am entirely proud of having created thousands of stub nrhp articles in wikipedia , which for example helped build some perfectly good coverage of every u . s . national historic landmark . thousands of the articles that i started as stubs have been further improved by myself and by many others . i continue to create stub articles where helpful and necessary for supporting the disambiguation of nrhps nation - wide , so that a ) readers will be more able to find nrhp places they look for , and b ) more importantly so that editors creating nrhp articles , anywhere , will be able to start them confidently at a permanently feasible names to hold them , within the structure of a comprehensive system of list - articles and dis am bi gation pages that is almost completely set up now . it is not meant or maintained as a rigid system ; please note that i am very supportive of redirecting from initial nrhp names to existing or new articles about lighthouses and many other kinds of topics where it is established that the nrhp place is essentially the same as a place going by a different common name . i also make it a point to create stub nrhp articles to capture semi - complicated bits of information , like boundary increase situations or like nris error situations , so that editors will not have to struggle in the absence of clear information , later . : but dude man fel lab ra , you understand what is going on here entirely wrong if you think that i want for there to be two very short stubby two - sentence articles . do you think what i did in [ wiki link : list of rh ps in ms ] , where i am sure i created numerous stub articles , or anywhere else , is bad work ? i certainly want for the ct historic district articles to be developed . and , in many cases that can and will eventually involve merger with a village , cdp , town or other community article . however , i object to merging them without having adequate information to know what is the historic district and what is the village . it happens that in ct we do not have online copies of nrhp documents which would help a lot . : in my experience with polaron , he has edit warred to merge hds with town articles about large towns having multiple village areas , where it almost certainly will not make sense to keep the hd article merged in , where in fact it will make sense to re split them out if they have been merged . in some other cases i have concurred with mergers . but in too many cases for me to ignore , polaron has argued by edit warring , by overriding my work , rather than by discussing and by adding sources that bring new information out into common knowledge . here , in the [ wiki link : southport ( fairfield ) ] article , for example , he has added in assertions that may well be correct but are without sources . note that some editor tagged the southport article with \" unreferenced \" . the sources now in the article include the generic nris reference which does not speak to overlap at all , and other sources that seem to support minor points , such as some actor 's association with the community . at this point , i do n't care to have my work ripped out in favor of an unreferenced article , by polaron 's subjective decision . and it is not established to my satisfaction , anyhow , that eventually good wikipedia coverage of southport hd and the southport village will not best be as separate articles . so i do n't now concur with the structure change that polaron has edit warred towards implementing . i would prefer for both the town and hd articles to be kept open and to be developed with sources . if there are two articles for now , then it certainly would make sense for the village article to wikilink to the hd article , and for it not to carry highly overlapping information . i contributed to the village article , but polaron reverted some of my edits , and i am not going to edit war on the village article to bring it into complementary , reader - appropriate status . currently , i agree that the situation for these two articles looks bad to wikipedia readers . however it could be remedied for now by reducing the unsupported statements in the village article and editing it to coordinate with the hd article . : i do n't currently know whether southport village vs . southport hd overlap is substantial enough to merit merger eventually . i do stand by the wikipedia - notability of the hd article that i created , and assert it was an advance for wikipedia for me to create it separately from the southport village article at its then - current state . the southport article then suggested , apparently incorrectly , by its inclusion of a misleading map , that it was a much larger area . at this point , i object to merging the hd article in without better information on the overlap , in part because the merger would invalidate some structure that i created . yes , merely the disambiguation page which indeed could be revised . the disambiguation page is technically \" out of whack \" if it points to [ wiki link : southport historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] , if there is not article at that name . i do n't want to over state that reason , i am just explaining it as one part of supporting structure which needs to be addressed when articles are moved to names not expected by the initially - nris - database - based naming system for nrhp places . i appreciate , dude man fel lab ra , that you at least asked about this contributing point . thanks ! : the official historic district is roughly the portion south of the railroad tracks ( the mixed zoning area of the neighborhood ) . in all cases where a historic district has the same name as a village neighborhood , you will find that the historic district is wholly contained in the village neighborhood . also , what edits to the southport article that i reverted were you talking about ? if it is the case that i did remove correct information , i will restore it . : thanks for commenting . by your statement about the location of the historic district , do you mean anything more than the location description text \" roughly bounded by southport harbor , rr , old south rd . and rose hill rd . \" from the nris database ? if you have different information that about the hd , and about the village neighborhood , i hope that you would share it . i must disagree with your unqualified statement that \" in all cases . you will find that the historic district is wholly contained in the village neighborhood . \" that is too much of an over - generalization . : about what edits did you revert , those would be your repeated edits that redirected the article to the southport article . i am not finding it amusing that here and in other comments on this page you are playing with words to imply you have not been edit warring to delete separate articles about ct nrhp hds that i have created . : the actual southport historic district is triangular and is somewhat smaller than the listed description text . you said you \" contributed to the village article \" and that i \" reverted some of your edits \" . what is this referring to ? about edit warring , i believe you are too . : at this point , i do n't really care very much , but how do you know that about the triangular district . it is almost irrelevant that you \" know \" that , if you will not provide sources and show it for others to see . : in the southport talk page and its article , as you are fully aware , i discussed and took steps to replace a misleading map that was in the article . i am not checking now , but for the moment i believe that the replacement map which i added is still in the article . that would be the part not reverted . also , as you are fully aware , i edited the southport article to wikilink to the separate southport historic district article , and to remove the duplicative nrhp infobox which you had copied in from the separate southport hd article , and perhaps in other small ways i edited to make the southport article complementary to the separate hd article . those would be the contributing edits of mine that you reverted . i did not repeat those edits , i stated here that i was not doing that . : i replaced the map with a more accurate one based on the census tract boundary ( seems to be good enough at small scale ) . as for the other edits , that presupposes a separate article . with regard to the triangular shape of the district , that 's what the vertices of the polygon defining the district look like ( with the caveat that i may be ignoring some minor corrections in the utm to lat - long conversion ) . see the section somewhere above for more details . do you really believe that part of the historic district is outside the area commonly known as southport ? : fine , that establishes you have reverted all , not just some , of my edits there . i do n't know what to believe , honestly . i know the policy of wikipedia is to value sourced statements above unsourced ones , and i see no sources or evidence other than polaron 's say - so , that the district is within or the same as the village , which as far as i can tell has no available definition anywhere . : i 've restored the southport hd article again , although with revision to drop the sentence , which i admit was awkward , attempting to characterize a relationship between the hd and the village . so , the current article is factual and entirely sourced . i suggest it be kept as is , unless and until someone does the work of getting the nrhp application document or other sources and adding sourced statements that describe the relationship of the hd and the village . question about edit warring and process what am i to do , with respect to polaron 's continued edit warring on the southport historic district and other articles ? i see now that he has again today reverted the southport hd article to redirect to the southport ( fairfield ) article . i have opened discussion here and invited others to comment , towards reaching a consensus decision . polaron initially redirected ( i think after i had already opened discussion here ) in [ external link : this first redirect ] , then repeated [ external link : in this diff ] , then [ external link : repeated today ] . since the topic is under discussion , i am experiencing this as [ wiki link : wp : disruptive ] . could an administrator comment about process here , please ? and , i am going to restore the hd article now . it undermines the discussion here to lose the article and i am personally experiencing polaron 's repeated edits as his trying to win an argument by edit warring , rather than developing and putting forward information towards creating a consensus . : i hit the rollback button , newly available to me , to implement that reversion . since i opened and continue in this discussion , i think that is okay , but if it was technically incorrect for me to use that button here then i apologize , and i would simply appreciate advice . : also glancing at polaron 's contributions i see just now that he has also [ external link : today edited ] to create [ wiki link : southport historic district ( connecticut ) ] as a competing similar name to redirect to his preferred target , trying to bypass the [ wiki link : southport historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] article ! i think this is disruptive and unhelpful ! : i see also that polaron has overridden , again , the [ wiki link : georgetown historic district ( georgetown , connecticut ) ] article , to redirect to his preferred target , by [ external link : this edit today ] . that in fact struck out the merger proposal request for discussion that had directed to here , properly . polaron 's previous edits to wipe out this article , all after discussion was clearly opened here , are [ external link : this reversion ] , and [ external link : this reversion ] . i am undoing polaron 's latest edit to wipe this out , now . there really should be a process for enforceable merges similar to afd . unless you somehow find content that applies to the historic district but not to the village , you have no basis for having two separate articles on the same thing . you can tell a better story by discussing the historic district in the village articles . you may have a better leg to stand on with respect to merging to the whole town article . but your inexplicable refusal to discuss the historic district in a village article is also disruptive . oh , and use of rollback to edit war is a definite no - no . : the process should be to discuss these ct nrhp cases here , to involve and get other editors ' consensus . and , unfortunately , to supplement that by requesting administrator intervention to stop your edit warring . i am discussing these issues in each case here and have not ruled out any topic for discussion . in the [ wiki link : southport historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] and other cases where i am drawing the line and reverting your deletions , i had created these articles , and you are one step ahead in any count of reversions . in the context of my opening discussion here , and seeking input from other editors , that is just preposterous to assert , as you have on this page and elsewhere , that we are somehow equally at fault in edit warring . what on earth can you mean that my \" inexplicable refusal \" to discuss anything is disruptive ? i am here and seeking discussion on the content matters , although distracted by the edit warring you are engaging in . : that separate historic district article was an embarrassment ( particularly \" the district may include some or all of the historic center of the village of southport , within fairfield \" ) . i restored polaron 's redirect . and polaron is correct , doncram use of rollback in an edit war is a definite \" no - no . \" it 's only supposed to be used for reverting vandalism . : re the statement ' the process should be to discuss these ct nrhp cases here , to involve and get other editors ' consensus , \" i 'd edit that to say that discussion should occur ( somewhere ) . it 's not obvious that talk pages for national register of historic places listings articles are the only place where articles about historic villages can be discussed . : and , yes , both of you are engaged in an edit war ( please cease and desist , or you will find yourselves sanctioned ) , but it should be noted that belligerent statements on a talk page do not exactly promote \" discussion to reach consensus . \" : in advance of opening the discussion here , i consulted with polaron at his talk page , in , about where to hold a central discussion about the multiple , similar situations all involving nrhp listings in ct . i interpreted polaron talking about \" there really should be a process for enforceable merges similar to afd \" as perhaps suggesting he was saying this is not the appropriate place for discussion and or that he would not abide by discussion here . orlady , i hope you are not suggesting that this should be moved somewhere else , or that this is not a fair place to discuss these issues . thanks also for noting that there has been edit warring , i guess , though i think you or anyone else could do better by noting some differential in behavior . also , i do n't appreciate your calling my work an embarrassment . i do n't want to start an escalating insult war with you , too . but i certainly could likewise say the previous southport article was an embarrassment , and my taking action to create an hd article was , at the first step , the best thing that could be done given nris information available plus what was in the southport article . i was not in a position to know about overlap between the village and hd , and there still is no adequate sourcing for the statements about overlap in the southport article . the significantly belligerent actions have been polaron 's overriding , presumptuous edits , in general giving no sources . even if he is knowledgeable about connecticut , the behavior is rude . in this separate discussion section about process , i think it is fair to call it that . georgetown historic district i note that the topic of some previous discussion , [ wiki link : georgetown historic district ( georgetown , connecticut ) ] has been revisited . a short while ago , polaron replaced the article there by redirect to merge it into [ wiki link : georgetown , connecticut ] . i just reverted it to restore the separate article . i believe reasons , including the ones about keeping the disambiguation page system in order , all apply for this case as well . polaron , please discuss and seek consensus which will involve other editors . it is not necessary for you to try to get your way by repeated edits in a low - grade edit war . anyhow , for here , what are the merits you see in eliminating this article ? : same issue as southport . nrhp town name issues has made many changes of locations in ct list - articles , including : * various town names in fairfield county nrhp list - article , changed in [ external link : this diff ] * various town names in hartford county nrhp list - article , changed in [ external link : this diff ] * various town names in li tch field county nrhp list - article , changed in [ external link : this diff ] * various town names in middlesex county nrhp list - article , changed in [ external link : this diff ] * one town names in new haven county nrhp list - article , changed in [ external link : this edit ] * various town names in new london county nrhp list - article , changed in [ external link : this diff ] * various town names in tol land county nrhp list - article , changed in [ external link : this diff ] * various town names in wind ham county nrhp list - article , changed in [ external link : this diff ] * possibly other changes within these county articles not captured in these single edit diffs * various other changes in which an nrhp row has been moved from one nrhp list - article to another * possibly hamlet location name changes within new haven city , hartford city , and bridgeport city articles . * others\n",

      "i 'll respond to several things you wrote and then offer some conclusions : ah , but here you are modifying whose intent matters . * no , i 'm not . maybe we both misunderstood each other . at any rate , this is getting way too involved . sometimes i have to remind myself : it 's only wikipedia . no viewer of a wikipedia article sees \" intent \" . viewers only see the effect of an article 's content * oh , i do n't know . the un washed masses are one thing , but i rather like to think that quite a few viewers * do n't take article content at face value . when i read something be it in a book , magazine , journal , encyclopedia or whatever i tend to consider the author ( s ) , editors , and the medium . surely i 'm not the only one who does that . now i 'm trying to imagine myself never having heard of the pioneer plaque and arriving at the human article for the first time . assuming i 'm human and not extraterrestrial , i will damn well already know what humans look like . in fact , i can not begin to imagine not knowing at least the ru di ments of male and female human anatomy . ( the only way i would n't is if i 'm very young , in which case the lead image of [ wiki link : human ] is going to be the least of my web - surfing worries , or part of an extremely insular society , in which case ditto . ) so what will i think ? i 'll think , hmm . line drawing of man and woman . maybe i 'll read the caption , follow the link to [ wiki link : pioneer plaque ] , maybe not . but i 'm not going to think , gosh , women have no external sex organs . neither will i think , oh , good , they censored the woman . in other words , i wo n't be misled by the image and i wo n't have some weird han gu p about depictions of nude women reinforced by the image . so what is the effect on me ? zil ch ( except possibly some vague , gut - reaction cool , that image has left the solar system thoughts ) . : * is that we 're calling them now ? viewers ? that sounds so z om bie like . tv has viewers . encyclopedias have readers , or at least they should . maybe , to be more inclusive of text , images , and audio content , we ought to call them users . only human biology and anthropology can be said to have \" human \" as a whole as their field of study . that does n't make other fields irrelevant , by any stretch of the imagination but they 're secondary * i do n't quite agree with you there . maybe it depends on what you mean by \" as a whole \" , but biology probably has less to say about the mind than psychology does about the body . also , calling the other fields \" secondary \" makes sense only if you see this article as just another taxonomy - based species article . i do n't think it is that ; it is unique in ways that no other article could be unique . but we discussed that point before . enough . i think there used to be such an article [ biology of humans ] * huh . if you get the chance at some point , maybe you could poke around . if it got deleted for some reason , it would be worth knowing whether there was anything salvageable . as a recreational activity , i agree . being a lay - philosopher , i am quite fond myself of speculating about human nature and the sort . but i draw a hard , strict line between such speculation and our editorial duties , which should never involve original - research speculation , least of all on such complex and in soluble ri dd les and i believe wikipedia policy backs me up on that matter . * you missed my point , i think . by suggesting we ask \" impractical , probably un answerable questions \" such as \" what is the essence of humanity with all its flaws \" , i was n't suggesting letting that get in the way of editorial duties . i meant that such questions or musings are a valid starting point , and that if we es chew that abstract territory and skip directly to the nuts and bolts of content , then we risk missing the larger picture . i 'm sure you 've run across wp articles that are me tho dically structured , thorough in their coverage of the topic , scrupulously neutral , free of or , amply sourced and utterly dry and boring . [ wiki link : human ] does n't particularly offend in that regard , although it perhaps could be a tri f le more colorful in places . we 're not machines writing about ourselves , we 're animals who happen to be the only animals capable of writing about themselves . the larger context of this article is that it 's the only article whose readers are all reading about themselves . those are special circumstances which might just merit a bit of flexibility in applying certain [ wiki link : wikipedia : list of policies content policies ] . one might even entertain the thought that such an extraordinary article merits the application of that most exceptional of policies : [ wiki link : wp : iar iar ] . many of our readers come from cultures with strictly sexist and misogynistic traditions and t abo os , and even if we do n't combat such issues ( which ruin very real , very human lives around the world ) at every turn , we should not \" perpetuate \" them in an article that is about humanity in general , not just about censorship or traditionally patriarchal cultures . * this is one of most compelling points you have made to date , imo , and i largely agree with you . the traditions and t abo os you refer to are worthy of further consideration with regard to this image and this article , and i for one would be very interested in learning more about them . however , the per pe tu ation you describe could be ame li or ated significantly in at least two ways : by ( ) including an additional image , anatomically acurate , elsewhere in the article and ( ) cap tioning the pioneer image with wording that acknowledges its inaccuracy . also , you 've made the claim without making the case that perpetuating the traditions and t abo os in this context is likely to contribute ap pre ci ably to the ruin of any human lives . and even if it did , might not the selection of a photographic image have a similar effect by omitting , instead of a body part , entire categories of humans ? we could simply be trading in one form of damage for another . i also consider it a bit of an ethical issue to familiarize male viewers to some slight degree with female anatomy . * pardon my bl un tness , but i consider that to be an utterly bogus argument . what male viewers are you thinking of ? [ wiki link : human ] does n't exist in a vacuum : anyone who can find it can find other articles with anatomically correct images . what clueless male who is looking to familiarize himself with female anatomy is going to seek out the human article , anyway ? speaking of \" throw [ ing ] everything against the wall and see [ ing ] what sticks \" ! if you 're going to include an argument like this , then i 'd suggest you need to illustrate it with a plausible scenario or two . i have been wrestling with this issue for several weeks now , and i consider it the most difficult conundrum i 've encountered to date at wikipedia . you make a number of eloquent arguments for replacing the image . while i am especially impressed ( and partially convinced ) by two of them , i do not fully accept the respective premises on which they 're based . the first of those two arguments was that [ wiki link : human ] is primarily a biology article . if i agreed with you there , i 'd say the pioneer plaque was clearly inappropriate for the lede image . as it happens , i do n't agree ( and probably can not be persuaded ) , although after much reflection i have concluded that biology is , and certainly should remain , one of the main thru sts of the article . ( this was where i sid led up to the fence you supposed i was str add ling . ) the second argument is that wikipedia could do potential damage to living humans by perpetuating the deliberate omission of the plaque creators . i have responded to that in some detail five paragraphs up , and while i think it 's a highly questionable argument , it 's also intriguing and troubling enough to merit further thought . ( that is not an invitation to send a tsunami of words my way . please distill . ) i still am not str add ling the fence , precisely , but i am leaning over it and gazing at the grass on the other side . frankly , your approach of employing such a large number of in tri c ately detailed arguments is n't helping your case , i think . picking out what you think are the two or three most important arguments and then summarizing them very succinctly would probably be more effective , whereas i 'd imagine that quite a few people are put off by the sheer volume of what you have to say . my guess is that a number of editors coming to the talk page through rfc channels have seen all that text and decided they really do n't want to comb through it in search of enlightenment . speaking only for myself , you have given me so much to think about that it has been difficult for me even to determine what the pivotal questions are , let alone to focus on them to the exclusion of the myriad details in the periphery . while i 've enjoyed our lengthy discussion , it has taken me longer to arrive at any meaningful conclusions than it would have if brevity had been the watch word . it 's your style to be wordy * , and that 's fine , but it is n't serving your purpose very effectively in this instance . : * if you had n't noticed i occasionally suffer from the same mal ady , the evidence is before you now . the reason that i offer this ( unsolicited ) advice is that i have decided to drop my opposition to doing a trial run of a different image . i want to emphasize that my definition of a trial run is markedly different from yours . to me , in this context , try means to give it a fair shot and see what happens , with the option of returning to the status quo ante if it does n't work out . in my opinion , failure would include either of the following : multiple instances of edit warring involving established editors ( this would include wheel warring ) or a clear majority of established editors indicating their disapproval on the talk page of the replacement image . ( i would argue that such a failure should n't shut the door on it permanently , btw . history is full of examples of worthwhile changes that came about after innumerable attempts . ) for the record , let me stress that i do not favor changing the image ; i simply no longer oppose trying a different one . i appreciate your sustained civility , and i hope you can accept that those of us who do n't see this quite as you do are not only entitled to our opinions but also to our own interpretations of wp policies . over the next few days , i will try to summarize my thinking and post something along these lines at talk : human . wrap - up section - break you 're quite right to say that i should be less long - winded ; if i were a s av vier deb ater and r he tor ician , i 'd certainly be more concise . we are , after all , creatures of emotion , and long , involved arguments often have much less effect than sn appy ph r as ings ! ) indeed , the desire to summarize my arguments is exactly the reason i made [ wiki link : talk : human image ] back in ' ( and expanded it in ' ) , so i could just direct people to all the relevant points there . but the work i and others put into that page ( including the policies i cited ) has been repeatedly dismissed as ' just one editor 's opinion ' , so i 've been forced to make new arguments . i 'll try to keep your good advice in mind ; my new attempt at conciseness will , i think , be [ wiki link : talk : human fa q draft ] ; if you see any major points missing there , or note any excess verbosity , feel free to comment on or revise it ! ) since it sounds like we basically agree ( or at least agree to disagree ) on all the major points here , feel free to pick and choose which , if any , of my below comments you wish to read and respond to . and thanks for all the food for thought ! i rather like to think that quite a few viewers * do n't take article content at face value . * perhaps so , but the face value and subtext are both parts of the \" effect \" . to clarify : the apparent intention ( what it seems to readers like wikipedia intends ) is part of your effect , but the intention you actually have is not . so a completely non - racist , non - sexist editor can still make edits that are utterly racist or sexist , entirely by accident . the state of mind of the editor is immaterial and irrelevant , because average viewers will perceive a given edit the same way whether it was originally made by hitler or by gandhi . i can not begin to imagine not knowing at least the ru di ments of male and female human anatomy . * if by \" the ru di ments \" , you mean stuff like \" they have fingers per hand , two eyes , etc . \" , then i agree . but if by \" the ru di ments \" you mean \" the exact appearance of the [ wiki link : vulva ] , [ wiki link : pubic hair ] , etc . \" , then you 'd be surprised . not all human beings in the world are required to take sex education classes and even the minority of humans privileged enough to live in a country where such courses are required , are not all old enough to have already become so fam i li arized . but i 'm not going to think , gosh , women have no external sex organs . neither will i think , oh , good , they censored the woman . ' * nor did i ever suggest that you would . most ' thoughts ' people have are not conscious , nor are they formatted as sentences or propositions . rather , they take the form of vague feelings and habits of perception - response . no one will think the exact sentence \" gosh , women have no external sex organs \" , but the fairly young and the fairly insular ( who are not such r ar ae aves in ter r is as you might think ) will be left at least as ignorant as they were before visiting the page , if not more ignorant and that is the opposite of wikipedia 's job , reinforcing or preserving even subtle lac un ae of knowledge . nor will anyone think \" oh , good , they censored the woman \" , but many of them will have a slightly more positive emotional reaction to the image than they would have had if the vulva were visible taboo information is not consciously reinforced by members of a society ; it is reinforced without any conscious effort on the individual 's part , simply by people being satisfied and content with censorship of the taboo , and being at least slightly averse , on the level of emotion , to visual depictions of the taboo object . for members of societies with such a taboo , every incidence of a nude woman with the vulva erased reinforces the taboo , and every incidence of one with the vulva uncensored violates the taboo , if only unconsciously . * what makes this a clear - cut matter for wikipedia is the fact that we have no policy suggesting that we pri ori ti ze taboo - adherence over accurate informational content . whether we subjectively consider the issue in question major or minor is beside the point and determining how ' major ' it is is a needless violation of npov in any case . what could be more po ved than justifying the censorship of a primary female sex characteristic on the grounds that it 's not anatomically important ? such justifications merely dig the hole deeper ( especially when we 're simultaneously implicitly saying that the primary sex characteristics of the male are crucially important ) . why is it wikipedia 's job to weigh in on its importance to begin with ? is that we 're calling them now ? viewers ? that sounds so z om bie like . * sh rug ge th . since we 're discussing a picture , not text , it seemed appropriate . and ' user ' suggests ' editor ' , to me . thorough in their coverage of the topic , scrupulously neutral , free of or , amply sourced and utterly dry and boring . ' * in general , i agree . and once the plaque issue is moving , i plan to put a lot of effort into trying to spruce up the rest of the article . however , i 'd make one point : when an editorial decision is particularly controversial and emotionally laden , sometimes a relatively \" dry and boring \" choice is the very best one , simply because it is least likely to confuse and conf ound readers or editors . but obviously we ca n't go too far down that road , and a better way to get at what i 'm suggesting is that a straightforward feature is sometimes a better approach than getting too ' fancy ' . * ( also , in this case [ wiki link : wikipedia : ignore all rules iar ] fortunately does n't apply , because improving the encyclopedia and following the rules converge on one solution with regard to the plaque . ) ( ) including an additional image , anatomically acurate , elsewhere in the article and ( ) cap tioning the pioneer image with wording that acknowledges its inaccuracy . * both of those options would be improvements i 'd support . but the elegant concise utility of just replacing the plaque with an accurate anatomy photo ( either directly , by putting it in the lead , or indirectly , by putting it under ' biology ' and finding a brand - new photo for the lead ) kills two birds with one stone . trying to compensate for the plaque 's censorship raises the risk of clutter or over compensation , and is more likely to continuously lead to editorial debates in the long run than simply replacing it . even if it did , might not the selection of a photographic image have a similar effect by omitting , instead of a body part , entire categories of humans ? * any image which is clearly intended to sym bo li ze humanity will inevitably have that effect . the current plaque both omits body parts and omits entire categories of humans just look at how many times people have complained about the \" caucasian \" appearance of the image . so at the very least a photo replacement would eliminate one of the two current problems . but in all honestly i do n't really see how showing people a picture of an [ wiki link : ak ha ] tribe sman could perpetuate any avoidable oppressive social structures . ( and if nothing else , it avoids the appearance effect of bias as much as any image could , since i do n't think many people will infer from the image that wikipedia is run by an ak ha cabal . ) a cabal biased toward america and the west , on the other hand . hmm . ) human does n't exist in a vacuum : anyone who can find it can find other articles with anatomically correct images . * first of all , most people who do n't already know about female anatomy would n't know where to start looking ; the ' very young ' and ' very insular ' you mentioned are the least likely people to know terms like [ wiki link : vulva ] . however , that is n't really what i had in mind , since there are plenty of other ways they could quickly find that information . instead , the reason i consider this a real issue , at least for some of our readership , is because from what i 've seen most wikipedia visitors are not wikipedia addicts like us . ) they 're random people who might have just done a google search and clicked on the first page they saw . most of them only visit or articles on wikipedia , before closing out ; some , obviously , play the fun game of ' degrees of wikilinks ' , but i 'd be quite surprised if a supermajority did . ( besides which , as a matter of policy , every article is ideally supposed to be able to stand alone ; other articles should be supplements at best . ) the first of those two arguments was that human is primarily a biology article . * i do n't want to get into a tangent here , but i 'd note that one interesting perspective on the relationship between biology and culture is that culture is a biological subject one could consider ' psychology ' , ' sociology ' , etc . to be sub fields of biology ( analogous to [ wiki link : e tho logy ] ) in the sense that only biological entities can be studied by such means , and only as a consequence of biological features they possess ( e . g . , a large brain ) . however , i would not make that argument myself here , since i do n't think it 's the common understanding of the relationship between biology and the social sciences . * besides which , i do n't think it actually matters whether [ wiki link : human ] is ' mostly biology ' or ' mostly sociology ' or what - have - you ; even if [ wiki link : human ] were only biological , we should still pick an image like ak ha which reflects human biology and culture , and not just pick an image that totally disregards human biology . ( or , much worse , misrepresents it . ) give it a fair shot and see what happens , with the option of returning to the status quo ante if it does n't work out . * barring a truly apocalyptic catastrophe , i do n't think this is a valid option . no matter how much blow back an alternative image receives , it wo n't change [ wiki link : wp : not wikipedia 's censorship policies ] . if it turns out after the switch that the ak ha image violates policy in some un foreseen way ( or possibly if it 's just viciously ' controversial , for at least one substantive reason ) , i have two recommendations : either ( ) switch to a second , backup alternative ( perhaps a photo , perhaps an anatomy drawing ? ) , or ( ) simply remove the image and make our taxobox image - free for a bit . obviously would be a temporary measure , but it might settle down tensions temporarily if we need to take some time to discuss new arguments or options . and i slightly like the idea of ( even though i prefer , or reverting to the ak ha image as the first proposed alternative which does n't violate any policies ) because it does n't give the illusion that the issue is ' settled ' , and thus encourages productive debate . * i do n't have any particular attachment to any image , but i do think that we should treat the plaque on a level playing field with other image candidates , and not privilege it merely because it happens to have been on the article in the past . in any case , i greatly appreciate your comments and your willingness to compromise , despite my failures to be clear or concise at various points . although we do n't see eye - to - eye , i consider that an advantage anyone who agrees too much with me ca n't be of much help when i get things wrong . ) i hope your voice of moderation will be of help when we give the switch - over a try , and i hope we can work together on more important matters of improving the article 's contents in the future\n",

      "race . ethnic groups . successive myanmar military leaders repeatedly claim that muslims in myanmar ( burma ) could not be called , registered or enlisted as a separate race . they are giving various reasons or lame excuses for that attempts of ethnic cleansing . ( i hope wikipedia could stay neutral and resist on this issue of the at temps by some of its own burmese chauvinist editors to erase my [ wiki link : burmese muslims ] [ wiki link : myanmar muslims ] and [ wiki link : burmese indian muslims ] [ wiki link : myanmar indian muslims ] . muslims in myanmar ( burma ) are mix - blooded people , not pure race as burmese buddhists . muslims are migrants only and not the original people of the land . muslims are scattered all over the country without owning a separate state as other races of burma . no race can be formed base on the religion . by calling kala , meaning indian , the authorities equate all the muslims with the recent migrants of indians under the british or even trying to accuse as fresh illegal immigrant . the hidden agenda is their deep - seated fear of propagation of islam . they are scared of future muslim dominance although it is not possible . we hereby intend to consider some undeniable facts about the three crucial words of now let us look at the \" roots of myanmar muslims . \" forefathers of myanmar muslims had landed in myanmar ( burma 's ra khine , ay ey ar w ady delta and tan in th ary i coast ) as early as ninth century , roughly about years before king an aw ra hta of pagan established the first myanmar ( burmese ) empire in ad . he later concurred the king manu ha and buddhist mons of that on . he then invited shin ar ahan to propagate buddhist teaching among people of pagan . so the buddhist religion reached burma much later than the arrival of islam . but we had to admit that the hindus and buddhists arrived the lower burma ( not owned by the burmese or myanmar yet ) earlier than the islam . because of that uniting force of buddhist religion , the original three ethnic minority groups of pagan : py u , kan yan and thet assimilated homo gene ously into present my an mars . so , we hereby want to challenge present myanmar generals , especially b spp s lor c spdc and cohorts burmese cha u vin ists to deny that the buddhist religion forms the backbone of the formation of bur mans or my an mars . even the chinese , indian hindus , indian muslims , japanese and some anglo bur mans if they convert ( or pretend to convert to ) buddhism they would be homo gene ously assimilated into burmese buddhists . [ wiki link : burmese chinese ] like general ne win , general kh in ny unt , president san yu etc are accepted as \" pure burmese \" and given high test positions . when shia muslim u sein win and sunni dr ma ung di renounced islam , they were accepted into the mainstream administration , sein was even given pm post . mg di deputy ed . minister . there are many mixed blooded people in myanmar disguised as pure bam as . during the spdc 's present registration on issuing national identity cards , if any said he or she is buddhist no more questions , easily accepted as pure b ama . but one the rel ag ion is islam , even if he or se is recently converted into islam , they refused to accept as a pure race . it is not a simple , minor issue but the very important thing of denying a citizen 's right to pose ss a national identity card . without it could not travel inside or outside myanmar burma . race . ethnic minority group and , . citizen . we should analyze which groups of people are deserved to be called or who have the sole right to be called a separate race , separate distinct ethnic minority group or a real citizen . are only so called \" pure race \" should be called a race and not so pure or mixed blooded people could not stay together to form a race ? . or are those \" pure blooded \" races are really pure enough ? . are those \" original owners of the land \" really true or just mere early migrants , re serving and mono poli zing the place ? . are migrants always regarded as migrants without entitlement to any human rights or citizens ' rights , even after few generations ? . well - established migrants , after already accepted as a citizen are still foreigners ? . are descendents of migrants and local mixed marriages still alien after few generations ? . could a conqueror of the war just annex es the new territory and regarded the locals staying in that land as foreigners and started the ethnic cleansing ? . could that conqueror brought back the prisoners of war back , for various reasons e . g . slavery , to serve in various positions , civil or army , and allowed to settle in the heart of the country as permanent aliens for few generations ? . could the kings , after accepting the helping friendly allied forces , allow them to settle in his country , gave land , property and even brides as rewards after the victory , but a few generations later kicked them out as lousy migrants ? . after staying few dozens of years or few centuries under a foreign powers as a colony , once got the independence , could the new local government start to kick out the migrants entered during the period of colony ? . could they erase the real historical fact of gaining their independence after all was obtained with the help of so - called migrants ? . should they neglect the promises of fair and equal treatment they had given to those migrants and the colonial masters before gaining the independence ? . is a religion could never form the backbone of a race ? . is descendents of migrants could never form a separate or distinct race ? . is a religion could never form the backbone of an ethnic minority group ? . is descendents of migrants could never form an ethnic minority group ? . to be regarded as a race , ethnic minority group or a citizen , is there any rule to be the original settler or owner of a land ? country ? or a state ? . have the migrants no chance to be accepted as citizens ? although all of the above questions lead to undeniable truth , we like to highlight the above axioms with the following facts . they are taken from the world 's historical theatre and our myanmar ( burmese ) geography and local history . race . a group of people with a certain sense of itself and co he si veness is called a race . there is usually a commonality or shared values such as : social , culture , attitudes and ideals . the most important bond and determining all these is a religion . there is usually a common language , literature and a territory . it may be a pure ' race ( homogeneous ) e . g . arian , mongoloid or african . or a mixed ' race ( heterogeneous ) that is a mixture of few tribes , clans or minority groups . they mixed , stayed and struggled together with the sense of unity . let us look at how islam deals with this sensitive racial issue as arabs were and are so proud of their race . islam not only recognises absolute equality between men irrespective of any distinction of colour , race or nationality , but also makes it an important and significant principle , a reality . all human are descendants of one father and one mother . the division of the human race is neither meant for one nation to take pride in its superiority over others nor is it meant for one nation to treat another with contempt or disgrace , or regard them as a mean and degrade other races and usurp their rights . south africa zulu is the combination of many tribes and clans by a powerful wor rier in nineteenth century . so it is obvious that they are not homogeneous . african americans & asian americans are regarded as recognized ethnic minority groups but there are many subgroups under them . among asian americans , some of the bigger groups such as indian americans and chinese americans could be subdivided according to the clan , dialect , religion and their home state or district . so it is very obvious that non - homogeneous or more correctly , heterogeneous factor could not rule out the legality of a race . owning a territory , land , state or country is not very important to become a race . israelis and palestinians have no homeland at all earlier in the long world history . actually they were not the original owners of that sacred land . just because they had no land , we could not deny the fact that , the israelis and palestinians distinct and famous races . they were even mentioned in three holy books and their racial conflict was and is the world 's most important and dangerous problems . most of the american ethnic groups also have no separate states . or some ethnic groups ' historical territories may be occupied by different nations or countries at present . we like to give some examples . mons of myanmar , thailand cambodia , now occupied by three separate countries . like some of the myanmar ethnic groups , the mal ays , in done sians and polynesians had descended from the y un an but few historians are thinking about the possibility of reverse migration from australia side . but some polynesians have got some mixture of africa . but even recently some genetic experts found out that there is some evidence that the chinese originally descended and migrated from africa . actually the \" bush people \" featured in god is crazy ' are a little bit yellow and their features are some what like myanmar or mongoloid . ( one of the myanmar doctor , an aesthetic in nama bia wrote in the myanmar magazine in ) . ka rens of myanmar and thailand . sh ans , si am and southern chinese ( nan khan ) divided into the races of myanmar , thailand , laos and some chinese ethnic minorities . nag as of myanmar and india are exactly same races in different countries . and many ethnic minority groups commonly found in china and india are also found and recognised as pri ded or precious nationals of myanmar especially in k ach in and shan states . so the relation of the citizenship for the same race staying in different country is totally different . relation between the race and history of land ownership is also irrelevant . the preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : sign your posts on talk pages unsigned ] comment was added by . and the population of the myanmar muslims increased during the british rule of burma because of new waves of indian muslim immigration . this sharply reduced since because of indo - bur man immigration agreement , and totally stopped after burma ( myanmar ) gained independence in jan . so myanmar muslims are at least staying in myanmar from years and some of them are staying for more than years already . myanmar muslims are descendants of arabs , persians , turks , moo res , indian - muslims , pakistanis , pathans , b eng alis , chinese muslims and mal ays inter married with local burmese and many ethnic myanmar groups such as : ra khine , shan , karen , mon etc . muslims arrived burma as travellers , ad ven turers , pioneers , sailors , military person als ( voluntary and mercenary ) , and some of them as prisoners of wars . some take refuge ( from wars , mon soon storms and weather , shipwreck and some for other various un foreseen circumstances ) . and some of them are victims of forced slavery . some of them are professionals and skilled person als such as advisors to the kings and at various ranks of administration . some are port - authorities and mayors and traditional medicine men . some of them are good at various vocational skills , culture arts etc . mixed marriages , inter marriages and assimilation process of throwing away of almost all their foreign languages , foreign dresses and foreign culture slowly shaped them in to ethnic myanmar muslim group of today . but they had drawn a line in the ongoing process of assimilation . that line of limit is their religion , islam . as practising muslims they could not go beyond the limit of tolerance of islamic principles . so myanmar muslims threw away urdu , bengali , chinese , hindi and all other foreign languages . even arabic is learned just to read holy koran and for prayers . myanmar muslims speaks myanmar as their mother tongue , wear myanmar dress and even have an official myanmar name as well as islamic arabic name . because they could not compromise their faith in islam in matters such as : only eating halal foods and drinks , marriage , divorce , inheritance , and other customs which heavily depend on islam e . g . circumcision , funeral and burial rituals etc . so myanmar muslims could not assimilate homo gene ously as chinese , hindus and others , except for those who convert or renounced islam . complete assimilation of a minority group always need a compromise of their tradition , their culture and some of their rights . ethnic minority based on religion . in myanmar ( burma ) , general ne win ordered not to allow the registration of the muslims as burmese muslims ( myanmar muslims ) and present military junta not only simply follow his tradition and laws but tightening their grips on burmese muslims . although the whole world accepts that the persons who worships islam are called muslims . ne win and present junta refused registration based on religion . they refused to allow the muslims of burma to be registered as myanmar muslims ( burmese muslims ) . they are forced to register as indian hybrid , pakistan hybrid , and bengali hybrid , worshipping islam . so in order to avoid been labelled or registered or discriminated as a foreigner or a lower graded citizens , a few of the myanmar muslims even enlisted or registered themselves as burmese - buddhists . actually the religion is the most important factor in the formation of the ethnic minority groups in the whole world . this is really the most explosive issue in most of the ethnic - conflicts , leading to wars around the world throughout the history . in former yugoslavia : serbs , croats kosovo and bosnia differences are mainly based on religion . in lebanon , christian and arabs are the two opposing ethnic groups . even among main religions , sometimes different sects fought each other e . g . sunni muslims and shia ' muslims , roman catholics and protestants of north ireland are fighting based on religious differences in their ethic groups . in sri lanka , buddhist and sinhalese are fighting . in indonesia the people from bali are different from other parts of indonesia because of the religion only . they remained buddhist without converting to islam . because of the religion , they could not assimilate totally with indonesian muslims . they maintained some of their customs and rituals . the main difference of indian and pakistan is religion . internal racial riots and cont in u os internal conflicts in these countries are based on religion . cyprus , germany , italy , spain uk and usa also have differences and voting - trends based on religious lines . ( no catholic could be elected president of usa for nearly years until j . f . kennedy became president in ) . ka rens in myanmar are also subdivided by religion . christian ka rens are more numerous and different from buddhist ka rens and muslim ka rens . they differ not only in religion and customs but their political alienation or alignment is totally different . ruling myanmar governments always look the christian ka rens with a suspect , because the christians are more close and loyal to ex - colonial masters . just after the independence of myanmar , mostly christian ka rens re be lled against the central government . and the myanmar army lost most of the country . christian ka rens even arrested a group of top ranked military officers including the deputy commander - in - chief of the myanmar army . buddhist ka rens betrayed and rescued them back . they were honoured with the highest awards in myanmar military 's history . presently also , we could see the same kind of alignment . buddhist ka rens deserted the fellow christian karen rebels . buddhist ka rens joined their hands with myanmar army and raided the christian - ka rens across the myanmar - thai border . apart from them , there also muslim ka rens in myanmar . some of them even formed the kaw tho ole muslim liberation force ( k ml f ) and formed alliance with the christian karen rebels . buddhist - rak hin es are also different from muslim rak hin es or ro hing yas . some of them are even active as a rebel group called , the ro hing ya patriotic front . pan th ays or chinese myanmar muslims are also totally different from other chinese or other myanmar chinese . buddhist shan and muslim sh ans are also quite different . so it is obvious that the new ethnic minority groups will appear depending upon their religion . the religions will become the main and very strong bonds in the formation of the various ethnic minority groups in burma myanmar . and the religion is the main obstacle obstructing the complete assimilation of the minority groups . in other words , religion sometimes prevents the disappearing of the ethnic - minority groups . daw aung san su ky i in her book \" the voice of hope \" told alan clements about the politics and religion : a journalist said to me , \" when you speak to the people you talk a lot about religion , why is that ? \" i said , \" because politics is about people , and you ca n't separate people from their spiritual values . \" and he said that he had asked a young student who had come to the weekend talks about this : \" why are they are talking about religion ? \" the student replied , \" well that 's politics . \" our people understand what we are talking about . some people might think it is either idealistic or naive to talk about me tta ' in terms of politics , but to me it makes a lot of practical good sense . ac : it 's a matter of debate , but politics and religion are usually segregated issues . in burma today , the large portion of monks and nuns see spiritual freedom and socio political freedom as separate areas . but in truth , d ham ma ( religion ) and politics are rooted in the same issue - freedom . d a s s k : indeed , but this is not unique to burma . everywhere you 'll find this drive to separate the secular from the spiritual . in other buddhist countries you 'll find the same thing - in thailand , sri lanka , in mahayana buddhist countries , in christian countries , almost everywhere in the world . i think some people find it embarrassing and impractical to think of the spiritual and political life as one . i do not see them as separate . in democracies there is always a drive to separate the spiritual from the secular , but it is not actually required to separate them . whereas in many dictatorships , you 'll find that there is an official policy to keep politics and religion apart , in case i suppose , it is used to upset the status quo . history and geography alone could not be the basic factors determining the legality of the official recognition of the ethic minority groups of a country . especially history is a very poor guide . there was almost always someone else there first . israelis and pal est ines almost always fight for their native ' homeland . actually neither of them were there first to occupy that land . just have a look at the history of myanmar . assam and man ip ure of india ; phi mor , gor lan and kan fan of china ( the names stated here are myanmar names ) ; ay uth ya of thailand ; penang of malaysia , were once under myanmar 's influence , even if it was for a brief period of time . and alternately , ar akan king nar am ei kh la founded the m ro ha ung or m ra uk - oo with the military help of nadir shah , the muslim sultan of bengal . so his heirs , the successive ar akan kings were subject to bengal from to ad . the buddhists of ar akan the other major ethnic community , known as mag h or ra khine are a mix - blooded race descended from aryans of mag ha da , india , mongo lians and ti be to - bur mans . hindus , portuguese , chinese , british and japanese partly or completely colon ise myanmar in history for various lengths of periods . and in ancient times , polynesians of pacific islands first occupied the ancient burma and were pushed down by ancient in done sians and mal ays . actually all those polynesians , in done sians , mal ays and most of the present myanmar and ethnic minorities descended or migrated from china through y un an . hindu colonists , of andhra dynasty , from middle india ( bc ) established han th aw addy ( actually mon town han saw adi similar to thailand citizen mons ) and sy ri am ( t any in or than ly in ) in burma . even before them , orissa , indian buddhist colonists , arrived there earlier , settled and built pag od as since bc . there was a well - known belief and people even used to say that myanmar started from t aga ung , built by abi raja , a sak ian ( tha ki win min ) , indian royal family member , migrated from k api la vat thu ( india ) after defeated by the king of pan ch ala ( india ) , vi tat upa . he left the middle country ( india ) and established the t aga ung country , known at that time as sang ass ar at tha or sang ass an agara . on the death of abi raja , younger son kan raja nge ( younger king kan ) got the throne . thirty - three kings reigned there . elder brother kan raja gy i ( elder king kan ) went down the ay ey ar wad dy river , ascended the thal law adi river , arrived kel at a un gn yo and ruled there as raj aga ha . he ruled the ancient ar akan . his son mu du ci tta became king of the py us ( ancestors of modern myanmar ) . he founded the city of ky au p pad aung . he conquered the dh ann av ati ( built by king mar ayu ) . so what is the great deal , dear buddhist burmese brothers ? the pure indian or kala brothers , kan rajas ( kan y az a gy i and nge ) were your ancestors . one started myanmar kingdom and another the ra khine kingdom . both of them were very fresh , recent and new immigrants . and your myanmar ( burmese ) and ra khine royal families descended from them . are all of you are not ashamed to call the muslims kal as and labelled as migrants , hybrids , non citizens , when all of you are actually totally same as us . and all of us know that all the major religions never started in burma . all of the religions are foreign to all of us . the mainland burmese are now able to colonize the ar akan state because , the british presented them , free of charge , as an extra gift during the granting of independence to burma . actually the burmese could colonize the ar akan state with their own strength for thirty - two years only from to ad . the ar ak ans ( buddhists and muslims ) agreed to join the burmese union because they had trusted all the promises given by general aung san , during the pang long treaty . if not , the british would not allow including the ar akan and other states to join the mainland burma . but general ne win and successive burmese generals betrayed the ethnic minorities and ignored the promises given by general aung san . although the minorities including ar ak ans had given up their rights to separate from the union , the burmese chauvinist military generals still refused to recognize their other rights e . g . religious , cultural , political and civil rights etc . muslims of the ar akan i . e . ro hing yas are suffering most . it is a little bit funny that in spite of long established history of muslim ro hing yas , the burmese colon ist generals , who could manage to colonized ar akan for a mere thirty - two years only , claims that they are the rightful owner of ar akan and the ro hing yas are alien migrants . if we continue back to the glorious burmese history : the invading chinese from the north destroyed t aga ung . the last king of t aga ung , b hin na ka raja run away and died later . his followers split in to three divisions . one division founded the nineteen shan states at the eastern part . another division moved down ay ey ar w ady river and combined with mu du ci tta ( second generation migrant , grand son of indian abi raja ) and other sa ki yan ( indian ) princes , among the py us , k any ans and the ks . the third group stayed in mali with the chief queen naga h sein , a sa ki yan . ( indian ) she was the queen of the sa ky i yan king d ha ja raja migrated from india . on the way he founded thin t we ' . then they founded the upper bag an ( pagan ) . da hn nav ata captured tham bula , queen of py us . but nan h kan ( china ) queen of py us had driven out the k any ans , who lived in seven hill - tracks beginning than t we ' . king dw att ab aung , direct descendent of abi raja ( indian migrant ) founded th are kh it taya in bc . it was said to be self - destroyed in ad . the history is half - mystical at that time . mons or tal a ings , an ethnic minority group of myanmar , migrated from the tal ing ana state , madras coast of southern india . they mixed with the new migrants of mongol from china and driven out the above andhra and orissa colonists . those mon ( tal a ings ) brought with them the culture , arts , literature , religion and all the skills of civilisation of present myanmar . they founded the that on and bago ( pe gu ) kingdoms . that mon mighty kingdom extended from lower burma ( pa the in or bas sein , maw lam y ine or mou l mein , tan in th ary i or ten asser im , t any in or sy ri am ) , thailand cambodia . king an aw ra hta of bag an ( pagan ) conquered that mon kingdom of king manu ha , named su v ann ab umi ( the land of golden hu es ) . two princes named tham ala and wi mala ( myanmar version of indian names - thal ma and vim ala . ) established the town bago in ad . tab in sh we hti ( ta un goo dynasty ) conquered it in ad . the arabs and european travellers of the ninth century saw many myanmar - muslim sailors and traders , in pe gu ( bago ) , also known as us sa . now there are only a few real mons ( much less than few hundred thousands ) in myanmar . but they were rewarded with the separate mon state by the general ne win 's government because of his strong second man , general tin oo ( actually he was even well known as one and a half ' i . e . higher than number two position , as he controlled the military intelligence ) . he was a mon . later he was accused of corruption and removed from the number two post . this was allegedly after the thailand 's official twenty - one gun salute and red carpet reception for his ( general tin oo ) son and daughter - in - law 's honey moon trip there . please allow me to interrupt with another interesting short story , which is not directly related with the main issue but because of a lot of coincidences . another general tin oo ( now n ld opposition leader ) was the chief commander or middle division military command . he was very popular among the grass root people , military rank and file and among the ruling elite . he had just rooted out the prolonged strong hold of burma communist party 's head - quarters on the bago yo ma ( pe gu mountain ranges ) . when we met , i was surprised because he recognised me although i was almost an ordinary person and we had only met briefly once before that . he greeted me and suddenly jo ked with me . he told me the story of ky an sit tha , during the war with the mon ( tal a ings ) went to pray the famous sh we maw daw pag oda in bago . when he came down the tal a ings ' had surrounded the pag oda , but ky an sit tha manage to come down without any harm . he asked me the reason and answer to this miracle ' . the answer is very easy , just a hom ophone only . ta , means one in burmese . ta - line means one line on the shoulder i . e . a rank and file in his own army . so , ky an sit tha was not surrounded by the enemy mons ( tal a ings ) but was just surrounded by his own military men , ta - lines ' . that general tin oo was later promoted to the chief commander of burma armed forces and became the number two man ' in burma . but that position was dangerous under the dictator ne win . once the second man became popular and if there were signs of a threat , he used to removed and replaced with a weaker person so that his number one position would be safe . general tin oo was accused of corruption . he had alleged to accept five bottles of liquor , accepted the government controlled foreign currency to buy medicine for his child suffering from le uk a emia . the burmese military attach in london allegedly gave that medicine to him . another reason for his removal was , his wife , a medical doctor was proud and rude among the military families ! portuguese , philip de bri to ( nga zin ga ) established a colony in sy ri am from to . chinese ku bla i khan 's muslim turkish soldiers , commanded by nas ru din , the son of y un an governor attacked and took over burma in ad . tar tars at first took strong hold in b ham o ( burma ) for a few years and later destroyed bag an ( pagan ) in ad . sh ans of myanmar and si ams , now known as th ais are from one same ethnic group . their language is different in slang only . they are descended from sino - shan and mon k ham ars , who came down from y un an , china . u nu , the last democratically elected prime minister of burma , overthrown by the general ne wins ' military coup , later formed the government - in - exile in thailand . after he returned ( surrendered ) to burma , there were praises in the government controlled media , regarding his patriotism in refusal to sign an alleged agreement to allow shan state to be annexed with thailand in exchange for the military and financial aids . myanmar language . myanmar muslims are using myanmar language as their mother tongue . they are well assimilated in this aspect . a lot of ethnic minority groups through out the world are facing problems because of the language differences . myanmar spoken language is under ti be to - bur man family . the source of the myanmar script ( written language ) was adopted from the brah mi script from india ( bc . to ad . ) , in the reign of king as oka . this brah mi indian sc ri p spread to tibet , sri lanka , myanmar , thailand , cambodia and even some parts of indonesia . in myanmar , this br ami script was developed and modified by the ci vi li sations of py u ( now disappeared and totally assimilated in myanmar ) , mon , ra khine , and myanmar . myanmar language script was fine tune again after introducing sanskrit , pali , py u and mon scripts . earliest myanmar written language starts in bag an ( pagan ) period of eleven century . when compare to many of the pri ded , recognised ethnic minorities , who could not speak myanmar language , most of the muslims in myanmar could speak the mother tongue . myanmar traditional dress . myanmar - muslims have adopted and taken the myanmar dress as their own . it is widely accepted that tai k p one ( myanmar man 's jacket ) was taken from china and the lon gy i ( sar ong ) was taken from india . curiously muslim religious customary pur dah , a veil for the women , is spread to even burmese - buddhists and other ethnic minorities . they called that with the adopted name pa wah . so the present ethnic groups all over the world , including the races of myanmar ( burma ) are not the original owners of the land . and are not neatly arranged into nations . there is a lot of spill over into neighbouring states . and their religion , language , culture and traditional dresses are usually found to be shared or modified from others . the author of this book wish to make clear that the above paragraph does not mean to insult or belittle the spirit and pride of nationality and the state of been a member of a particular ethnic group . i wished to reduce the fanatic extremist , nationalistic spirits only . after all , we all are just fellow , brothers and sisters staying temporary on earth . why should we fight the deadly wars and hate each other for the non - permanent properties and lands . peace , kindness , loving kindness , forgiveness , charity , helping the needy and various good virtues are the teachings of all our religions . so , based on the above , undeniable , concrete facts and truths no one should deny the rights of muslims in burma ( myanmar ) . myanmar muslims have a right to be recognized as one of the races in myanmar ( burma ) . we are one of the legal ethnic minority groups of myanmar ( burma ) . myanmar muslims ( burmese muslims ) are no more foreigners nor migrants but full - blown citizens of myanmar ( burma ) . muslims in myanmar ( burma ) have the same and equal rights with all other myanmar citizens , including burmese buddhists and all the ethnic minorities of burma ( myanmar ) . i hereby wish to refer an article written by me in the burma digest . ( you can confirm with the burma digest chief editor and publisher , dr tay za that i am the author and copy right owner and is allowed by burma digest to republish anywhere including wikipedia ) open letter to the editor : we are all burmese in our heart dear editor , i hope that you and some of the burmese digest readers could recalled my name in association with my best friend ko tin new ( bo aung din ) . he had mentioned a few times about me in his a dozen compassionate letters to nan . as he had mentioned , my grandfather was a burmese muslim and married to a pure burmese girl , ko tin n we 's grand aunt that is the sister of ko tin n we 's grandfather . as he had mentioned , she was disowned by her father because she married a so called a kala ' . actually the kala ' she married was the burmese muslim , the son of the royal body guard of ny aung yan prince . yes ! i am not blu ffing . his family was famous for the loyalty and bra veness and was descendents of afghanistan warriors at first came to burma as mercenaries . and they were already regarded as loyal subjects of the burmese kings or in other words burmese citizens . they are completely bur man ized except for their religion . they loved to be called burmese muslims and successive burmese kings had already recognized them as burmese muslims and as their loyal subjects citizens and even given them the relevant lands designated with their jobs . in old royal capital mand alay , we could still see the two a my au k tans ' meaning cannon or large artillery men 's quarters . my in win ' horse - men 's quarters , sin ky w one ' meaning elephant keepers , ko yan daw win ' meaning royal body guards ' quarters etc still fully occupied by their descendents burmese muslims with respectively named mosques . as ko tin n we wrote , oh bo mosque was donated by king min don , all the te ak pillars were meant for the royal palace but those that could not go into their respected holes in time according to the astrologers were discarded and donated to build the mosque . chinese muslim mosque 's land was also donated by king min don and he also donated the hostel in mecca for his burmese muslim subjects . mand alay was founded on monday , the rd may . but king mind n passed away on the st of october at the age of sixty - four . king thi ba w ( - ) took the throne illegally or by a palace coup . it was near the end of king mind n 's illness , which lasted about two months that , the ala - n and aw queen plotted the maneuver ings to make thi ba w prince to get the throne . she was the daughter of king bag yi daw ( - ) , by his chief queen . she became very powerful after the death of the chief queen nan mad aw pay a in november . the rightful heir - apparent , the kan aung prince was murdered in the rebellion of . king mind n was undecided and he si tated to choose a new successor but put three of the best trusted and elderly princes as regents viz : me kk hara , the th nz and the ny aung yan princes . al - n and aw queen tried successfully to block them from becoming eing sha e min or crown prince . she plotted with palace officials to place prince thi ba w on the throne , her second daughter sup ay alat 's lover . she practically isolated king mind n and give orders , as if it were by the king 's orders . the princes were summoned to the palace and arrested . the princes ny aung ok and the ny aung yan managed to escape . they run into the french embassy ' , now no th . state high school or formerly known as than dae ' school . his body guards including my great grandfather escaped into lower burma and some of them settled in ta un goo . king min don learned about the plot and ordered the princes to be released . kin w un min gy i and the supreme court ( h lu t - daw ) were persuaded to believe that king mind n 's wished to appoint prince thi ba w as an eing sha e min and to marry sup ay alat . other princes were re - arrested . when king mind n passed away , just after the funeral , young inexperience and naive prince thi ba w was proclaimed king . he was the son of the almost unknown or least powerful la un g she queen . the sal in princess , eldest daughter of mind n min , who was the princess reserved according to an old custom , to be the queen of the next king , became a nun . thi ba w married the two sisters sup ay ag yi and sup ay alat . the elder , sup ay ag yi , should be the chief queen , but sup ay alat forced her to live a life of retirement in the palace . on february , the intern ed princes , together with some princesses , a queen and some notables , altogether over persons , were murdered . another greater massacre took place in . about remaining members of the royal family , who had escaped in , were cru elly butchered . so my great grand father luckily escaped the massacres . his daughter - in - law , pure burmese lady who converted to islam and was disowned by her family for the crime of marrying a kala ' was wi do wed soon and was very poor but she managed to give all of her children good education . eldest son became a famous head master and he is my father . and she was very proud to see , before she departed , that more than two dozens of her grandchildren got the university degrees including many doctors and engineers . the rest is history . but now only myanmar military rulers are labeling us as guest citizens , kala ' or mixed blooded persons or not pure citizens . that , however , could not make us , or people like us , to become non burmese citizens . we are burmese citizens no matter how some might disagree , or wish otherwise or decreed by force . whether mixed blooded or not is not important in the eyes of the whole world but spdc could not deny our right of pure burmese citizenship ! we , and all the other persons like us , not just those indians , chinese , b eng alis or pakistanis although we are undeniably mixed blooded immigrants ' children or descendants of immigrants , but we are now full burmese citizens . no matter what some like spdc racists or their cohorts might say contrary . our great grand parents and all the ancestors were loyal citizens of burma and all of them were and are holding the burmese national registration cards or ah my o thar m hat p one tin cards ' . my brothers and sisters ' family members are holding those burmese national registration cards but now the spdc apartheid r gime had ordered to issue the differently formatted cards for their younger children . it is curious when the parents and elder brothers and sisters are the same citizens as our burmese buddhists at least on paper but now only their youngest children are blatantly or bra z enly discriminated as different from others and their own elder siblings . this racial discrimination is practiced on not only muslims but on chinese and h in di s . spdc national registration officers decreed that if any one is not pure burmese buddhist , could not claim to be pure blood and all the burmese muslims must be recorded as mixed blooded persons . whether correct or not , know or not , must be enlisted as mixed blooded indian , pakistan or bengali . so it is blatant racial discrimination or openly practicing apartheid practice of spdc junta . my ne phe ws and ni eces are forced to begin their journey of life differently from their elder siblings and face the reality of the unfair world . we believe that no one has that right to practice the issuing of apartheid certificate or new type of registration different from other citizens to us . by doing so , spdc is clearly starting to commit a genocide offence . our children are entitled to their dreams and should not encounter any dis ap po in tments even before they started their tender lives . we wonder how that single document would change their dreams or what would be their vision of their world or myanmar excluding them or shutting out all of them from all the opportunities . it is our children 's turning points of their lives . spdc ruthlessly had shown them who they are , why and how they are not welcomed in burma myanmar . most importantly , spdc have shown our children a real rejection . in waking to this realization , we suddenly understand that spdc have already failed all our children 's future . as our children journey into an uncertain future , they will struggle and grapple with their sense of their rightful place in this myanmar nation . the constant emphasis on differences by the narrow minded spdc apartheid racists who could not see value in these children prevent them from being seen , seeing themselves , as anything other than burmese citizens . and so spdc junta 's dancing with shadows continues , to their pi ed - piper song of unity and integration in single race and religion , to the beat of their war drums , changing burma into a myanmar world of so much bigotry and hatred . our young children 's every early moments would be yet under another hammer blow , temper ing or compromising their fantastic visions into list less and endless compromise under spdc and cohorts . our country 's diversity makes us who we are and what we are today , that can not be emphasized enough . and though we burmese muslims may each resonate differently , har mon izing only at some points in time and never universally , that is we are completely bur man ized culturally but differ in religion only but i am sure when we dream as burmese only because we know burmese , we love burmese , and burmese only is in our heart and mind . successive burmese kings had accepted us as their loyal subjects or citizens , after independence u nu 's government had accepted us . and general aung san had even promised us : \" i want to address the indians and chinese residing in this country . we have no bit tern ess , no ill will for them , or for that matter for any race and nationality in the world . if they choose to join us , we will welcome them as our own brethren . the welfare of all people of this country irrespective of race or religion has always been the one purpose that i have set out to fulfill . in fact it is my life 's mission . \" but sadly those illegitimate illegal spdc r gime is practicing apartheid committing the genocide on all of us . i could guarantee to all of our burmese friends that we are all burmese in our heart and we have no intention or imagination to even support the foreign countries believed to be the homeland of our ancient ancestors even if burma is at war with them ! please give back our children at least a chance to dream . please do not shut off their future . ko tin ma ung you could read the above article in burmese myanmar .

( ) we 've been merging all the other articles , is tifa to be allowed her own ? i do n't feel strongly either way , but my problem is if tifa is allowed her own article i can see people saying that characters such as barret , or the turks etc should have their own article . eventually reversing all we 've done . opinions ? : i feel that tifa is important enough to merit her own article , as one of the primary love interests ( per precedent with rin oa in the ch ars of ff viii article ; rin oa is a similar case ) . also , it does n't feel right leaving out the last corner of the love triangle between cloud , tifa , and aerith ( or square , if you count zack ) . : she should have her own article just because she 's a love interest ? that sounds quite in - universe . i think she does merit her own article , but only because there are enough out - of - universe information about her ( like how she was n't in the original script of the game , etc . ) . : just fyi , i did n't say that 's the primary reason . i just felt it would be aesthetically pleasing if she had her own article , as part of the triangle . : if the reception section gets expanded , i think she can have her own article . if not , i agree with gavin . if we build up the article from an out of universe perspective then we should keep it by all means , per [ wiki link : wp : fict ] . though , if we merged her i 'd like to merge aerith as well . regardless , both aerith and tifa 's entries in this article need to be expanded . i just noticed i 've done aerith already - i think tifa should be expanded upon though , i might have a go later but bit busy this weekend . imho , the article should not be merged . tifa is a crucial character to ff , easily deserving her own article . all other ff characters should have their own articles too . we 're talking about one of the best games ever made here . tifa 's role i know we 're having trouble working out tifa 's relation to being either the love interest or just one of two . do we think this image perhaps hints that she is the central love interest ? im not saying its a reference or evidence . just an idea . tifa 's role is that of emotional support for cloud , not to be his love interest or booty call . : from the official square - enix sight , which i linked to back in january ' it says the following : [ external link : aeris ' page ] \" her unusual abilities enable her to use magic , but she seems more interested in the deep ening love triangle between herself , cloud and tifa . \" : [ external link : tifa 's page ] \" she and cloud were childhood friends , and although she has strong feelings for him , she will never admit it . \" : significant ? \" major character \" division there is no justifiable reason for vincent valentine and zack fair to have the distinction of major characters while the rest of the cast ( especially important characters such as aerith gain s borough ) are relegated to a separate status . this is especially true considering that in final fantasy vii , vincent is an optional character and zack fair is not playable at all . this is an article on ffvii characters - please change the article to be consistent with the source material . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : zack and vincent are playable characters in their own games . thus , they are more important than characters who do not have their own games . : this is not the page for characters of those games , it is the page for final fantasy vii characters . also , being a main character does not necessarily mean that you are important or central - the playable character often serves as a lens . at the very least , aeris ( th ) should be given the distinction of a central character . she is at least as important to the games as sephiroth and can easily be seen as the spiritual mascot . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : as stated in the intro , this is the article for characters of the compilation of final fantasy vii . : ( edit conflict ) i think it is clearly for all titles in the compilation , noting the sections labeled \" before crisis characters \" , \" advent children characters \" , \" dirge of cerberus characters \" , and \" crisis core characters \" . the current criteria for being \" central \" appears to be being the main playable character in a game and sephiroth since he 's the main villain . : then the criteria should be subject to re - examination . to dis include aeris ( the mover ) is just preposterous . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : state why you think it is preposterous or your opinion wo n't matter . : i did state why , however briefly . : aeris is a primary character because she is the mover . while arguments can be made against the idea that she is what drew cloud to the shin - ra building and got the ball rolling in the first place , it 's fairly indisputable that by the time they got to the temple of the ancients , she was giving guidance to their mostly me andering quest . she is also the first to call cloud 's true identity into question . : aeris is the counterpoint to sephiroth , the real last ancient , and becomes important enough for him to single out and kill as she is the one with the power to call holy . her death becomes one major motivating force for the rest of the team and by the time they know why she died , their goal is to help her save the planet by freeing up whatever is blocking holy . when holy does come , it comes with the life stream , and we see aeris ' face - it is understood that while cloud killed sephiroth , aeris is the one who saved the planet . : aeris takes a major thematic role throughout the compilation , as well . she guides cloud again in advent children and the source of some of cloud 's inner struggle comes from his inability to resolve the guilt he carries for not being able to protect her . she cle ans es geo stigma and by the end is being painted as the force that stands in opposition to jen ova , which is a pretty he fty distinction . by the end credits , it is aeris and cloud who we see , rather than all the other characters . : then , we have the fact that she has an entire work dedicated to her , \" the maiden who travels the planet , \" i believe it 's called . : is this enough evidence ? frankly , i think it should be obvious from playing the original game that aeris is of huge importance . if i remembered some of the comments made by the creators to support that , i 'd cite them , as well . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by as she only had a big part in ffvii , and not in the rest of the compilation , i do n't think she 's a major character . it 's fine the way it is now . ps : please log in create an account . : but zack and vincent only have big parts in dirge of cerberus and crisis core , so there goes your argument . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : no , it does n't . zack and vincent are the only major characters in their games . aerith is one of them in ffvii . : in their games . in the original , they are both wholly optional . aeris is more integral to the story than both of them . : it should also be noted that aeris is one of the three characters ( the other two being cloud and sephiroth ) who appear on the ps case to ffvii ( or at least the us version , i 'm not sure . ) also , discounting the red xiii ending , she 's both the first and last character to appear in the game . she plays a similar \" mover \" role in advent children as in ffvii , being a key source of motivation to cloud through his visions of her . while i have n't played crisis core , it seems most likely that she would be a source of motivation to zach in that game as well . ( ) if i may suggest an alternative . \" main protagonists main antagonists other characters \" worked well for [ wiki link : characters of kingdom hearts ] . i 'm not entirely familiar with the ffvii games , but i believe most of the characters would fall under \" main protagonists main antagonists minor ffvii characters \" along with the specific \" before crisis characters advent children characters dirge of cerberus characters crisis core characters \" . just a thought . ( ) : i think this is an excellent solution , by the way . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : my main criticism of the anon ip user 's argument is that it 's based on a subjective evaluation of aerith 's importance as a character . on wikipedia , we must avoid such [ wiki link : wp : or original research ] - style rankings and go by the cold hard facts . and the fact is that cloud , zack , and vincent are the main characters \" stars \" of their own games . : but sephiroth is not . so if exceptions are made for important re - occuring characters , why sephiroth but not aeris ? preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by since i proposed the current set - up i suppose i should defend it . the main antagonist protagonist etc will not work her because the article deals with multiple games and other media . the main characters in each part of the compilation are as follows . * final fantasy vii : cloud * before crisis : the turks - however as there is no central turk in the game , they do n't have a place in the central character section . * dirge of cerberus : vincent * crisis core : zack * advent children : cloud * last order : cloud sephiroth is the central antagonist of the entire series - cloud is not the central protagonist of all the games films however . so thats why sephiroth is in the main characters section . i originally put aerith into the main characters section as i always saw her as a primary mover - however she does not have her own media and thus , is not in the section . it is that simple - if they have their own game , they are a main character . the main villain over all is sephiroth . which is why he is there . ax em titanium knows what he 's talking about here , or and therefore my personal interpretation of aerith 's role doesnt come into it . : the problem is that you are mis con str u ing these characters as the most integral to the story , and especially int he case of vincent and zack , that 's just not usually the case . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : i understand that the characters span several titles in multiple mediums , however i believe they still mostly fall into either a protagonist or antagonist role in the overall story . the characters of kingdom hearts spanned multiple titles as well . ( ) i have looked at the kingdom hearts article and the way its split would help not us here , for example - people might want to have red xiii in the main protagonist section - would he fit ? no , his role is only major in the original fantasy vii game . this is the same with barret and cid . cait sith actually gets more air time in the entire compilation that barret , red or cid . so does yu ffi e - one of those optional characters . fact is , we have the best solution . vincent is a far more important character in terms of the overall compilation than anyone other than cloud - if you consider the large role he plays in advent children ( his time ec lip ses bar re ts , ci ds , cait si ths , yu f fies , red xiii 's . the fact he has his own game , he is in before crisis i believe . arguably , rufus has a bigger part to play also . lets break this down again . * cloud : original game ; before crisis ; advent children ; last order ; crisis core * tifa : original game ; advent children ; * aerith : original game ; advent children ; * barret : original game ; * cid : original game ; * cait sith : original game ; dirge of cerberus * red xii : original game ; * yu ffi e : dirge of cerberus ; * vincent : before crisis ; advent children ; dirge of cerberus * zack : last order ; crisis core * sephiroth : original game ; advent children ; last order ; crisis core * rufus : original game ; before crisis ; advent children ; if the character plays a major part in one of the games films then they have that game film listed next to them in bold , if its a game film where they are the central character its italic and bold . so you see why main protagonist wouldnt solve any problem . as in terms of the entire compilation the main protagonists are : cloud , zack , vincent . the only main antagonist is sephiroth . rufus is n't really a protagonist or antagonist by advent children is he . so he could n't fit into that section . he is simply a major character . more major than barret , cid , red , cait sith or yu ffi e perhaps . any further opinions ? : actually , i do n't see how the protagonist antagonist division would n't solve any problem . i also do n't see why anybody would want to put red xiii in the antagonist section either , but like i said , i 'm not entirely familiar with the entire story . i think we may be looking at the characters in different ways . in my mind i see a clear division of sides among the characters as they relate to the entire story that spans the different ffvii titles . i assume you are looking at them as they relate to each individual game ( correct me if i 'm wrong ) . in cleaning up the kh characters article , we had some characters types that were in between the protagonist and antagonist classification . [ wiki link : characters of kingdom hearts ri ku ] for example , was an antagonist through out most of the first game , but switched back to being a protagonist . [ wiki link : characters of kingdom hearts nam in ] started out in an antagonist capacity but also switched to being a protagonist . we ended up putting them in the \" main protagonists \" because of their overall role . i think rufus is similar to ri ku and nam in , except he fits into the antagonist role more . but that 's just my view point , you obviously have a different one , as i 'm sure others here have their own as well . ( ) : apologies , i meant red xiii in the main protagonist section , however he wouldnt fit in it . the only characters who would fit into the section of main protagonist would be : cloud , vincent zack . as i have shown above all other main protagonists from the original game are only primary in the realms of the original game . it wouldnt solve the problem - main character or main protagonist , whatever you want to call it it would contain the exact same people . : well , if that 's how you see it , then that 's how you see it . though technically , it 's all subjective ; both your way and mine . by the reasoning you 've stated , the organization used of [ wiki link : characters of kingdom hearts ] does n't appropriately organize the kh characters . but this article is not of high importance on my personal list of things to do on wikipedia . so if you feel this is the best method , go for it . just thought i 'd give my two cents . good luck with it and happy editing . ( ) its good to have experienced editors give their opinions ! so thanks , sadly im not familiar with the kingdom hearts story so i wouldnt know . thanks very much , you too . article title change ? would it be better if the article was called , [ wiki link : characters of the compilation of final fantasy vii ] ? : eh hh , it 's kind of wordy and it seems to be explained well enough in the intro , although it could be better . also , the original ffvii is n't part of the compilation . it 's correct enough in its current form and more succinct , to boot . : the current title is correct since \" final fantasy vii \" is pretty much the name of a ( sub - ) franchise , not just the name of a game . this just has to be made clear in the introduction . the current lead is too much focused on the first game ; it only gives a passing mention of its sequels then concludes on how much copies the first game sold . stating how much the whole ffvii sub franchise sold would be more relevant i think . : i think we should use the lead in [ wiki link : characters of final fantasy viii ] and as an example . : i 've made a wee edit to the intro - thanks for improving it though ! so i think thats good for now , might need expanded if we wanted to move this up to ga status . opinions all ? cait 's sentience it is plainly obvious from the source . given the fact that cait says the word ' see ' , as well as the advent of the sentence as a whole , determines that the sentence has a pre - requisite - which is obviously the advent of cait portraying to the team that he \" did n't \" have feelings or had any sentience within him , and , the advent of cait using the word , ' i ' . if cait did n't have to choose to sacrifice himself because reeve would have made him do it anyway , cait would have used to word , ' we ' - as in cait and reeve together . the concept in question is very obvious and was made in the article before it was merged . some interpretation is needed as long as it coincides with the reference ; meaning , that is why you ca n't copy and paste from books or web sites . : hi there , and thanks for not getting into an edit war . sadly i ca n't quite make out your argument . i think your saying cait sith appeared to have no sentience then , at the temple of the ancients we became aware of it . clearly in dirge of cerberus cait sith has at least limited sentience - we can tell just by the way reeve interacts with him . so if your arguing cait sith was a sentient being - then yes , to some degree he was . : i also have a hard time following your argument ( your use of the word \" advent \" is unclear ) . my position is that his degree of sentience can not be determined and cited from the game scripts without an unacceptable amount of [ wiki link : wp : or original synthesis and interpretation ] of the dialogue . : ax em is correct here , if a game designer or some third party stated that he was indeed sentient then we could include it . sadly , its just our interpretation . which is why we cant use it . nonsense . if you ca n't interpret simple dialogue and use it acc ro ding to the fundamentals of logic in relation to the alphabet english language , then i guess you ca n't interpret the fact that reeve had a \" change of heart \" because he does n't actually say it , and the director or programmers did n't say it . also , when pro tra ying that the fortune cait reads about cloud and aeris is n't exactly ' clear ' , we should n't even apply to this because the narrative does n't actually say it is n't ' clear ' , and , since the director or programmers did n't say it was n't clear . also , there does n't seem to be any large allo tments of interpretation in respect to this arguement because the narrative obviously states that cait felt pain ( \" ow \" ) ; the narrative also states that he felt in general ( \" she said ' be strong ' . i feel so happy \" ) ; the narrative also states that cait refered to himself as a sentient being since he used narrative the sentence : \" theres plenty of stuffed toys like my body around , but theres only one me \" . if reeve was talking , then the concept of \" only one me \" could n't apply , and , futhermore , we would have to state that it was in fact reeve saying theres \" only one me \" ( perhaps a bit of self - right ousness ? ) since the arguement of sentience is still being processed and no programmers or directors actually said it was n't reeve . so , if you ca n't provide footnotes with the narratives stat em ets and portrayals , i 'm afraid we 're going to have to rewrite this whole article which is a requisite to that idea . ( : i 'm not talking about the rest of the article . i have n't gone through it with my or detector ray yet so i would n't know . anyway , there is a difference between substituting a word in the script with a synonym and drawing such conclusions . saying \" o www \" and \" i feel so happy \" do not , by definition , denote sentience so it is too far a stretch to make that statement . as well , the \" only one me \" thing could just be for comedic ironic effect but we ca n't know since wikipedia operates on verifiability and not speculation about the writers ' intentions . again , i 'm not disagreeing with your assertion , per se . i just do n't find the evidence sufficient for a verifiable statement on wikipedia . yes , maybe the word ' sentience ' would be too strong of position towards our interpretation of the narrative . maybe i ' l describe the pertaining narrative in a sentence rather than one word . i actually have read most of the re ms of use for wikipedia . you probably read the paragraph below but missed the second paragraph . \" wikipedia does not publish original research or original thought . this includes unpublished facts , arguments , speculation , and ideas ; and any unpublished analysis or synthesis of published material that serves to advance a position . this means that wikipedia is not the place to publish your opinions , experiences , or arguments . citing sources and avoiding original research are in ex tric ably linked : to demonstrate that you are not presenting original research , you must cite reliable sources that provide information directly related to the topic of the article , and that directly support the information as it is presented . \" secondary sources are accounts at least one step removed from an event .

there 's too much room for interpretation to make a definitive statement about his sentience from these or any lines in the script . he is right about me being a little rude when i st started editing . thanks for clearing up the contexts of wikipedias ' primary sources for me . if its about a consensus we have to wait at least a months time to truly get every bod ys ' opinion - or even longer . so far , there has been around - editors besides me in the discussion but thats hardly enough . i 'm going to have to stick with the primary source since the majority of people could still apply the concept of easy verifiability . : is there not a quote that could be taken from dirge of cerberus that we could use to show cait 's sentience , after all reeve does call him a he and he is shown to work independently and appears to show conscious thought . the case for sentience is certainly made allot strong in doc than in ffvii : that may be , but we also know that there are multiple cait si ths . the technology may have improved in years , allowing him to have some sort of ai which is not present in the original ffvii . at best , i think the question of his sentience is n't notable enough to include anyway . cait is a rather minor character , despite being playable . : indeed , he gets quite a large amount of coverage as it is . however a sentence on his possible sentience ca n't do any harm i . e . \" cait sith appears to have the traits of a sentient being , displaying what seems to be conscious thought when he considers his role in saving the planet or when he appears to act independently of reeve and is affectionately referred to as \" you know who \" by his controller in dirge of cerberus . however the actual status of cait 's independence is never made clear nor is the issue of his sentience . it is possible that he is simply a very advanced [ wiki link : ai ] system who appears to be sentient . since his task is to carry out spying and espionage this is very possible . cait sith 's sentience or possible lack of it is a continuing debate amongst fans of final fantasy vii . \" : again , unfortunately this is hardly sourceable . and dances around or . : the narrative states that cait refered to himself as a sentient being since he used narrative the sentence , \" theres plenty of stuffed toys like my body around , but theres only one me \" . if reeve was talking , then the concept of \" only one me \" could n't apply because he was n't dying ( perhaps a bit of self - right ousness ? ) , and futhermore , we would have to state that it was in fact reeve saying theres \" only one me \" since the arguement of sentience is still being processed and no programmers or directors actually said it was n't reeve nor did they say that reeve had a \" stuffed body \" . so , if you ca n't provide footnotes with the narratives ' stat em ets and portrayals , i 'm afraid we 're going to have to rewrite this whole article which is a requisite to that idea . what does the ul ti mania guide say about it ?

( this point alone is quite enough to stop the merging process . ) * his very small role in final fantasy vii - advent children proved to be of importance where he saved cloud and revealed very important plot points in two scenes ( after he saved cloud and in the aircraft ! ) here a few ' trivia ' points on why should n't the articles be merged ; * he 's one of the coolest characters in the series even competing with cloud ! * he 's one of the coolest characters of all time ! d for the love of god , do not merge the articles ! : i feel that vincent and zack definitely have enough to be notable . tifa i would say not to merge since it would not be an efficient way to convey the information and she has played a major supporting role in many games . : if they have it , you should be able to provide it or provide possible locations that people can check . i 'm definitely not saying that it 's impossible , but someone needs to actually show it before it 's declared fact . as for tifa , if she needs a larger section than the other \" secondary \" main characters , she can have one , but we certainly do n't keep articles around just because we find them useful . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures comment ] was added at : i think vincent is notable enough , per sephiroth b cr . i 'm neutral about whether tifa should be merged or not , but i think zack 's article should be merged because : it has no information about his creation or reception , no sources , the prose is badly written , and i also think that he should n't have his own article before crisis core is released . : well , per [ wiki link : wp : crystal ] , it 's alright as long as it is almost certain to take place , which it is , since the release date has been announced and it 's not too long from now . vincent i believe requires his own article , as does zack as they both have their own games . tifa i 'm not so sure about . what is the rationale behind her having her own article , is she really notable enough ? : tifa is the most important secondary character in several titles so , on some level , i suppose that importance adds up . : do they though , and is calling her the most important secondary character not really depending on your interpretation . i mean , it is fair to say aerith is the most important character after cloud in the original game and attribute her equal importance in advent children . it would be a stretch but its possible . im not saying tifa should n't have her own article i was just wondering what the notability was . : well , she has a fair bit of out - of - universe info as well . i recall that in development , her character was added so that aerith could die . that sounds pretty notable . : i think we 're missing the point of notability here . notability does n't stem from appearing in games or having a couple of production notes . it comes from having plenty of creation and reception information due to the games and having plenty of creation and reception information to back up those few production notes . again , i am not saying that it is impossible for these three to be improved , but we should have some actual proof before using superficial standards of notability . : or we could improve first before deciding to merge or not . : indeed , improving the article should be our first intention , merging can take place should we fail to find enough out of game information to add to the article . : that would fall under my criteria of actual proof . i hope i do n't seem like i 'm trying to rush things . it 's just that people often get too caught up in potential notability , while it 's not always that clear . if you have actual information or actually know where to find it , that 's a completely different story . it just does n't seem that way from the above comments . : so then , are we atleast agreed that vincent requires his own article , if thats the case will he be removed from the suggested merger box ? majority of opinion seems to favour tifa maintaining her own article . i believe that it should therefore be kept on the basis that it will be given high priority for a revamp . : seeing as only five people in total have really commented on this , it seems a little hasty to remove the tags . i 'm certainly not against attempted improvement , but that can be done with the tags still there . i would rather someone just post some sources that set up obvious potential , so they can just be removed anyways . i thought we were all about rushing and haste ? seriously though , are there any specific points in any of these three articles that you think must be improved before they can warrant stand alone status ? i mean , as far as i can tell regardless of the state [ wiki link : wikipedia : fict notable topics merit individual articles vincent certainly deserves his own article ] as he is the main character in his own , and a major character in several hugely successful video games . in fact , other than a lack of sources i do n't see what the problem is with vincent 's article . also , i do n't believe a lack of sources means an article should be merged . otherwise i could see a huge amount of articles being deleted . my thoughts turn to a large amount of historical figures here on wikipedia whose articles are perhaps very much lacking sources . anyway , any pointers you think we might need to improve to keep these articles independent ? : they need to show the potential to at least reach the level of aerith . while they have a little bit of relevant information , the current information could easily be worked into this list . even if vincent and zack have their own games , they does n't need articles without enough real world information to hold them . : but they do merit them per the instructions put down in [ wiki link : wp : fict ] . regardless of the current content they do have the merit to be individual articles , if research was done they could be expanded further , that research will be done , as editors here have pledged . so surely , it is better for the project and its users that they maintain their individual articles . nothing is gained from merging them here . : for characters to have articles per our notability guidelines and [ wiki link : wp : waf ] , they need to have a significant amount of ( potential ) real world information that is completely separate from the parent topic . it 's not just \" we have two sources ; that 's good . \" or \" we have a potential indicator of potential sources ; that 's good . \" in this case , they should show the potential to reach at least the level of aerith . at this point , the only show a little bit of potential ( based on objective criteria , not subjective opinions ) , and it 's nowhere near needing to be split . that can easily change , though . i suspect these articles will be up to standard by the time enough people post here to give some sort of consensus or majority of opinion , since its usually the same few who post here anyway . so , i suppose these articles will remain in the mean time . : ( to ttn ) either way , sources do n't appear out of thin air . it requires time and effort to find good sources . if we were to go through all the trouble to find the sources necessary to prove \" potential for notability \" , we might as well just fix them right now . alas , not everyone can summon that kind of free time on the spot . : again , i 'm not trying to rush this or anything . i 'm just trying to keep this away from the dangerous road of complete speculation . there is no rush here , so please do take your time on working with them . : will you be joining in the search for sources and article improvement ? you 've made a few good edits on this article already . dirge of cerberus ? should n't we have a small dirge of cerberus section on this page ? fantasy leader : yeah , the article agreed earlier to have one but moved it to the doc page , a small section will be put back however . vincent a central character ? this might just be me , but although vincent is one of the coolest characters of ff , i strongly disagree that he is one of the central characters . heck , he 's not even an essential part ot the plot or the gameplay because it is just an option to play as him . i do n't think he belongs in the same ranking as cloud or sephiroth . mr . dude : this page is ranked on both compilation of ffvii and ffvii importance . cloud and sephiroth are both important , being the original protagonist and antagonist . zack and vincent are central characters because they get their own games . zack stars in crisis core and last order , to an extent . vincent stars in two games ; dirge of cerberus and dirge of cerberus : lost episode . that 's why vincent is ranked that way ; he has his own game . crisis core descriptions the descriptions for crisis core characters had several mi str u ths and very little information . i just added some more material taken from the ul ti mania guide and the game itself . i do believe ho jo took over as head of the science department from g ast , not hol lander . hol lander and ho jo were both v ying for the recognition and when g ast left , ho jo won out because jen ova project g was a miserable failure . when he became head of the department he basically relegated hol lander to a nobody . i 'll go double check though before making any changes . deleted ? just wondering what happened to the page . a large sum of it seems to have been removed ( four ' central ' characters remain ) . unless lack of sleep has something to do with it , i can not see any link to a list of final fantasy vii characters page or something similar . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : i thought it was just my computer , but i guess not . i think i know what to do ; just a sec . : alright ! fixed ! vincent is not a central character you can play the entire game through without him , thus , he is not an essential part of the game . please move him to other major characters . in addition , aerith has a su pre mely major part in the story line and should be moved to central . sam - man - zhi : in real tion to the entire compilation of final fantasy vii he is a central character as he is the central character of his own game - that is the qualification for entry to that section . : i believe this was discussed earlier on this talk page , but basically what gavin scott said . \" characters of the compilation of final fantasy vii \" would be too much of a mouth ful to use as the title , but it 's pretty much stated what the list is in relation to . the central characters are the characters with their own game a movie centered around them ; vincent had dirge of cerberus and doc lost episode . merger of zack fair here he barely has any information as it is , so all of his information could sit here , build up this article and eliminate an article stub without losing any information in the process . : i think it was talked about earlier ( very briefly in another section ) but decided that because he is a fairly new main character , it could stay . i 'm sure there is some reception and concept creation information out there , but i 've been a little busy with some merges and no one else has really stepped up . it seems to be in about the same shape as [ wiki link : vincent valentine ] ; though the latter has more information , it 's nearly all unsourced anyway . i would n't mind improving the article , but i do n't think i have the time and patience to tackle it alone right now . i 'll stay un determined unless a reliable editor decides to help with it . : i did most the mergers back in the early days ! i 've taken a break from all the ha stle you get from doing that ! haha , ex cell ant work though ! oh , and a big shout to who did allot of it too . ) anyway , yes the consensus was that zack should have his own article as he has his own computer game and the information needed to improve the article exists . vincent valentine hey , i noticed that the bit on vincent did n't say he 's optional in the original game . i know , by canon you get both him and [ wiki link : yu ffi e ] , but you do n't have to get him to complete the game , so i put that note in there . hope that 's okay . - yeah , i 'd say it is . he is after all optional , and is n't actually needed , but he 's a cool character to have , with good attacks and limits . fact : [ wiki link : vincent valentine ] is an optional character in in the [ wiki link : fictional ] game of [ wiki link : final fantasy vii ] . he is not actually needed to complete the game , although he makes several ap pe aren ces in [ wiki link : final fantasy vii : advent children ] and plays the main role of [ wiki link : dirge of cerberus : final fantasy vii ] . image copyright problem with file : c ri si score artwork . png the image [ wiki link : file : c ri si score artwork . png ] is used in this article under a claim of [ wiki link : wp : nfc fair use ] , but it does not have an adequate explanation for why it meets the [ wiki link : wp : nfcc requirements for such images ] when used here . in particular , for each page the image is used on , it must have an [ wiki link : wikipedia : non - free use rationale guideline explanation ] linking to that page which explains why it needs to be used on that page . please check : * that there is a [ wiki link : wikipedia : non - free use rationale guideline non - free use rationale ] on the image 's description page for the use in this article . : * that this article is linked to from the image description page . this is an automated notice by . for assistance on the image use policy , see [ wiki link : wikipedia : media copyright questions\n",

no n ? alphabet applications this is just a shot in the dark , but is it not more logical to call it the roman alphabet ? i consider the latin alphabet to be the roman alphabet adjusted to the sounds of the latin language , just like all the other systems . for instance , the letter ' w ' in the german language is adjusted to be the same sound as the letter ' v ' in english . if a german said to me , in his native language , \" i work for bmw \" , and i were to write that in the latin alphabet with no previous knowledge of german , i would write bmw as ' b mv ' , because that 's how he would say it . so what i mean is , the roman alphabet adjusted for the german language is the ' german ' alphabet , the roman alphabet adjusted for the english language is the ' english ' alphabet , and the roman alphabet adjusted for the latin language is the ' latin ' alphabet . it was , after all , the roman empire which was the principle cause of the adoption of this alphabet by the linguists of europe , so i can not see how it would be unfair to call it by this name . i 'm hoping for the opinion of someone better placed to decide than me , as i am not a linguistics graduate . july . : it would make more sense , but \" latin alphabet \" is far and away the more common name . : considering that \" latin alphabet \" does appear to be the more common name , why is it that we seem to talk exclusively about \" roman izing \" text from other scripts rather than \" lat ini zing \" it ? : perhaps it is the more common name in america ? i 've never known anyone call it the latin alphabet . it 's always been the roman alphabet . if there 's a distinction , i would say that the latin alphabet did n't traditionally include j or v as independent letters , or w , whereas the term roman alphabet denotes the - letter entity . - calling it roman is more common in the us , also . however , the latin alphabet was standardized as \" latin \" by international committees , and that is now the technical term . but there is a bigger problem - this article breaks out the \" english \" alphabet as different from the latin alphabet . in fact , the modern latin alphabet and the modern english alphabet are the exact same . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by latin names of the letters ? ! hi , these latin names of the letters confuse me , even though the author readily admits that the names are disputed . the table says the y was called \" i gra eca \" . how is this possible ? in the classical era , the y was used in greek words to display the sound of the french u and the german . why would the romans call that letter \" greek i \" when it was pronounced differently ? and then the x . according to the article , the letter was called \" ex \" , as in english . this seems highly in plausible to me . in all other languages i know , this letter is called \" ix \" . this goes for both germanic and romance languages . so what the . ? : you have a point about \" x \" . as for \" y \" , the article explains that : the letter y when introduced was probably called hy as in greek ( the name [ wiki link : up silon ] being not yet in use ) but was changed to i gra eca ( \" greek i \" ) as latin speakers had difficulty distinguishing and . windows font for [ wiki link : roman square capitals ] which font do you use to get an ancient epi graphy impression ?

      "i 've left the following new additions as they are for now , but i have several problems with them : spanish has a smaller phonemic inventory than portuguese : it lacks completely the ? , v and z consonants , features d ? only in some dialects , has a a different set of [ wiki link : rho tic consonants ] and uses only the five basic vowels ( a , e , i , o , u ) and only one semi vowel ( j , sometimes produced as d ? instead ) . : in contrast , portuguese only lacks one consonant present in spanish ( ? ) , knows both spanish rho tic consonants and has two more and uses a complex vowel inventory featuring eight basic vowels ( a , ? , e , ? , i , o , ? , u ) two semi vowels ( j and w ) and at least five [ wiki link : nasal vowels ] ( , e , i , and u ) . some dialects may have nasal pairs corresponding to a and ? , e and ? and o and ? which are [ wiki link : allophones ] . this should be carefully worded . while spanish lacks some of the phonemes of portuguese , the reverse is also true : portuguese lack the af fri cate \" ch \" , and the fricative \" z \" . looking in the [ wiki link : spanish phonology ] article , i count consonant phonemes in spanish , while portuguese has . not much of a difference . the really significant difference is in the vowels : phonemes in spanish , but arguably in portuguese ( though only in brazilian portuguese , which is likely more conservative in this respect ) . : well , i am no linguist and am writing from my own viewpoint ( i am familiar with most portuguese dialects and am a spanish teacher , having been to spain to perfect it ) . spanish appears to have less consonants than portuguese because some of the \" different \" phonemes are actually different dial ec tal re ali zations of the same base phoneme ( consider the three \" different \" e es ) . : for example . ? : concerning brazilian portuguese vowels , contrary to most older grammars ( those written decades ago ) , we do make distinction between rounded and un rounded a ( a and ) . the a of \" casa \" is not the same as the a of \" cam a \" and nas alisation has nothing to do with . at least not in the pronunciation most people are using today . : they are different phones , but they are allophones of the same [ wiki link : phoneme ] . incidentally , portuguese has no rounded vowels , aside from the back vowels o , ? , and u . : i am not so sure about the two a 's in bp being simply allophones of the same [ wiki link : phoneme ] . most brazilian dictionaries now transcribe as different phonemes . : also , the phoneme inventory i was alluding to was that found in standard spanish grammars . if the phoneme inventory is broadened to include any possible phoneme occurring in any dialect of both languages then perhaps there is not a single con son at that is not present on both languages , but would that be relevant to a rough and broad comparison of the languages ? what are we comparing here ? btw , how much is standard spanish artificial , even in comparison to actually spoken cas ti llan spanish ? i wrote that paragraph comparing standard brazilian portuguese and standard spanish but am aware that the phoneme inventory of portuguese in portugal is only slightly different ( they only use the phonemes in a different way ) . : read [ wiki link : spanish phonology ] and [ wiki link : portuguese phonology ] carefully , and you will see that what i wrote is right : consonant phonemes in portuguese , in spanish . : i am fixing the part about spanish having no w ( that was a sad mistake due to the late of the night ) but i insist that nasal vowels should be counted apart ( no , a foreigner would never guess is an allo phone of a unless his native language also features nas als . i know this from seeing how foreigners , especially those from us , germany and italy react to nas als ) . if we count nas als separately , then we have vowels in portuguese ( i forgot that there 's a different i in portugal somewhere ) . : i actually agree that spanish has no w phoneme ( as does [ wiki link : spanish phonology ] ) . as for the nasal vowels of portuguese , they are different phones from the oral vowels , but they can be regarded as re ali zations of the same phoneme . see mate us , maria helena & d' andrade , ernesto ( ) the phonology of portuguese isbn - x . : anyway , i do not question that portuguese has more vowels than spanish . what i do question , vehemently , is that is has ( much ) more consonants . but that finally boils down to the same basic question : the presence of these vowel phenomena in portuguese ( opposition between oral nasal and between front back vowels ) is what puts obstacles to mutual intelligibility and makes it as sy metric ( as spanish speakers do not know them ) . the amount of phonemes does not actually mean everything . if you re - write the section that way it will be ok to me , as i have said i am no linguist and am only adding information previously absent and took it from readily available sources . btw , thanks for the comments . ; - ) : the opposition between front and back vowels ( e , i versus o , u ) also exists in spanish . you probably meant to say \" the opposition between mid - high and mid - low vowels \" ( , versus , ) . anyway , i see what you are saying , and i do agree that the larger number of vowel phonemes and allophones in portuguese than in spanish can be an obstacle for spanish - speakers learning portuguese . i am not so sure , however , that it \" is what puts obstacles to mutual intelligibility \" . there are other possible explanations , for example the fact that spanish speakers are typically less exposed to the portuguese language than vice - versa . this is why i think theory that the imbalance in the number of vowels is what makes intelligibility difficult should be proven before being asserted . : but , regardless of these differences of opinion , i think you 've made an invaluable contribution to the article . thank you . also , only one of the rho tic phonemes truly differs between portuguese and spanish ; both languages have the [ wiki link : alveolar flap ] . : but brazilian portuguese has a \" soft \" r that sounds exactly like an as pirate ( h ) and a \" harder \" r that is identical to spanish j . they are found in different dialects , ok , but they are a permanent source of confusion for mutual intelligibility . i remember having a lot of fun telling my students that \" pu edes com er jam n , pero no pu edes com er ram n \" and seeing how they struggles to get the difference . : i 'm not sure what you mean by \" soft r \" , but most dialects of portuguese have the [ wiki link : alveolar flap ] ( the sound of the r in caro ) , as does spanish . they do not differ in this respect . : \" soft r \" is a realization of the \" thrill r \" that is quite similar to the spanish j , to the point that it causes confusion . it masks words in both ways . a spanish speaker , hearing a brazilian pronounce car ro ( \" car \" ) will think he is saying ca jo ( short form of car ajo ) . that 's what i meant . : but then portuguese and spanish do not have a \" different set of rho tic consonants \" . only one of the two rho tics differs . the following i have deleted : this the chief reason why portuguese speakers can understand spanish ( and italian ) easier than the other way around : they do n't have to struggle to understand phonemes they do n't know . it 's an arguable hypothesis that needs to be backed by evidence\n",

unfounded de mag ogy of dc on stalin , etc . - moldavian language in moldavia during soviet union used cyrillic alphabet ( by the way , another proof that there were two languages used in moldavia and not one , as dc says -

of the moldavian parliament ( the dif fin ition of the territorial units , their names and composition ; a law which can be found on the webpage of the parliament ; all laws are brought there up to date on a daily basis , that is , small changes are entered into the texts of the laws on the day of their add option - you can read all that stuff on the webpage of the parliament , it is a very strict procedure ) , moldova is divided into municipalities , ra ions , autonomous territorial unit , and special territorial unit . balti is one of the municipalities not sub or din ated to other units ( there is even a [ wiki link : administrative divisions of moldova wikipedia article ] explaining all that ) . the capital cities of the territorial units also have municipality status ( it is about the degree of financial autonomy ) , but unlike balti , those municipalities are not first tier territorial units of the country . legally and colo qu ally , the word municipality has two meanings : one of the first tier units , or one of the cities with that status . saying balti is one of or one of is giving preference to one notion over the other . much more correct would be to say balti is a municipality . i am not saying one can not elaborate on that , if you wish , but without giving preference to one of the two notions . * additionally : you can also see the template at the bottom of the article . you editted and deleted half the article without even reading it first . * additionally : well , then the template is wrong also and i will change it . there are five municipalities , not and not four . it 's basic mathematics . your info is good to be put in an article on moldavian municipalities , where you may explain the tier dif fe ren cies . moldopodo * disagree with dc - anyway , dc contradicts herself himself . it is clear the total number of municipalities in mod lo va is five and not more or less . consequently b l i is one of five municipalities . moldopodo * i support the dropping of the number . addition aly , \" municipality \" should link to the wiki article about administrative divisions of moldova . . it is often referred to as \" the capital of the north \" this was a proposal by some politicians , to add into moldovan legislation these words . it was opposed on the grounds that it says nothing specifically . it would be like giving in the con si tu tion of the new york state \" new york city is the capital of the south of the state \" . so , there is no such legal definition in moldova . however , those politicians have continued a pr cam pain to promote it . the ordinary citizens are led to believe that should the city receive such status , it would allow something that would allow to improve the economics of the city . but it would allow nothing , as there is no law about \" capitals of the north \" or \" capitals \" or sm th similar . it is a cheap way to blame some deficits of city administration of someone else , indefinite . now , i am not saying we can not cover these aspects in the article . but to say in the first paragraph of the article , and to state it like a definition , is to add opt a political view . i think a wikipedia article should not do that . a small paragraph about that down throught the text is ok by me . * additionally : please , re -

dc , again you are missing the point , it 's not about politics , please read the answers that are given to you . my city is referred to as a capital of the north or northern capital even on numerous internet sites , not only in english , russian or romanian . this is simply obvious . i invite you again to check google . moldopodo * do n't see the problem with it . it 's not like anyone 's going to relocate the capital there or something . i 'd suggest the \" northern capital \" , though . * disagree with dc - ) dc , please , give a precise link and source where such a legal political proposition was done ( personally have never heard of it ) ) where did you see politics and law in a poe tically colloquial reference , just like are called [ wiki link : ven ise ] , [ wiki link : saint petersburg ] or [ wiki link : rey k ja v k ] ? moldopodo * the nickname should be kept , ideally with a ref . . among a hilly landscape that used to be covered with forests in the [ wiki link : middle ages ] vs among a hilly landscape that is covered with forests since the [ wiki link : middle ages ] . during th century , extensive cutting of woods have occured to clear fields for agriculture . as a result , there is only one forrest south of the city , with very small woo ded areas somewhere else . therefore , to say it is covered is incorrect . [ wiki link : di mi trie can tem ir ] has described , among hundreds of other things , the flora and f oun a of the region , and he described a secular forrest with trees of big diameter . it would be very nice if that would be the situation today , but it is i logical to say it is covered with for rests now . * dc is correct here , afaik . * agree and i did not really have a problem with this . i guess it was left out in front of all the edits . moldopodo . in the middle of the [ wiki link : b l i steppe ] . this is a phrase that moldopodo keeps adding , and i keep deleting it . unfortunately , it is a politically motivated notion . the russian descriptions often used it , and they consider it as part of the southern - russian steppe . in international literature , one cal les the \" southern - russian steppe \" asian steppe , or eurasian steppe . wikipedia also uses the international terminology : [ wiki link : eurasian steppe ] , and its component [ wiki link : pontic - caspian steppe ] . according to the international literature and maps , the steppe lies mani ly to the east of the river dniester ( all the way to northern china ) , with only a small band along the black see shore on the western bank of dniester being steppe , which is - km from the city . the change in the relief and vegetation is quite sudden at the river dniester , and is due to the start of the pre - car path ian area . this is a well - known scientific fact . however , in the second half of the th century , when the notion balti steppe has appeared ( under the influence of the pan - slavist current in the russian empire ) , there were not so many geologists and travellers through the region . therefore , the idea that the steppe continues on the western shore of the dniester took hold in some literature due to its agressive promotion by the pan - slavist current . in the wake of deforestation of large areas in northern moldova in th century , this can be observed even by a child : the re ver s and creeks make deep g org es , but if you look at the - km areas between neighboring creeks , you see easy hills . as you go more to the south , these hills are more abrupt , up to slopes , but in the north , you have a slope . so , each of these - km areas look like bomb ated step ps ( only by relief , not by the traditional vegetation , which here are woods , not pra iries ) . but then , at creeks , one has big g org es , with - slopes . it is incorrect to call the whole of northern moldova steppe . it is not a traditional pra iries . you can find some areas up to - square miles in size that look like steppe , but not the whole north of the country . if you wish , see also the article geography of moldova for more details . * additionally : the pan - slavist origin i just gave for your information , i do not oppose it because it was pan - slavist , but because it is factually false . ( not everything pan - sla vists came with was false . ) for the article , the only thing it is relevant : it is not factual , it is not a [ wiki link : prairie ] . [ to moldopodo : what \" russian cono tation \" has the word steppe ? if you see a russian pan - slavist ( not all russians were pan - slavist in th century , there were equally strong currents ) cono tation , then yourself betray that you know that the term was invented . ] * do n't see how a neutral geographic description like \" b l i steppe \" ( not even \" belt skaya steppe \" ) can be pan - slavist , but whatever . if it 's factual - leave it be . if it 's factually incorrect - keep it out . * disagree - again unfounded de mag ogy of dc - to correct me , state me one source and link where it is said that b l i steppe is a pan - slavist or political or something like that . i guess you just do n't like the fact that the word is of russian origin ? b l i steppe is officially recorded by numerous sources ( check internet , britannica encyclopedia , etc . ) and has no specific political or russian con ota ion . and even if it had one ( i ca n't see which ) , would you call then mountain a river ? i dis ag ee and remind you , it 's about encylopedia and not your im ag in tion , dc . moldopodo * the balti steppe is an established geographical name , it has nothing to do with politics . . eli sa ve ta , moldova eliza ve ta and sad o voe , moldova sad o voe vs eliza ve tov ca and sad o voe there are two issues here . one , there sure are localities called sad o voe in other countries , and could be the same for eliza ve ta . second , the moldovan law xv - on the administrative division of the country calls it eliza ve ta . eliza ve tov ca was the name used during the soviet union , the name in russian . * you tell me , moldopodo , there is no other sad o voe in the whole world ? ) do you really believe that ? ) we can leave eliza ve ta without \" , moldova \" if you insist . the laws of a country have precedence over what mistake one might make on a road sign . please , no offence , but a child knows that . * since nobody knows about those villages anyway , official names are probably better . * disagree . i do not know any other sad o voe first of all . as for eliza ve tov ca , i was there recently , as you enter the village the sign says : \" eliza ve tov ca \" with latin characters . just type in google - eliza ve tov ca and eliza ve ta and tell me how many times more than zero will you find a reference to eliza ve ta as a village , suburb of b l i . moldopodo * it 's clear to everybody reading the article that those settlements are in moldova . and probably they are more sad o vo es and eliza ve tov cas in moldova . . the word b l i ( pl . of sing . \" balt \" ) is translated literally \" puddle pools \" vs the word b l i ( pl . of sing . \" balt \" ) is translated literally \" swamp , puddle pools \" . i am afraid that moldopodo does not know well en outh the romanian language and their fore makes his confusion . the po si bility of confusion is also increased by the fact that in russian , swamp is bo lo to , so it is very easy for one who knows russian but does not know proper romanian to make the mistake . * additionally : moldopodo , this is ridiculous . do you know romanian ? tell honestly ! if you do n't know the language of your own country even at a very - very simple level , proved by the fact that even with a dictionary you make mistakes in a word that means the name of the city you live in , then please . give us a brake with your super - knowledge of the language you do n't bother learn even at an elementary level . you have to translate \" bal ta \" from romanian to english , not swamp from english to romanian . you found a dictionary that does not even have \" bal ta \" - it is a dictionary in construction ! here is a good online dictionary , i 've used it for - years : [ externa link : http : www . diction are . com ] . alternatively , go to the library , pick up a dictionary , and make a small effort to learn a few words in the official language of your own country . it is a very simple language to learn , it is not chinese or hungarian to have to learn from zero . foreigners come to moldova and in year speak the language . you live there for years and do n't bother . instead you blame people of nationalism . and what is your lack of knowledge of romanian , not nationalism ? noone asks you to write literature , but , - , words anyone can learn . : * disagree . by the way , something tells me that romanian version ( balt ) of swamp is somehow related to russian version of swamp ( bo lo to ) . as for translation , i will not fall into an empty of sense debate full of de mag ogy and will simply invite everybody check the english romanian dictionary on line ( http : www . ec taco . co . uk english - romanian - dictionary ) . please type in \" swamp \" . the translation is mla tin , balt , sm rc . moldopodo let 's take a look at [ external link : dex ] , the official romanian - language dictionary . dex defines balt as : . n tin dere de ap st t to are , de ob ic ei nu pre a ad nc , av nd o vegeta ie i o fau n ac va tic specific ; zon de lun c in und abil , cu loc uri n care stag ne az apa ; p . ext . lac . ap de plo ai e ad un at n tr - o ad n ci tur ; gro ap cu ap sau mo cir l ; ( prin ex ag er are ) can tit ate mare de li chi d v r sat pe jos ; b l to ac . stretch of still water , usually not too deep , having a specific kind of aquatic vegetation and fauna ; forest zone prone to flooding , with places where water stag n ates ; by extension , a lake . rain water gathered into a ditch ; hole containing water or muck ; ( by exaggeration ) a great quantity of water spilled on the ground ; puddle . make of this what you will . : swamp is more or less bal ta . see for example [ wiki link : bal ta i al omi ei ] in romania . . moldavian language vs romanian language this is a politically motivated scandal that goes on for years . its trace on wikipedia is in fact smaller that the real scandal , which is very ugly . in short , the moldavian law uses three terms for the language : * moldavian , with the existence of a mol do - romanian identity unity ( language law of ) * romanian ( declaration of independence ) * moldavian ( constitution ) the origin lies in the stalin 's decision in to introduce the term moldavian language . it was to help him gain bessarabia , which then was part of romania . this decision was practically implemented in , when the area was occupied by the soviet military . during the soviet time , the usage of the word romanian language was equivalent to extremist nationalism , while the usage of the word romanian was qualified by the authorities as fascism ( there were people that were condemned for years of labour in siberia for \" fascism \" for answering to the judge \" i am romanian \" ) . as a result , when the soviet system fell , people were afraid to use it . a more neutral formulation \" limba de stat \" ( \" state language \" or \" official language \" ) was and still is largely used . by , the fear of \" romanian \" has past . in , a political setback has occured , and the word \" moldavian language \" was introduced in the constitution . since then , the issue of content has been that many people , countries , also eu , object to the usage of a term invented by stalin 's request and a pro val . the term \" romanian language \" is currently widely used , including in all the education system of moldova ( all manuals are called romanian language ) . a more neutral \" the official language of moldova \" is used in delicate situations . the problem for our article is that moldopodo did not introduce the term moldavian language until his last edits : he accepted the standard international ter min ol ory ( romanian language ) before , and only after the disagreements of op pin ions have occured on other issues , he introduced these changes . this is a sign of increased demands and increased agre ssi veness when there are cont ra di tions . it is not something specific to moldopodo only . it is the traditional soviet way of negotiating : they tell you x . if you do n't accept it , they demand x y . they add y as a revenge that you de ared contradict them . i can also add other demands that i think ought to be discussed , but because there are many issues in discussion here , i limited to the essential ones . we can discuss other issues later , when there is a history of mutual col ab or ation , it would be easier to frankly and openly talk then . and i am prepared to wait ( even forever if necessary ) and not introduce these other demands unless discussing them beforehand , and receiving agreement . but i am not introducing them now , because i want a civilized concensus , not an eternal edit war . on the same tok ken , i object to the increased demands , a policy of \" revenge \" used for agressive \" nego ci ations \" . * additionally : to illythr : i meant to say on stalin 's request and by his a pro val . sorry , i corrected my slef . how about we use \" moldavian romanian \" consistently on wikipedia ? politically , the issue will still go on for years , and it is a pit ty to come back to it again and again on wp . to moldopodo : please read , the language law , and the declaration independence , where it is written black on white that romanian is the official language of moldova . : * one word of stalin was law . a whole sentence - a code . ) you are right illythr about early s , and then reversal . * again , stalin himself did n't invent or even introduce it . as for usage - i think that administrative issues should use \" moldovan \" and linguistic ones - \" romanian \" . * : actually , stalin requested the change of moldovan alphabet to latin in the early s . this development was later reversed , but i have no info on whether stalin had any active personal involvement there , or just gave the go ahead to initiatives of local ap par at chi ks . * disagree . again too much de mag ogy , what does soviet negation have to do with this , x , y , z , what 's next ? however , the encyclopedia facts are simple . please check all valid moldavian legislation and find at least one word \" romanian \" . off cially the language is called moldavian . ( see constitution of moldova , article , available on internet ) moldopodo * call it moldovan and link it to the wiki article . the dispute is fully explained there . . erasing the names of city neighborhoods some city neighborhoods bear the names of the former th century suburbs : p m n ten i , slo bo z ia , mo lo do vo , b l ul nou , po dul chi in ului ; some are known by their [ wiki link : soviet ] - era names : th district , th district ; or other names : auto gara ( which means the inter - city coach station ) , dacia or colloquially called bam . vs some city neighborhoods bear the names of the former th century suburbs ; some are known by their [ wiki link : soviet ] - era names : th district , th district ; or other names : bam . this is another issue introduced as [ external link : increased de main d , as revenge ] . moldopodo has erased the names of the city neighbor ho ds , because they are not of russian origin . only one name , bam , which is on russian origin was left . this is defined in dictionaries as sho vin ism . * additionally : to illythr : why not ? there are districts with , inhabitants , while we have separate articles for localities . i do n't say a separate article , on the contrary . but what is wrong with giving the names of the districts ? all developed wikipedia articles of cities do so . to moldopodo : russian is not the official language in the city . by the way , you even misspelled some names in russian . : * is that piece of info ( any of the district names ) really all that useful ? * dis agre with dc , this is just another vandalism by dc on this article - this info is certainly useful as it explains the city 's structure , as well a shows what was the positive impact of ussr on b l i , as a good part of these dist c ri cts did not even exist before . please , do not pay attention to cha u vin isme accusations of dc , it 's a simple lie to cover dc 's cha u vin isme systematically erasing russian names of the districts . here is what was initially edited , both in moldavian and russian , deleted later by dc : some city neighborhoods bear the names of the former th century suburbs ( [ wiki link : romanian language romanian ] [ wiki link : russian language russian ] ) respectively ) : p m n ten i , slo bo z ia , mo lo do vo , b l ul nou , po dul chi in ului ; some are known by their [ wiki link : soviet ] - era names : th district , th district ; or other names : auto gara ( which means the inter - city coach station ) , dacia or colloquially called bam ( this completely new district was rapidly built during the soviet times on the un populated before territory ) , as referred to [ wiki link : bai kal am ur mainline ] - which name is colloquially preferred to the official [ wiki link : dacia ] , as referred to the land of the [ wiki link : daci ] . moldopodo : probably we should go with the romanization of cyrillic when the moldovan and russian names are different . readers of en wiki will most likely ignore info written in cyrillic . . erasing more than of the items from the history section moldopodo has cleared the history sections of all items were russian or soviet army were not pr ased . he has not done such changes for month . but he has introduced them on october [ external link : as increased de main d , and revenge ] that i de ared contradict them in other places . man tion of entire chapters of the history fo the city ( - , - ) were erased as a revenge . here are the passages he erased : the local population ( most of the battles would take place in the south of moldavia but occasionally also throughout the rest of the territory ) had to support alternatively the bur dens of three invading armies [ turkish , austrian , russian ] , none of which were friendly to the locals , regarding them with suspicion , not always un motivated . instead of growing at a fast rate as it was a century earlier , the population decreased by during this time . the [ wiki link : treaty of bucharest , peace of bucharest ] grants the whole eastern half of the [ wiki link : principality of moldavia ] , a territory named since than bas arabia ( or [ wiki link : bessarabia ] ) , and which coincides to a substantial extent to the territory of the modern [ wiki link : republic of moldova ] , to the russian empire . - the russians allow substantial economic and cultural freedom to moldavians romanians , wanting to secure the new province ( gu ber nia in russian ) . after the policy gradually wor ses . the number of counties of bessarabia is reduced from to , but ia i county is preserved . s education in [ wiki link : romanian language romanian ] is gradually banned , and the nobility is forced to use russian , inter marry russians , or leave to [ wiki link : romania ] . however , the policy has a rather contrary effect , due to the absence of assimilation through education by the russian authorities , be ss arabians strengthen cultural links with the rest of the romanians . september - november at the dissolution of the [ wiki link : russian empire ] , bessarabia elects a national council ( [ wiki link : s f atu l ri i ] ) , which proclaims the [ wiki link : moldavian democratic republic ] . april [ wiki link : s f atu l ri i ] votes union of [ wiki link : bessarabia ] with [ wiki link : romania ] [ wiki link : june ] , [ wiki link : ] in accordance with the [ wiki link : molotov - rib ben trop pact ] , the soviet union [ wiki link : june soviet ultimatum demands ] romania to cede [ wiki link : bessarabia ] and , shortly thereafter , the red army enters the region . surprisingly to the locals , the romanian authorities , in great limbo due to recent international developments ( conquest of [ wiki link : france ] by [ wiki link : germany ] four days before the soviet ultimatum ) , decides to temporarily avoid an armed conflict . the army and administration are withdrawn within hours , as required by the ussr , giving up all defensive installations in the area that were built for the sole even tu ality of a soviet aggression .

this has nothing to do with revenge . your analysis is so strange and ill - minded . moldopodo \" rep at ri ation \" many ethnic russians and ethnic ukrainians , prompted by the poor economic situation , have rep at ri ated to russia , resp . ukraine . vs many ethnic russians , ethnic ukrainians and ethnic romanians , prompted by the poor economic situation of moldova , have rep at ri ated to russia , ukraine and romania . again , in dro duc ed as revenge . the people that lef the city and went to russia and ukraine had to renounce the moldovan citizenship and claim return to those countries for ethnic belonging reason . that was the rec u ire ment of those countries . there are others who got those citizen ships and did not leave , those still live in the city , they have not rep at ri ated . in the entire moldova there were only ( ! ) cases of people that received romanian citizenship and renounced the moldovan one . i do n't know of a single one of them to be from balti . there are , i guess , a couple thousand inhabitants of the city ( , people in the entire moldova , and the city is . of the population of the country ) that have romanian citizenship , but they live in the city , and have moldovan citizenship . they never left . what kind of rep at ri ation , to where ? moldova , not romania is there home . aqu iring romanian citizenship does not mean to \" rep at ri ate \" anywhere . * disagree with dc - any proof , source , link ? i know plenty of moldavians who received romanian citizenship and left for romania for good , from b l i namely , because they identified themselves with romanians and romania , just as some russians and ukrainians did . now , is that an info to be put on an encyclopedia ? also it is just another false statement by dc that people had to renounce moldavian citizenship to go to ukraine or russia . people who left for russ sia and ukraine had for home moldova as well , they were born in moldova , but had to flee in front of people like dc , outright national sts , trying to assimilate everything to romanian and to rewrite the history on the expense of people 's lives . moldopodo . erasing that there were doubts about the accuracy of census from now on , this is old stuff , not as revenge . n . b . the accuracy of the census data was questioned by international observers , as the census officials , possibly motivated by financial short ages or political considerations , often filled in approximate figures , based on police data , rather than questioning large portions of population . however , the trends , proportions , phenomena put into evidence by the census data were not questioned , as the filling in was mainly due to economic situation . this is a necessary information imho . expressing the same with different words is ok . note , it is about accuracy not correctness . * disagree with dc - this article is about b l i with the statistical data submitted by state administration . if you have a link , verifiable source that questions this census write an article on this census and put it in there . such comments have no place on the article about b l i proper . moldopodo . estimations according to the romanian official estimations for , based on the census of , the city had around , people . was erased by moldopodo . * do n't see the need to delete it . * disagree with dc - we need a link and a verifiable source here . moldopodo . . in , another romanian census was carried out , however its data was not processed because of the [ wiki link : soviet occupation of bessarabia and northern bu ko vina soviet occupation ] . preliminary data suggested cca , inhabitants . v sin another romanian census was carried out , however its data was never processed because of the beginning of the [ wiki link : world war ii ] the military action of wwii started in the region on june . the wwii in the world has started on september . the census was taken \" as on january \" . start od wwii in poland was not a hinder . the data was not finished to be processed because on june soviet tr ou ps have entered . the word \" occupation \" is used because that is the title of a specific wikipedia article about the events . * disagree with dc - we need a link and a verifiable source here ( on this census , its date and other important details ) . anyway , that 's the version that was on russian wikipedia , which i find much more neutral and positive as an article . moldopodo . ethnic composition according to census i understand that it was cl asi fied and crime to write that information during the soviet period . but what is wrong of writing it now ? * disagree with dc - we need a link and a verifiable source here . moldopodo . moldovans romanians as ethnic group this is perhaps the most delicate of the whole issues , maybe we need a separate discussion for it . first , please note that the census data show that there is a completely different ci tu ation about the name of the language . cca of those that declared themselves moldavians declared romanian as their native language . second , please note these numbers are very fl uc tu ant from one census to another . it is a psychological process of national emancipation ( remeber that calling oneself romanian during the soviet time was equivalent to saying \" i am fascist \" , and it takes people years to overcome that fear . ) you can agree or disagree with the right ousness of this process of emancipation , but you can not deny it is happening . there are two questions here : a ) do we say ethnic moldavians , ethnic romanians , or ethnic moldavians romanians . i believe the second is correct . but because of political vo la tility of this issue , i would definitively agree to use third . b ) we should not divide the community into moldavians and romanians , because the majority of those that consider themselves moldavians also consider themselves romanians : they consider the nothin moldavian to be part of a larger notion romanian . like bavarian or austrian within german . also , they consider themselves as a whole community . even the few politicians that support mol do ven ism claim that the community is entire and never devi ded . all they oppose is the emancipation transformation that oc cu res . therefore , i am supporting to write mo ld av ains romanians and in the ethnic composition subsection to give the total number of the members of that community , but also to faithfully give the numbers of those that are declared recorded romanians and those that are declared recorded moldavians . otherwise , one artificially min im izes the true size of the community as proportion of the city population ( even if it is only by ) . * moldopodo , i insist , please do n't brake my argument above . it is not perfect , but leave it as it is , please . none can understand anything if you brake it in places . find time to write yours in full , or write it shorter and more inte li gently . thank you . * best simply stick to the actual census data . * disagree with dc . the above cited statement is false , also qualified as simple lie , reflecting only dc subjective point of view and has nothing to do with the reality that should be depicted in an encycloepdia . please , state your sources and links . moldopodo * disagree with dc . the above cited statement is false , also qualified as simple lie , reflecting only dc subjective point of view and has nothing to do with the reality that should be depicted in an encycloepdia . please , state your sources and links . moldopodo * disagree with dc . the above cited statement is false , also qualified as simple lie , reflecting only dc subjective point of view and has nothing to do with the reality that should be depicted in an encycloepdia . please , state your sources and links . moldopodo * disagree with dc . the above cited statement is false , also qualified as simple lie , reflecting only dc subjective point of view and has nothing to do with the reality that should be depicted in an encycloepdia . please , state your sources and links . moldopodo * disagree with dc . the above cited statement is false , also qualified as simple lie , reflecting only dc subjective point of view and has nothing to do with the reality that should be depicted in an encycloepdia . i do not see two or even one question here . moldopodo * disagree with dc . the above cited statement is false , also qualified as simple lie , reflecting only dc subjective point of view and has nothing to do with the reality that should be depicted in an encycloepdia . german speaking austrians and german speaking swiss , as well as german speaking belgian or german speaking lich ten ste inians do not consider themselves germans . moldopodo * disagree with dc . the above cited statement is false , also qualified as simple lie , reflecting only dc subjective point of view and has nothing to do with the reality that should be depicted in an encycloepdia . please , state your sources and links . who are the politicians ?

      "discussions that are continuing pomfret street historic district * [ wiki link : pomfret street historic district ] ( some previous discussion at [ wiki link : talk : connecticut route ] , [ wiki link : talk : pomfret , connecticut ] ) currently a redirect to a section for this hd within [ wiki link : pomfret , connecticut ] article . i previously stated i would be okay with that , but upon further thought i would prefer this to be broken out into a separate article . the pomfret article can should link to this separate article . i think it 's better to start the historic district article , which will cover only a portion of pomfret . among other things , this would provide for its talk page to have a reqphoto for the historic district . i requested the nrhp application for this district a long time ago but have not received it . : a picture of the historic district would be the same as a picture of the town center . as i said , this is a town center historic district and is better treated as integrated with the town . it just makes for a better narrative . : i 'm not too sure , but is n't pomfret , like other ct towns , a large town encompassing several villages hamlets ? also i would prefer to develop the hd article separately so that it can list contributing properties . historic district articles can be developed well to attract photos and describe historic , contributing properties , if allowed to be separate . for models , see any of several historic district articles by such as [ wiki link : new bedford historic district ] and [ wiki link : central troy historic district ] . i asked for but have not received a copy of the nrhp application document which would provide basis for a large expansion this way . it is fine for the pomfret town article to describe the historic district too , but i do not agree that redirecting the hd to the town is best even now , and with more material the separation will be necessary , so i do n't think it is fair to insist that the hd article can not exist . : umm , that 's true of all towns ( even cities ) . it 's just that in more urban areas villages are more known as neighborhoods or sections . when it does come to a point that the description of the town center has sufficient distinctive content that makes it too big for the town article , then we can think about splitting it . as currently written , there is only boiler - plate content in the pomfret article . : i have explained some other reasons , in other discussion sections , why having split out hd articles created upfront , and kept , helps in some ways . it is fine for you to have a different subjective opinion about what is best , though . i wonder , though , do you have a source you have not shared on the pomfret nrhp district ? you speak very confidently that \" a picture of the historic district would be the same as a picture of the town center \" , where i do n't see information supporting that in the pomfret , connecticut article . in fact , the article asserts \" pomfret has no formal town center \" ! before it later asserts \" the main town center is listed as a historic district on the u . s . national register of historic places . \" i would like to see some evidence of what is the town center , hopefully in a map that could be used to create a map for the article . : pomfret actually two centers . one was the original settlement and the other was several miles away that developed as a result of the railroad . in modern times , these two have essentially merged and is now the densely settled part of town . the nrhp district encompasses the areas surrounding the main highway connecting the two traditional centers . what kind of information should a map show that would indicate a locality is the town center ? : for a map to document what is the village , what would be most relevant would be a map that showed the village and labelled its town center . for reference in interpreting a map of the historic district , which is obtainable . i do n't know if your access to lists of polygon corner points is sufficient to enable you to actually make a map of this or any other district , without also having an actual map to work from . : it happens that today the national register sent me the nrhp application document for pomfret street historic district , which i had requested more than a month ago , but the request was lost apparently , and the application was sent in response to my followup . indeed , it includes a map of the district , it lists the contributing structures in the district , it includes plenty of material to write an article about the district which would be fine as a wikipedia article , but in my judgment too detailed for the pomfret , connecticut town article . the map is reasonably complex , with well more than polygon corners . if you just had the list of those points , and you guessed at connecting the dots , i think you would not get it exactly right , but you would not be too far off , because the shape is not as irregular as it could have turned out to be . : i would like to proceed now by splitting out the [ wiki link : pomfret street historic district ] article , and developing it over time . would anyone object ? the only other possibilities i can imagine would be for someone else to insist that i must develop the article in a sandbox and then pass through some review process before i should be allowed to recreate the article . or to insist that i develop the material within the currently short section of the pomfret article before i should be allowed to split it out . i would not want to do that as i prefer to work with some messy material at first , suited for an \" under construction \" tag , and i can already see that it will not be proper to keep it all in the pomfret article . i assess that there is a lack of consensus for any extraordinary review process , and that it is correct for me to just restore the separate hd article . i 'll pause for comments i guess . there is no map that explicitly says \" town center \" . so that means nothing will probably convince you that a specific area of the town is the town center . it 's usually easy because you will find several things in a town center : the town hall , the library , the green , the con gre gational church , and a town historical marker describing the history of the town - but i guess that 's not good enough for you . the only thing that might not fit in the town article for a town center district would be an ex pic it listing of properties and their details . but go ahead and give it a try and see what you get . goshen historic district , and west g h s [ wiki link : goshen historic district ] and [ wiki link : west goshen historic district ] were redirects to [ wiki link : goshen , connecticut ] . i have just made the first into a disambiguation page and created nrhp stub articles for the nd plus for [ wiki link : goshen historic district ( goshen , connecticut ) ] . i would prefer for these to be kept as separate articles rather than merged into the goshen town article , so they can be expanded to list their contributing properties , etc . the town article , which currently does not mention them , could should be revised to mention summarize from them . please discuss here . : the goshen one is the town center and is more appropriately discussed in the town article . west goshen is a well - known village of the town and should indeed be discussed in a separate article . ( outdent ) okay , i see that you deleted the separate article by merging material from it into the goshen article . i have just now reverted your redirection . as i have already indicated by my opening this discussion section , i believe there is merit in having the separate hd article started sooner , now , rather than later . i interpret your redirection in the face of my statements here already was a bold step ; i have now reverted that . this time , per [ wiki link : wikipedia : bold , revert , discuss cycle ] process , let us please discuss it rather than edit war . i set up this area to discuss this and related cases centrally , and let 's discuss here please . it is also your prerogative to open an afd on the article , but please do n't revert it to a redirect , prod it , or speedy - delete it , as i am legitimate contesting for the notability of this article . my reasons for creating and wanting to keep the separate article include : * ( ) it is part of building the wikipedia coverage of nrhp properties and districts in ct . the historic district is notable on its own , and there is extensive documentation available that would allow it to be grown to a size larger than can be reasonably kept in the town article . i do n't have the nrhp documentation in hand , but if it is like all other nrhp hd documentation , it will include a list of contributing properties and considerable detail . developing a historic district article with photos and sections on many of these properties is a reasonable goal . the article now , while short , is a legitimate wikipedia article already . * ( ) keeping it separate makes it available to me and others to add material and grow it , free from others ' legitimate editorial control over the goshen town article which would tend to fight against some details that are appropriate for the hd article but not the town article . * ( ) keeping it separate allows for a reqphoto to be included in the talk page of the hd article and for the photo request to show up in ct - wide reqphoto lists , in proper conjunction with coordinates that are in the article . if the reqphoto is just left in a talk page for a redirect , the coordinates are disconnected , and map - based views of photos needed in connecticut will not show this district . if the reqphoto is put into the goshen article , it will not naturally and clearly call for photos of the historic district , and or it will compete unnecessarily with other goshen photos needed . the most efficient and direct way to call for photos is by reqphoto in the talk page of the separate hd article . * ( ) keeping it separate keeps the disambiguation page [ wiki link : goshen historic district ] in compliance with [ wiki link : wp : mosdab ] style guidelines policy . by guideline policy , disambiguation pages are supposed to include only links to actual wikipedia articles ( with exception under [ wiki link : mos : dab rl ] for certain articles that are redlinks and will be created ) , and they are supposed to show the actual article names without hiding article locations by pipe links or redirects . in the current disambiguation page , [ wiki link : goshen historic district ( goshen , connecticut ) ] is properly shown . if the article is redirected , then the disambiguation page could perhaps be updated to show a link to the town article instead , with explanation that there is a goshen historic district included in the town . however , this causes unnecessary work now which would only have to be reversed later when the hd article is re - separated . i would strongly prefer to complete the nrhp disambiguation nation - wide once , in intended - to - be - final form , rather than set up future work . * ( ) i want to avoid future disputes about when the hd article is sufficiently developed to stand on its own . i do n't want to personalize this unduly , but there has been repeated tension between myself and about nrhp places in ct , and i think occasionally also between polaron and others . polaron , in june apparently , went through and made numerous hd and other links in the ct nrhp list - articles into redirects to towns . since then , polaron has repeatedly taken a position that separate nrhp articles should not yet be allowed and has been overriding my own efforts to begin to develop articles . often in the course of my developing nrhp disambiguation pages nation - wide , i have created stub articles for ct nrhp districts to support disambiguation pages . my experience in - ct cases has been that polaron notices these and immediately reacts to eliminate them . in most of these cases , when i start there is no mention of the nrhp in the town article to which a redirect points . for example , there was no mention of goshen historic district in the [ external link : goshen article 's then - current version ] . i do n't think anyone can argue that it is unreasonable for me to replace the redirect with a stub article that includes the nrhp infobox and a couple sentences . polaron has intervened to eliminate the stub articles , which is , i believe , unnecessarily negative . although i expect hope polaron does not mean it , i personally experience it as unfriendly and controlling , and i project that other would - be editors of ct nrhp articles can also experience it in that way . in the process , polaron has built material content in various ct town and cdp articles , which is fine and good . however , that material could be added to the town articles anyhow , and a whole lot of repeated dispute could be avoided , if the separate nrhp articles are allowed to exist from the get - go . i would prefer not to set up standards and argue them , about when a hd article should be allowed to be separate and when it should not , and to have to repeatedly request the intervention of other editors to judge and so on . i would prefer not to set up a special tribunal for all these cases , etc . on the other hand , polaron , i do n't see your authority for asserting that the goshen historic district \" is more appropriately discussed in the town article \" . you are certainly free to mention the historic district in the town article , and use available information about it to enhance the town article , but that does not preclude growing a different article for the wikipedia - notable nrhp - listed historic district . in the town article , the emphasis has to be different . actually i would argue that the assertion now in the town article that \" the town center was listed as a historic district on the national register of historic places in \" is even a little bit suspect , is not perfectly well supported . this is not a major complaint , and i would not strike it from the town article being worked on by a local wikipedian , and i would not bother to put a citation needed tag on it . but in fact there is no source given that the historic district is the town center . in other cases it is more true , but even here i think it is somewhat the case , that shoe hor ning the ct hd material into the town article and revising the town article to assert it is the proper place , is a bit argumentative . the ar gu men ta tiveness is reflected in awkward writing in the town article which detracts from the town article . instead of two , mutually supporting , perfectly well referenced wikipedia articles , you get instead one article with questionable assertions . i do want to acknowledge there is subjectivity in judgment of whether , at the present time , it is better for wikipedia articles to have a short stub ct hd article separate from a town article that may be adapted to cover the limited material that is at first available . polaron is entitled to have a different opinion about what looks best for wikipedia readers currently . however , i believe that it is better for the development of wikipedia to allow the stub articles to start and to be grown , and in this goshen historic district article case i argue , for all of the reasons above , to keep the separate article . if you do n't like the current stub article , then [ wiki link : wp : sofixit ] please by obtaining the nrhp nomination documents and other materials , and develop it further so that it meets your personal criteria for being a good standalone article . and , also , i would like the opportunity to just work ahead on developing this and other nrhp articles . : again , the historic district is the town center . what makes you believe it is n't ? where is the town green ? where is the central post office ? where are town offices ? where is the library ? where is the congregation church ? whatever made the historic district significant is a result of the history of the town . it 's not that i do n't like the stub article but there is nothing about the historic district that does n't apply to the town center . : if you are do n't dislike the stub article , then we have no problem , but your adding a merger proposal to the stub just now suggests you do n't like it . i 'm confused , what do you want ? to discuss the boundaries of the town center and the boundaries of the historic district requires time and research and maps . it is premature to argue that the town center and the historic district are so in ex tri cable that they can not be discussed in separate wikipedia articles , and there is no town center article , anyhow . your merger proposal is to merge the hd with the town - wide article . also , you do not have sources and maps to make a supported assertion in mainspace that the town center and the historic district are the same . i do n't disagree with your intuition that it is quite possible that the boundaries of the town center may substantially be the same as the hd . ( or , do you actually have sources that you can share that show the town center on a map , and or which show the historic district on a map ? ) but please see reasons , above about why i wish to keep the hd article separate . : i do n't dislike stub articles as a general rule . but in this particular case , the town center is better described in the town article . the histories are identical . : i 've been meaning to say , in this and other cases , there is a difference between the nrhp historic district vs . a town center , in that the nrhp historic district is a modern , current thing . it usually contains some elements that are > years old , but it consists of only what is currently present . an article about an hd has to focus on what is still present , although it can mention prior history . also , historic districts are usually irregular shapes which include par cel s that have old buildings , while often skipping newer intrusions . from my experience seeing hd maps elsewhere , they often are sort of random in appearance , sometimes from the fact that owners of properties may be allowed to opt in or out from being included in the district . a village or town center for a ct town has a longer history , so an article about it is not focussed about the same history . and village or town clearly includes modern intrusions such as strip malls and - s which the historic district hopefully avoids . so , i disagree , the histories are not identical , and nor are the current physical contents . : of course the boundaries are not exactly the same but that does n't mean we should discuss them as separate articles . it just makes more sense to have a unified historical narrative . try expanding one and see if you find something that does n't apply to the history of the town . also , there are no strip malls in goshen center and this particular historic district is significant for late th century architecture , which is when the town developed . : i have stated several reasons why it makes sense , from the general perspective of building the wikipedia , to have a separate article sooner rather han later . and i am trying , albeit slowly , to build these . i am ham strung by lack of ready access to nrhp documents . here also you speak as if with confidence about what are the historic district boundaries . can you provide a map of the hd boundaries here , too ; that would be extremely relevant to add to this dicussion . southport historic district in the course of disambiguation work on north carolina nrhp articles , i find it necessary to create [ wiki link : southport historic district ] disambiguation . it links naturally to [ wiki link : southport historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] , which turns out to be a redirect set up in to link to [ wiki link : southport ( fairfield ) ] . currently the southport town article shows a map of the town within ct that is far larger than what i imagine is the historic district . the town article does not explicitly name or integrate discussion of the southport hd . its lede is : \" southport is a distinct section of the town of fairfield , connecticut . settled in , it has been designated as a historic district because of its harbor , churches , public buildings , and the home ste ads of some of the first families in the area . \" actually i expect that statement is inaccurate : i do not believe that the town as a whole has been designated as a historic district , or that it is even close . currently i do n't have a lot of info on the historic district , but i know it is notable on its own and that it merits an article . neither article is well enough developed , actually , for a reader to know the boundaries of either , and it is not possible to judge the overlap ; it is just my belief based on experience with other town and nrhp historic district pair ings that there will be significant differences here . i choose to proceed to build structure by creating the ct nrhp hd article as a good short stub article with its implicit call for expansion . : polaron redirected the article i created , which i experience as somewhat unfriendly , and i have reverted polaron 's edit . please discuss here . the reasons , which i gave for another case , above , probably all apply . : there is no need for duplication . the village article is a perfect vessel to describe the historic district . : again , why do you need two separate articles discussing the same thing ? : ( i re ordered and rein den ted the sequence of comments above in the order they were posted . ) : to others , there is some confusion here , because i relied upon the existing southport article to assess that southport was a huge area ( i was misled by an un labelled map in the article ) . and polaron has revised the southport article now to make it look largely the same as the hd article . what i did was fine . polaron , it seems to me that you are taking work from nrhp articles to improve corresponding village town cdp articles , which is fine and good . however , you do not have to tear out the contribution of another editor ( me ) in the process . also , your removal of the separate page puts other structure in wikipedia out of wack , namely the disambiguation page . are you intending to fix that ? i do n't really believe this would be the case , but are you trying to claim credit for yourself in some way ? i read what you write here , and i get that you do n't like the separate hd article . would you please do me the favor of reading what i write . note i have stated legitimate reasons , which you have not addressed . i may not be able to watch this and discuss here for much more today , but i will return and respond later . sincerely , : all your reasons do not require a separate village and historic district article . your entire contribution is still in the village article . i have torn nothing out . : polaron , it is clearly edit warring for you to again , just now , to remove the article which i had created . please stop that . i have been trying to edit constructively in that article , in the southport article ( where you also reverted my work ) , in the talk page of the southport article , and here . i think i have been friendly and respectful enough of your views , but i experience what you are doing now as being [ wiki link : wp : disruptive ] in a bad way . i will return the southport historic district article to how i developed it , and i ask you not to delete it again . : it 's not being deleted . clearly you have n't been listening to me . whatever you can say about the district applies to the village . also , it takes two parties to edit war . ( outdent ) as an objective outsider here , i agree with polaron on this one . we do n't need two very short stubby two - sentence articles ( which you , doncram , are known for creating ) when we can combine the two using redirects . what \" other structure \" are you talking about , doncram , that this throws out of whack ? if you 're talking about the [ wiki link : southport historic district ] dab page , what 's wrong with it ? are you concerned that the two links on the page are n't going to look the same because one will have a city , state dab and the other wo n't ? well frankly , dab pages do n't have to be uniform ; they just have to disambiguate . linking to the town page instead of the district page wo n't throw anything out of whack . : i am entirely proud of having created thousands of stub nrhp articles in wikipedia , which for example helped build some perfectly good coverage of every u . s . national historic landmark . thousands of the articles that i started as stubs have been further improved by myself and by many others . i continue to create stub articles where helpful and necessary for supporting the disambiguation of nrhps nation - wide , so that a ) readers will be more able to find nrhp places they look for , and b ) more importantly so that editors creating nrhp articles , anywhere , will be able to start them confidently at a permanently feasible names to hold them , within the structure of a comprehensive system of list - articles and dis am bi gation pages that is almost completely set up now . it is not meant or maintained as a rigid system ; please note that i am very supportive of redirecting from initial nrhp names to existing or new articles about lighthouses and many other kinds of topics where it is established that the nrhp place is essentially the same as a place going by a different common name . i also make it a point to create stub nrhp articles to capture semi - complicated bits of information , like boundary increase situations or like nris error situations , so that editors will not have to struggle in the absence of clear information , later . : but dude man fel lab ra , you understand what is going on here entirely wrong if you think that i want for there to be two very short stubby two - sentence articles . do you think what i did in [ wiki link : list of rh ps in ms ] , where i am sure i created numerous stub articles , or anywhere else , is bad work ? i certainly want for the ct historic district articles to be developed . and , in many cases that can and will eventually involve merger with a village , cdp , town or other community article . however , i object to merging them without having adequate information to know what is the historic district and what is the village . it happens that in ct we do not have online copies of nrhp documents which would help a lot . : in my experience with polaron , he has edit warred to merge hds with town articles about large towns having multiple village areas , where it almost certainly will not make sense to keep the hd article merged in , where in fact it will make sense to re split them out if they have been merged . in some other cases i have concurred with mergers . but in too many cases for me to ignore , polaron has argued by edit warring , by overriding my work , rather than by discussing and by adding sources that bring new information out into common knowledge . here , in the [ wiki link : southport ( fairfield ) ] article , for example , he has added in assertions that may well be correct but are without sources . note that some editor tagged the southport article with \" unreferenced \" . the sources now in the article include the generic nris reference which does not speak to overlap at all , and other sources that seem to support minor points , such as some actor 's association with the community . at this point , i do n't care to have my work ripped out in favor of an unreferenced article , by polaron 's subjective decision . and it is not established to my satisfaction , anyhow , that eventually good wikipedia coverage of southport hd and the southport village will not best be as separate articles . so i do n't now concur with the structure change that polaron has edit warred towards implementing . i would prefer for both the town and hd articles to be kept open and to be developed with sources . if there are two articles for now , then it certainly would make sense for the village article to wikilink to the hd article , and for it not to carry highly overlapping information . i contributed to the village article , but polaron reverted some of my edits , and i am not going to edit war on the village article to bring it into complementary , reader - appropriate status . currently , i agree that the situation for these two articles looks bad to wikipedia readers . however it could be remedied for now by reducing the unsupported statements in the village article and editing it to coordinate with the hd article . : i do n't currently know whether southport village vs . southport hd overlap is substantial enough to merit merger eventually . i do stand by the wikipedia - notability of the hd article that i created , and assert it was an advance for wikipedia for me to create it separately from the southport village article at its then - current state . the southport article then suggested , apparently incorrectly , by its inclusion of a misleading map , that it was a much larger area . at this point , i object to merging the hd article in without better information on the overlap , in part because the merger would invalidate some structure that i created . yes , merely the disambiguation page which indeed could be revised . the disambiguation page is technically \" out of whack \" if it points to [ wiki link : southport historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] , if there is not article at that name . i do n't want to over state that reason , i am just explaining it as one part of supporting structure which needs to be addressed when articles are moved to names not expected by the initially - nris - database - based naming system for nrhp places . i appreciate , dude man fel lab ra , that you at least asked about this contributing point . thanks ! : the official historic district is roughly the portion south of the railroad tracks ( the mixed zoning area of the neighborhood ) . in all cases where a historic district has the same name as a village neighborhood , you will find that the historic district is wholly contained in the village neighborhood . also , what edits to the southport article that i reverted were you talking about ? if it is the case that i did remove correct information , i will restore it . : thanks for commenting . by your statement about the location of the historic district , do you mean anything more than the location description text \" roughly bounded by southport harbor , rr , old south rd . and rose hill rd . \" from the nris database ? if you have different information that about the hd , and about the village neighborhood , i hope that you would share it . i must disagree with your unqualified statement that \" in all cases . you will find that the historic district is wholly contained in the village neighborhood . \" that is too much of an over - generalization . : about what edits did you revert , those would be your repeated edits that redirected the article to the southport article . i am not finding it amusing that here and in other comments on this page you are playing with words to imply you have not been edit warring to delete separate articles about ct nrhp hds that i have created . : the actual southport historic district is triangular and is somewhat smaller than the listed description text . you said you \" contributed to the village article \" and that i \" reverted some of your edits \" . what is this referring to ? about edit warring , i believe you are too . : at this point , i do n't really care very much , but how do you know that about the triangular district . it is almost irrelevant that you \" know \" that , if you will not provide sources and show it for others to see . : in the southport talk page and its article , as you are fully aware , i discussed and took steps to replace a misleading map that was in the article . i am not checking now , but for the moment i believe that the replacement map which i added is still in the article . that would be the part not reverted . also , as you are fully aware , i edited the southport article to wikilink to the separate southport historic district article , and to remove the duplicative nrhp infobox which you had copied in from the separate southport hd article , and perhaps in other small ways i edited to make the southport article complementary to the separate hd article . those would be the contributing edits of mine that you reverted . i did not repeat those edits , i stated here that i was not doing that . : i replaced the map with a more accurate one based on the census tract boundary ( seems to be good enough at small scale ) . as for the other edits , that presupposes a separate article . with regard to the triangular shape of the district , that 's what the vertices of the polygon defining the district look like ( with the caveat that i may be ignoring some minor corrections in the utm to lat - long conversion ) . see the section somewhere above for more details . do you really believe that part of the historic district is outside the area commonly known as southport ? : fine , that establishes you have reverted all , not just some , of my edits there . i do n't know what to believe , honestly . i know the policy of wikipedia is to value sourced statements above unsourced ones , and i see no sources or evidence other than polaron 's say - so , that the district is within or the same as the village , which as far as i can tell has no available definition anywhere . : i 've restored the southport hd article again , although with revision to drop the sentence , which i admit was awkward , attempting to characterize a relationship between the hd and the village . so , the current article is factual and entirely sourced . i suggest it be kept as is , unless and until someone does the work of getting the nrhp application document or other sources and adding sourced statements that describe the relationship of the hd and the village . : doncram , let 's not forget that the main purpose of an encyclopedia is to convey information to people . at this time , a person interested in obtaining information about the southport historic district would get more useful value from [ wiki link : southport ( fairfield ) ] than from [ wiki link : southport historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] . it 's good that you have removed the sentence that i called \" embarrassing \" ( thank you ! ) , but in its absence the southport historic district article no longer even acknowledges the existence of the longer article about the southport section of fairfield . a separate hd article that does not even link back to the article that has information about the history of southport and images of its historic area fails to convey information to people instead , it separates them from information . you make some worthwhile points regarding the need for additional sourcing in the southport article , but you are not helping the situation . your insistence on splitting the articles is the kind of distraction that gets in the way of making useful improvement 's to an article 's information quality . : i have trouble believing that there will ever be sufficient content to justify two separate articles about this place , but please let 's not create a separate hd article until it has significantly more content than can be provided in an infobox , and please do n't delink the two articles . : i think it undermines the discussion process here for the separate hd article to be deleted . as a matter of process , should n't the discussion be continued here until some kind of consensus is reached ? it is illogical , i think , to halt the development of the hd article towards satisfying your concerns ( for example , how it should link to the separate southport article ) , and otherwise . i want to develop the article , focusing on what can be said supported by inline citations only . that is a different focus editorial style than the style of the various ct town and other community articles , including the southport article , which includes some unsourced statements among its sourced ones . : i am willing to abide by a consensus decision about a merger , a discussion process which i started here , but that has not been reached . it seems inappropriate for polaron and now for you , orlady , to halt the development of the hd article , which thereby appears to \" win \" the discussion decision about whether the hd article can be allowed to be separate and be developed . orlady , i appreciate that you are participating here and actually asking me to abide by your preference here . however , i do n't see what is different , why you should not abide by my reciprocal request to you to keep the article ( and allow it to be developed ) while discussion is ongoing here . in terms of di str actions , i perceive it to be the repeated deletion of the draft hd article , that is \" the kind of distraction that gets in the way of making useful improvement 's to an article 's information quality . \" i mean no disrespect , but i am restoring the article now ; please do n't redirect it . : obviously we disagree . i think it should be possible to have some third party come in and make a closing judgement that we can all agree to live with , as in closing of afd processes , about whether a stub hd article can be allowed to exist and develop . in afd processes , participants are prohibited from blanking the article while the process is underway . could we all please agree to consider this discussion here an afd - like process . or , please suggest some other process . perhaps this discussion here should in fact be replaced by an afd , because we all ( me included ) do not seem to know how to run a decision process here that meets with sufficient agreement . : i am trumped by orlady 's protecting the page , so i can not restore it . i do n't disagree with orlady 's intent expressed in her edit summary \" short - term protection to cool off the pointless edit warring over this page \" , but i respectfully think that is the wrong default . the page should be restored and i and others should be allowed to develop it , while the afd - type discussion here , or a formal afd goes on . : would you have preferred to be blocked for edit - warring ? ( i do n't think so . i thought it would be far better to stop the revert war by protecting the article for a little while . ) : i agree that your decision to protect the article for a time was helpful . it allowed time , for example , for dude man fel lab ra to comment below , challenging me to refine and or clarify my position to you and others . thank you . there is nothing that has been deleted . all the content is in the village article . if you want to completely rewrite the southport article to the style you like , you are free to do so . go ahead and put new content in the village article - no one is stopping you from adding content . my only concern is that there should be one unified article describing the topic of southport in connecticut . : so , in order for doncram , or me , or anyone to write about the southport historic district , we would only be allowed to do so in the confines of a poorly sourced article about the town ? would you support stripping all unsourced statements out of the article , so that we would be contributing to a properly sourced article ? your statement that \" no one is stopping you from adding content \" is misleading , since doncram is clearly being stopped from adding content in the way his process does it , by creating a separate , well - sourced article for a subset of information as opposed to including it in an otherwise poorly sourced article . i would also prefer to contribute in a way that fit my expertise , as opposed to being forced to add good information to what i saw as a poor article that i did n't have the expertise or the desire to repair . i do n't think that you can separate the fact that the article is poorly sourced from the decision about where to build the properly sourced historic district information . : further , there does seem to be quite a bit of \" it 's true because i know it 's true \" coming from polaron , which seems to be in direct conflict with [ wiki link : wp : v wikipedia 's policy on verifiability ] and [ wiki link : wp : or the on original research ] . the discussion of which includes the statement \" unsourced material obtained from a wikipedian 's personal experience , such as an unpublished eyewitness account , should not be added to articles . it would violate both this policy and verifiability , and would cause wikipedia to become a primary source for that material . \" : unfortunately , the vast majority of place articles in connecticut are unsourced . if you have good reason to believe something in the article is false , i suppose you could delete it . if you want to remove all existing content in the village article that you believe to be likely false , go ahead . but to me , it is evident that people who are interested in expanding the southport historic district article are also the same ones interested in southport . even if that is not the case , since the histories are virtually identical , expansion of the historic district information automatically means expansion of the village article . historic districts based on colonial era villages and manufacturing villages are quite common here and locally there is no distinction between the historic district and the village identity . my point is go ahead and rewrite the village article to your liking . you can even write it as if it were the just the historic district . in the end , the story you get will be the same . : currently , the only content about the historic district is what 's in the infobox . the infobox ( plus a couple of sentences of text that contain the same information ) is in the southport article , where it is sup ple mented by other information ( some sourced , some not supported by references ) about southport 's history and current status . if the energy that has gone into turf - fighting about article ownership were instead directed at researching the topic , there might be enough information for a second article about the historic district . however , until someone obtains and writes up some additional content , there is barely enough content for one article about southport , much less two . : i agree with orlady . i think this should be handled in a [ wiki link : wp : summary style ] manner ( specifically look at [ wiki link : wikipedia : summary style avoiding unnecessary splits this section ] ) . keep the articles together for the time being , having the district as a section in the article . if at some point after much research has been done , the section begins to grow large enough to warrant its own article ( at least - good - sized paragraphs ) , it can be split out to [ wiki link : southport historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] and a short summary can be left behind on [ wiki link : southport ( fairfield ) ] , linking to the district 's article using the \" main article \" fashion . : thanks for referring to that section of the wp : summary style guideline . however , it states \" editors are cautioned to not immediately split articles if the new article would meet neither the general notability criterion nor the specific notability criteria for their topic . \" there is no doubt that the nrhp - listed hd is notable . it is clearly individually wikipedia - notable . so that guideline does not apply . : on the other hand , polaron writes at the southport talk page : \" southport is not actually well - defined as one would hope \" and goes on to suggest it could be mapped defined as a previous \" borough \" or as a census tract in the area . i expect there are other alternative versions of southport as well . it is not well - defined , and there is no fair reason that the focused , reliably - sourced historic district article , which i and others eventually would like to build can not be started . i think this is coming down to personal preferences or style differences , subjective , about whether a wikipedia - notable topic can be developed in mainspace . this is not basis for blocking development of wikipedia on this topic . : you can develop the district 's information inside the town 's article ; there 's nothing \" blocking you from developing it \" . as of now , a reader would benefit more if the articles were combined . it makes no sense to click on the district 's link if all he 's going to get is two sentences . in fact , that would probably be more of an annoyance to him . : from [ wiki link : wikipedia : merging ] : \" if a page is very short and is unlikely to be expanded within a reasonable amount of time , it often makes sense to merge it with a page on a broader topic . \" more times than not , these stub articles that you create for nrhp listings stay that way for months and even years . no one ever touches them . yes , someone may come along later and expand them , but that time frame is far from \" reasonable . \" : this is a personal story between doncram and me , but do you remember the historic districts in [ wiki link : meridian , mississippi ] ? i was working on expanding the section in the city 's article about the districts when you abruptly began creating the district stubs with - sentences ( which i later finished for uniformity because i 'm ocd haha ) . i attempted to expand them after you had created them , but there is simply not much information out there about them . it seems they will forever ( or at least for a long time ) be limited to this stub state . had you waited to create the stub articles until more research was done in the main city article , it probably would have become apparent that the individual articles were not needed . i do n't want the same thing to happen here . i would advise researching first and adding to southport 's town article before working on the district article . you may find that , like meridian 's districts , there is n't enough information to justify an entirely new article . ( in fact , i think i have an idea for those meridian articles that i will pursue right now ) : a big difference is that in meridian , you did good work in clearly identifying the historic districts from another source and from nrhp documents , and as i recall you learned to make maps for wikipedia , in making these ones . after information is developed , sure it can be appropriate to merge the material and there will often usually be easy consensus to do so . in the meridian case , i think i created those articles intending to be helpful , to place the nrhp infoboxes there , etc . , for you to possibly use . at the time i was providing you encouragement and advice and information on how to proceed and getting others to chime in with info on how to create maps , etc . , too . having separate articles on the nrhp hd districts was effectively a suggestion . if i did argue about keeping them separate then , which i do n't recall , at least i did not revert your edits and prevent you from working on what you wanted where you wanted to , in the meridian article . anyhow , if those stubs still exist , i expect they should be redirected to the nice sections of the meridian article that you created for each one . although i would also support you if you wanted to develop any of the hd ones further , and keep them separate . : here , there has been preemptive assertion that historic district articles can not be developed , and it is only one editor 's generally unsourced , educated guesses that a given hd must be the same as a given village , which he is enforcing by reverts and redirects . this is effectively making a contested afd decision with no due process . his guesses have been wrong in some cases where at first he edit warred , and it is not cooperative building , it is tearing down and insisting on his way or the highway , with no legitimate authority . also here the town village cdp articles are of vastly inferior quality to your meridian article ( which you really should nominate for fa , if you still have not ) . : there are many cases where creating the stub hd article has been helpful , allowing for facts such as area overlap to a village can be sorted out , maps and sources found , and so on , and then ultimately it may be decided easily by a regular merge proposal that the material can be merged . in some cases i have created hd articles and myself proposed merger , seeking input decision by locals who could assess the degree of area overlap . here in ct , there has been immediate edit warring to enforce arbitrary decisions by one judgmental editor , in the complete absence of public , common information about area overlaps . it is un bearable for me , as one would - be editor , for it to be pre - judged that i can not create a well - sourced article on a wikipedia - notable topic , and that i shall only be allowed to work in a section in some crum my town article that may or may not correspond closely to the hd area . question about edit warring and process what am i to do , with respect to polaron 's continued edit warring on the southport historic district and other articles ? i see now that he has again today reverted the southport hd article to redirect to the southport ( fairfield ) article . i have opened discussion here and invited others to comment , towards reaching a consensus decision . polaron initially redirected ( i think after i had already opened discussion here ) in [ external link : this first redirect ] , then repeated [ external link : in this diff ] , then [ external link : repeated today ] . since the topic is under discussion , i am experiencing this as [ wiki link : wp : disruptive ] . could an administrator comment about process here , please ? and , i am going to restore the hd article now . it undermines the discussion here to lose the article and i am personally experiencing polaron 's repeated edits as his trying to win an argument by edit warring , rather than developing and putting forward information towards creating a consensus . : i hit the rollback button , newly available to me , to implement that reversion . since i opened and continue in this discussion , i think that is okay , but if it was technically incorrect for me to use that button here then i apologize , and i would simply appreciate advice . : also glancing at polaron 's contributions i see just now that he has also [ external link : today edited ] to create [ wiki link : southport historic district ( connecticut ) ] as a competing similar name to redirect to his preferred target , trying to bypass the [ wiki link : southport historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] article ! i think this is disruptive and unhelpful ! : i see also that polaron has overridden , again , the [ wiki link : georgetown historic district ( georgetown , connecticut ) ] article , to redirect to his preferred target , by [ external link : this edit today ] . that in fact struck out the merger proposal request for discussion that had directed to here , properly . polaron 's previous edits to wipe out this article , all after discussion was clearly opened here , are [ external link : this reversion ] , and [ external link : this reversion ] . i am undoing polaron 's latest edit to wipe this out , now . there really should be a process for enforceable merges similar to afd . unless you somehow find content that applies to the historic district but not to the village , you have no basis for having two separate articles on the same thing . you can tell a better story by discussing the historic district in the village articles . you may have a better leg to stand on with respect to merging to the whole town article . but your inexplicable refusal to discuss the historic district in a village article is also disruptive . oh , and use of rollback to edit war is a definite no - no . : the process should be to discuss these ct nrhp cases here , to involve and get other editors ' consensus . and , unfortunately , to supplement that by requesting administrator intervention to stop your edit warring . i am discussing these issues in each case here and have not ruled out any topic for discussion . in the [ wiki link : southport historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] and other cases where i am drawing the line and reverting your deletions , i had created these articles , and you are one step ahead in any count of reversions . in the context of my opening discussion here , and seeking input from other editors , that is just preposterous to assert , as you have on this page and elsewhere , that we are somehow equally at fault in edit warring . what on earth can you mean that my \" inexplicable refusal \" to discuss anything is disruptive ? i am here and seeking discussion on the content matters , although distracted by the edit warring you are engaging in . : that separate historic district article was an embarrassment ( particularly \" the district may include some or all of the historic center of the village of southport , within fairfield \" ) . i restored polaron 's redirect . and polaron is correct , doncram use of rollback in an edit war is a definite \" no - no . \" it 's only supposed to be used for reverting vandalism . : re the statement ' the process should be to discuss these ct nrhp cases here , to involve and get other editors ' consensus , \" i 'd edit that to say that discussion should occur ( somewhere ) . it 's not obvious that talk pages for national register of historic places listings articles are the only place where articles about historic villages can be discussed . : and , yes , both of you are engaged in an edit war ( please cease and desist , or you will find yourselves sanctioned ) , but it should be noted that belligerent statements on a talk page do not exactly promote \" discussion to reach consensus . \" : in advance of opening the discussion here , i consulted with polaron at his talk page , in , about where to hold a central discussion about the multiple , similar situations all involving nrhp listings in ct . i interpreted polaron talking about \" there really should be a process for enforceable merges similar to afd \" as perhaps suggesting he was saying this is not the appropriate place for discussion and or that he would not abide by discussion here . orlady , i hope you are not suggesting that this should be moved somewhere else , or that this is not a fair place to discuss these issues . thanks also for noting that there has been edit warring , i guess , though i think you or anyone else could do better by noting some differential in behavior . also , i do n't appreciate your calling my work an embarrassment . i do n't want to start an escalating insult war with you , too . but i certainly could likewise say the previous southport article was an embarrassment , and my taking action to create an hd article was , at the first step , the best thing that could be done given nris information available plus what was in the southport article . i was not in a position to know about overlap between the village and hd , and there still is no adequate sourcing for the statements about overlap in the southport article . the significantly belligerent actions have been polaron 's overriding , presumptuous edits , in general giving no sources . even if he is knowledgeable about connecticut , the behavior is rude . in this separate discussion section about process , i think it is fair to call it that . georgetown historic district i note that the topic of some previous discussion , [ wiki link : georgetown historic district ( georgetown , connecticut ) ] has been revisited . a short while ago , polaron replaced the article there by redirect to merge it into [ wiki link : georgetown , connecticut ] . i just reverted it to restore the separate article . i believe reasons , including the ones about keeping the disambiguation page system in order , all apply for this case as well . polaron , please discuss and seek consensus which will involve other editors . it is not necessary for you to try to get your way by repeated edits in a low - grade edit war . anyhow , for here , what are the merits you see in eliminating this article ? : same issue as southport . : having not seen southport , i ca n't remark that way but let me ask , is it reasonable to assume that the district and the town or village ( i did n't look at the georgetown article , so i do n't remember which one it is ) are the same ? [ external link : nrhp . com ] says that there are structures in the district , a total that 's probably derived from the nomination form , so likely to be close to correct at least , and it 's clear that the district boundaries are u . s . route , portland ave . , connecticut route , and the nor walk river . is all of georgetown within these boundaries ? is this not more reasonably a specific part of georgetown that could easily be covered in detail , especially if someone with local print sources were to expand it ? : and i should note this is n't like the rugby historic district in tennessee , which is clearly the entire community of [ wiki link : rugby , tennessee rugby ] . in my mind , it 's altogether reasonable to make the rugby hd and others like it into redirects to the community , since there 's nothing that can be said of one but not the other ; however , when an hd is a distinct part of a community , or ( more rarely ; see [ wiki link : bu tte - an ac on da historic district ] ) a community is a distinct part of an hd , it 's much better to have separate articles . : given that the historic district is the core of georgetown ( this is evident , for example , from the historic map and the google satellite image ) and in the absence of any information specific to the historic district beyond the basic statistics provided by the nris database , it seems to me that the information needs and interests of the encyclopedia reader are better served by a single article . if more information is obtained later , perhaps an additional article would be appropriate , but that is not currently the case . : the district and the village ( and the cdp as well ) are not all exactly the same . however , the historic district is not really a distinct section of the village it is in fact the core of the village . the district excludes newer residential areas built around the original manufacturing village but the entire historic district is contained within the boundaries of the modern village and includes most of the population . : i have again restored the article [ wiki link : georgetown historic district ( georgetown , connecticut ) ] and revised it to include , now , three sources . all statements in this nrhp hd article are sourced , including a comment that it is hard to compare it to the unincorporated community of georgetown . the page shows a merger proposal , with discussion to occur here . i would like to keep developing the nrhp hd article to cover the hd , a distinct part of the larger georgetown area . : the georgetown article , on the other hand , is an incomplete article which lacks inline citations and , in my view , fails to come to grips with defining what it is going to cover : what is currently \" common parlance \" for georgetown , what is the cdp , what is the fire district , what is the historical georgetown . it currently has a history section , consisting entirely of one sentence fragment with a red - link : \" the village of georgetown primarily existed [ wiki link : gilbert and bennett manufacturing company ] , which manufactured products out of discarded horse hair in the th century . \" it currently states that the hd has buildings , with no source , now in contrast to the hd article which now provides a nrhp . com - sourced statement that the hd has buildings , instead ( thanks , nyttend ) . : to respond to nyttend 's question , i think it is not reasonable to assume that the district and the town or village . georgetown as an area is apparently large and apparently ill - defined : the current article describes the cdp as being in three ct towns ; the new york times external link in the town article states \" because georgetown is a hamlet rather than an official town , however , its precise boundaries are a matter of opinion . \" overall i interpret that nyt article to say however that in common usage it is in four ct towns , and four school districts ( not mentioned in the current wikipedia article ) . the georgetown article includes population data for the georgetown cdp , which is different than the hd and apparently different than common usage . thus it appears to me that the georgetown article is a bit of a rambling mish - mash , and will remain that way , because of the ill - defined nature of georgetown itself . to return to nyttend 's comment question : there is definitely much which can be said of one but not the other . : i would prefer to develop the georgetown hd article as a more coherent article , keeping it well - sourced and concentrated on the hd area and its contributing properties . i think this is a complementary role to play , which would support the improvement of the georgetown article . the nrhp application , once obtained , will provide extensive detail that is suitable for the hd article but not the georgetown one . the disambiguation set up at [ wiki link : georgetown historic district ] is consistent with this georgetown hd being a separate article . for all these reasons , i would like for the decision here to be . i do n't exactly know how consensus is to be determined here , but i value consensus and the input of multiple editors , or else i would not have opened this discussion and sought comments . : has times redirected the hd page to the georgetown article . i do n't know how to interpret his actions in any way other than they are disrespectful of me personally . and disruptive to the discussion process which i started , first by asking him at his talk page whether this would be an okay place to have the discussion , and which i continue in here . he posted a merger proposal in the georgetown hd article , but then deleted the article by redirecting it . i have restored the merger proposal , with discussion now directed to here . i would be interested to hear polaron 's view on whether he would abide by a consensus decision here in this case and others . : whatever the definition of georgetown you use , the district will always be at its core . all the surrounding areas not in the district are low density newer housing . again , the history of georgetown is the history of the area en com ap assed by the historic district . go ahead and look at the nrhp document for georgetown , you 'll find it is almost all about the gilbert and bennett company . : are you implying now that you have the nrhp document yourself ? i take it that you do . i asked you previously to obtain them , but you have never responded fully in our discussions , and have not disclosed that you would seek to obtain them . do you in fact have all the nrhp documents , for the other nrhp hds under discussion elsewhere on this page ? if so , that would be great , yes , that you would be sitting on sources that would obviously help to resolve these discussions , and yet deliberately withholding that information , and participating instead by low - grade edit warring and goading me , personally . great . : please [ wiki link : wp : agf assume good faith ] , doncram . among other things , that means not attributing negative motives to other wikipedians . now that you 've seen polaron 's response to your question ( below ) , could you considering taking back some of the things you said ? : i appreciate your effort to invoke good faith . i ca n't take back anything about being irritated by polaron 's behavior with respect to having but not sharing information . this is not the first instance ; i only know to enough to challenge him and ask a direct question whether he has that document in hand , because he has acted pere mp torily and only later revealed information that would have allowed a consensus decision , in other cases before . if it helps , though , i could clarify that i should not imply that polaron has go aded me in any additional , separate way ( like by any personal insults , not present here ) , besides by the edit warring , by sometimes pere mp torily and unnecessarily ( in my view ) deleting my contributions in various related articles , and by what i perceive to be gru dging , terse participation in discussion ( including in coming forward only very slowly with information that would help ) . i am willing also to assume that polaron is applying his best judgement about ct places in informing his enforcement - type reversions and other actions ( although those are still unjustifiable in my view ) and that he knows a lot about the ct places , although he has sometimes also reversed himself , and that he would not continue to enforce a redirect if he realizes his initial factual assumptions were incorrect . i do n't know how much that helps . : no , i do n't have them at hand but can look at them in the state library ( our town library does n't have them unfortunately ) . the only ones i actually looked at in the last few weeks are georgetown and quebec square but i only quickly looked through them . i can look up specific ones if needed but i can only do that on saturdays and even then on saturdays that i do n't have anywhere else to be . there is a wikipedia meetup in hartford this saturday that i will hopefully be able to attend and i might be able to quickly look again if you need some specific information . [ outdent ] - i just looked at doncram 's most recent version of [ wiki link : georgetown historic district ( georgetown , connecticut ) ] , and i support polaron 's decision to redirect it to the article about the village . the hd article was as much about the village as it was about the hd , and much of the content that was not about the village was more speculative discussion than it was verifiable content . ( in particular , i refer to this passage : \" the district 's area can not precisely be compared to the modern day community of [ wiki link : georgetown , connecticut ] , because the latter area is not well defined . georgetown is an unincorporated area which has no specific borders . according to one source georgetown includes parts of the incorporated towns of [ wiki link : ridge field , connecticut ridge field ] and [ wiki link : weston , connecticut weston ] as well as parts of red ding and wilcox . \" not only is that little more than uninformed speculation , but it contains an obvious error : there is no town of wilcox in connecticut . ) doncram , if you are impatient to improve the overall quality of entries about this topic , could you take the time to insert inline citations in the georgetown article ? : polaron has again redirected the georgetown historic district article , so i am conf ounded from correcting the apparent error in my statement in the article . the redirect undermines the discussion here , in particular it vac ates orlady 's link to the article . the error is mine , but it was a sourced statement though , so anyone could check the source and correct the statement in the article . i should have said wilton rather than wilcox . : i prefer to develop a well - sourced article about the well - defined historic district , which is clearly wikipedia - notable , rather than participating in development of a community article . i expect that editing in the georgetown article would be an unpleasant experience , because i expect there would be contention about unsourced statements in the article . akin to lv k lock 's note about southport , would i be allowed to strip out the unsourced statements there ? i would be inclined to remove them or to tag them all , and i anticipate that polaron would revert my edits if went in that direction , and we would have a low - grade edit war going on there , instead of in my interest area of articles on historic sites . just one area of dispute for the georgetown and southport articles would be the relationship of the communities to the hds , for which there is a dearth of sources . : i think the right thing to do , process - wise , is for polaron to be en jo ined not to redirect this article , and for me to be allowed to develop it while afd - like discussion is going on here , and for polaron to be blocked if he again redirects the article . i am completely conf ounded by all this disruption , while i have been legitimately trying to open and continue discussion here and development in the article . if you can write a good , comprehensive article about the historic district , you can pretty much strip the entire article about the village . it might be useful to copy the existing article to a talk page subpage for reference but go ahead and remove any dubious statements and or tag any possibly true but unsourced statements . i would welcome someone working on the village article . if the way to do it is to write as if it were just the historic district , be my guest . aside from a differing boundary , any cultural and historical information would be equally applicable . so , please go ahead and do a complete rewrite . : my notion is that when content about the hd is obtained , it could be added to the georgetown article and split off later into a separate article about the hd ( if it turns out that the village and hd are sufficiently distinct to be discussed separately ) . note that much of the existing georgetown article consists of census - derived geographic and demographic information about the georgetown cdp ( this content is sourced but often is not be clearly referenced ) . it would not be advisable to strip that non - hd content from the article . also , because it appears that much of the remainder of this sparse article is actually sourced to the items listed as external links , it should not be terribly difficult to improve the article by adding inline citations . : i see no practical reason why the historic district article can not be started as a stub and allowed to develop . writing a standalone historic district article is a different kind of task than writing a summary blurb about the historic district to include in a town village whatever article , which has to integrate in with other history and other concerns in that article . as a standalone article , the experience of editing is different : there can be a talk page devoted to discussing appropriate other model examples , and questions of sourcing , and so on . if the article has not been developed very far , it is possible to achieve a - fold expansion and put the article up for dyk . while the article is a stub , the presence of the article and its stub tag is an advertisement that this is a safe place to edit , this has been established as wikipedia notable , and it would usually be safe to assume that there will not be edit warring , you can go take pictures of all the listed contributing buildings and include them in the article and no one will delete them , etc . an explicit reqphoto on the talk page calls for those who use the reqphoto system , who might use the google earth tools to browse in all the req photos in connecticut that have coordinates associated with them . the focus of a historic district article is how the buildings , structures , etc . are historical artifacts that , with interpretation , speak to the past history of events and people associated with them . how the architecture expresses the ideals and aspirations of the time , etc . the district is a museum , which consists of individual artifacts . the focus is on these artifacts . other history that is not represented in any artifacts can perhaps be mentioned in passing , but is not germane . : as a section in a village town article , the experience of editing is likely to be different . you can not bring the article to dyk , because there already is other material , like lists of people with any association to the town , which prevents you from achieving a fold expansion . if you edit in the town article and develop it , you may possibly be permitted by some process , yet - to - be - decided , to split it out . but then your edit history and the talk page history will be left behind . or some other person will be the one to split it out , and you wo n't get the satisfaction yourself of getting to create or complete a nice standalone article . and up to that point , your experience will be more contentious , more subject to edit warring , as various parties contend for the importance of school districts , for the placement of a high school sports team 's victory , etc . even if your section on the historic district is good , it will be one good part in an article that you might view as bad otherwise , as an article with multiple unsourced statements and different writing styles and standards than your own . you can not possibly develop a suitable lede for the standalone article that could ultimately be split out , while it is still a section . there will be re arrangements and mergers of material , as you and others seek to integrate modern history and older - than - the - artifacts - history and history of people and events associated with other areas of the town , or not associated with any specific area . you will be bogged down in characterizing the district vs . the other parts of the town . as a town article , it will attract many kinds of editors , who have differing opinions about what is important . and if you do develop the historic district article to describe a significant portion of the contributing properties , it will surely have to be split out eventually . : so why not split it out to start with ? there is no wikipedia policy prohibiting it . there is no question that the hd is notable , and that extensive sources are available to use in developing it ( the nrhp application document for a start , and all the sources in its bibliography ) . taking a long view , there is certainty that the article eventually will be split out . there are some ( perhaps minor ) upfront economies for supporting structure , to get the article split out to the finally intended location for it , sooner rather than later ( structure in disambiguation pages , in the town article itself , in the county nrhp list - article , and in other articles that might link to the hd article ) . it is the opinion of some editors that the early - on material in a stub article , can be swept into the town article , which is fine , and there is , early - on , not an obvious need for wikipedia readers for there to have a separate article . but i do n't think it is right for these editors to be allowed to judge that there can not be a separate article sooner rather than later . and i argue that it is better for wikipedia to allow them to be started sooner , that the will be developed . : that 's my sch pi el ( sp ? ) for now . if there is not some movement on this question for georgetown and other ct nrhp articles in the discussion here , then perhaps it is getting to be time to seek other input . i could make a proposal for an rfc for example . however , i think it is absurd that one would have to seek the input of the wikipedia community world - wide , on the stupid point of whether a wikipedia - notable article ( or about of them in ct ) can be created . fairfield county hds i am disappointed to find that polaron has , despite of or because of discussion about these very issues going on here on this page , gone on to create numerous more redirects and or to paste in nrhp infoboxes , categories , etc into town village neighborhood articles , in a series of edits on june . following are the main fairfield hd nrhp items not yet discussed separately . in most of the cases here where polaron has acted in a series of edits on june in ways that i think detract from the town articles , make it harder for others to get started and create good hd articles , and sets up either total control by himself or continuing conflict . in none of the following cases which i review do i see any evidence of boundaries of nrhp districts vs . boundaries of towns villages neighborhoods . in no case do i see any substantial contribution , it is just cutting and pasting in the elkman output . i think this sets up continuing disagreement which would be avoided if hd articles were left as redlinks to be created as new people come by , or left as minimal stubs , to grow until there is clear information . then , in the few cases where truly is high overlap so that there is little to be discussed in one rather than the other article , it would be easy to implement a merger by consensus . i am kind of afraid to look at polaron 's contribution history over the days since june , and to look at the hds in the other counties . : it might be worth separating the town center districts from the town as a whole for ease of organization . however , village that are or have most of their area included in a historic district should not become separate articles . specifically , the town center ones are : wilton center , brook field center , fairfield , monroe center , red ding center , ridge field center , sherman , and stratford center . these will probably be in the end better as separate articles for organization purposes although the history will be identical to the town . the village neighborhood ones are : as pe ct uck , downtown stamford , glen ville , greenfield hill , hattertown , huntington center , long ridge village , newtown borough , nichols farms , main street ( dan bury ) and round hill . it does not make sense to separate the community article from the historic district . note that in cases where a separate historic district article exist , the neighborhood village article does n't exist ( i . e . there is no separate article for nichols village or downtown dan bury ) . the rest are neither town centers nor prin ic ip al communities ( nor field , putnam hill ) . so basically , villages neighborhoods and historic districts ar better off merged . town centers should probably be split out for easier presentation . wilton center historic district [ wiki link : wilton center historic district ] currently redirects to [ wiki link : wilton , connecticut ] . polaron added the infobox into the wilton town article in [ external link : this recent diff ] . as for other cases , i think the town is far different than this historic district . it seems inappropriate to tag the town article with colonial architecture and other categories that apply to the historic district . the town is not in the national register of historic places , so the nrhp template should be removed from the article and so should the wikiproject nrhp banner be removed from the talk page , in my view . to discuss here , first , what evidence is there of overlap , or can it be acknowledged that the hd is smaller different and removed ? : given no discussion , and apparent - to - me appropriateness of separating this out , i went ahead and started the separate hd article . i revised the town article to link to it and otherwise to conform . : as i said , i have no strong objection to splitting out town centers as these are essentially neighborhoods . i think we 're good to go on this one . : good . i am somewhat surprised , as the timing of your edits on june to put the nrhp infobox into the town article , given dicussion opened to proceed otherwise , seemed to set up combat over this hd . if that is now your reasoning , would you please assist in splitting out the hds to separate articles , to narrow what is the apparent zone of conflict ? : read what i wrote in the top of the main section to understand where i 'm coming from . as i said , i have no strong objection about splitting out town centers . i listed above which ones are town centers . basically , if it redirects to a town article , it is most likely a town center . as pet uck historic district redirected , i presume by polaron , to [ wiki link : as pet uck ] . nrhp infobox etc added by polaron there in [ external link : this edit on june ] . : i moved article to [ wiki link : as pet uck historic district ] and removed all but the nrhp infobox and nris - supported statements . no other information was sourced . brook field center historic district [ wiki link : brook field center historic district ] currently redirects to town of [ wiki link : brook field , connecticut ] . it is so far only mentioned in the article that the hd is within the town . downtown stamford historic district [ wiki link : downtown stamford historic district ] currently redirects to [ wiki link : downtown stamford ] , to which on june by [ external link : this edit ] polaron added nrhp infobox stuff . : i deleted the nrhp hd infobox from the town article , where it seems inappropriate to me . there was no real integration in the town article , so this just amounts to undoing the june edits . : here , rather than starting a stub article with only the nrhp infobox and nris source , could an administrator please just delete the redirect ? the redirect seems unhelpful , with or without the infobox being in the town article , because it suggests the nrhp hd could not be created at that name . : these substantially overlap . the downtown article already describes buildings and what not . it will end up being the same so a single article is preferable . just restructure the current article to fit the historic district information . note this is not a redirect to a town article but to a neighborhood article and we shoudl avoid duplication . : okay , i encounter polaron reversing my edits in the town article . to clarify that a separate hd article can be created , and provide a location for a possible merger discussion , i will create a stub now . : edit warring ? i reverted because a duplicate article does not make sense . now that you 've been reverted , you need to make a case that the articles wo n't end up with substantial overlap . : and i encounter polaron deleting the article - in - progress . i started a stub from one nrhp infobox report , indicating that there was other information to add from other nrhp infobox data . in the process i notice that the infobox that polaron is warring to include in the town article is an incomplete one . he is unaware of how the nrhp infobox system data works , or otherwise chooses not to compose an infobox that conveys the boundary increase information . i save the stub in progress to go get other reports ; polaron reverts to a redirect , judging that there will not can not be enough information for a separate article , i suppose . his edit summary is reasonably nice : \" please be reasonable , i 'm trying to consolidate articles for better presentation \" . anyhow , by the time i encounter the edit conflict , i have developed the article to include dates , areas , and architecture information from the separate nrhp listings that developed this historic district . : this example is a perfect example of polaron warring to prevent another editor from creating an nrhp article , with unjustified pre - judgment that there could not possibly be enough information about downtown stamford historic district that should be in a separate article . actually , i think just the starter information i provided is probably more than is appropriate to edit into village town article , and i have n't even started listing all the , buildings in the district ! : it also is an example of where inappropriate nrhp - related factoids detract from a town article . the town article now is \" architecture \" and no other architecture categories although the town , from the pictures and other knowledge even i have , looks like it is rather more modern , on average . ) that is a stray category from one of the nrhp listings that make up the hd , which include [ wiki link : modern movement ] and other architecture , too . and it is categorized in \" national register of historic places in connecticut \" , while the town is not an nrhp , only some fraction of it is nrhp - listed . the town article includes numerous unsourced statements . i , and i think many would - be nrhp editors , would not enjoy working on the town article , but some would be happy to develop a focussed , all - sourced hd article which could provide support for a better town article . i 'll stop now . main street historic district ( dan bury , connecticut ) [ wiki link : main street historic district ( dan bury , connecticut ) ] article was created by daniel case back in march , seems fine to me . no issues of definition of overlap , etc . , this is a clean , clear short article about the hd . as many most other hd articles could should be done in my view . nichols farms historic district nice article by tom tic ker , not redirected nor field historic district currently redlink , not redirected anywhere putnam hill historic district currently redlink , not redirected anywhere fairfield historic district [ wiki link : fairfield historic district ( fairfield , connecticut ) ] redirects to [ wiki link : fairfield , connecticut ] town article . by [ external link : this edit on june ] , polaron adds nrhp material . : can we revisit this one ? fairfield is a large town including at least three historic districts and a number of other nrhp - listed places . i believe it is fairly obviously appropriate , and it would be consistent with decisions taken on other places , to split out the fairfield historic district from the article about the much -

[ wiki link : glastonbury - rocky hill ferry historic district ] article here . please respect my request that an hd article can be created and developed while a merger discussion is ongoing . please do not remove merger proposal tags , and please do not redirect the hd article , during discussion . ( discussion moved from section about process within [ wiki link : moving forward , cleanup tasks ] , below ) comment by orlady that started the discussion of the ferry , with italicized annotation for clarity : while not a village , the [ wiki link : rocky hill glastonbury ferry ] article that i ran across yesterday is another example ( of a case where the historic district page should be a redirect to article about the feature comm em or ated by the hd ) the historic district designation was sought to recognize preserve the historic ferry , and the article focus should be the ferry , not the me tes and bounds of the historic district that was designated in order to protect the ferry . ) : about the ferry article , i think i had found the ferry hd redirected to it , and i split it out tried to have the redirect deleted . there was no indication that the ferry hd was listed to primarily preserve the ferry . ( speaking to orlady ) i see you did a nice job adding the nrhp infobox stuff into the ferry infobox , and now the article asserts the hd is about the ferry . that 's possible , i did n't check your reference saying that the hd is about the ferry , rather than being an hd preserving architecture in a neighborhood nearby . note there are dozens or hundreds of nrhp hd districts named \" washington park historic district \" or similarly , where the hd is primarily largely the buildings surrounding a park or perhaps a multi - block area in the general area , and where the hd may or may not include the park itself . it is wrong to force mergers of the hd with the ferry park whatever , if it is not known what the nrhp hd covers . to resolve the dispute that is the subject of this rfc , can we agree not to merge nrhp hds without a merger discussion ? to set an example if you agree with this approach to settling the dispute , could you possibly please open a merger discussion section for the ferry case ? : the ferry hd has \" colonial , federal \" architecture styles , suggesting the hd includes more than the ferry itself . the footnote in the article , a hartford c our ant article , is not accessible to me without registration . i think the right thing to do here , consistent with a general solution to the rfc issue , is to split out the ferry hd and allow information to accumulate at its separate article , until a merger proposal can be made by consensus . : you can read the hartford c our ant article in the google cache without registering ( anyway , registration is free ) just search google for the article name and click on the \" cached \" link . the newspaper article makes it clear that the nrhp designation was sought to preserve the historic ferry ( oldest continuously operating in the u . s . ) and associated features on the two shores . the fact that the structures on the two shores are identified as to architectural style appears to be a detail ; their architectural style is not the main reason for the existence of the historic district . ( as you should know by now , i get my back up when i am confronted by the attitude that an entity 's being listed on the national register is more noteworthy than the entity itself . ) : the combination of ( ) the nrhp data saying that transportation was a major function of the district , ( ) the various references that are on the ferry article discussing its listing status , and ( ) the title of the c our ant article led me to believe that this was essentially the ferry with a few other buildings tossed in , rather than the ferry being only a small part of the district or ( obviously incorrectly ) the district being only a small part of the ferry . : i do n't have that attitude . i go out of my way to help create combination infoboxes so that nrhp listing mention can be secondarily included in articles about lighthouses , etc . , and i am very clear that the nrhp listing is secondary . however , in a combo article , there should be notice to arriving readers looking for the nrhp , that this is the correct article , e . g . by stating the nrhp name in bold in the lede . or by a hatnote ( is that what it is called ) , saying the nrhp name redirects to here . : about the process , not the ferry article itself , i am afraid disagreement discussion about an exception here is un ra vel ing a potential solution to a connecticut - wide problem . are you agreeing or not to a process of not forcing mergers of nrhp hds to town ferry park whatever articles , except where there is a merger proposal ? are you agreeing or not to a cleanup program to undo the recent and previous additions of nrhp stuff to hamlet village town articles ? i believe most of these cases are where there is no evidence of extent of nrhp overlap . i am afraid this subject is going to be incredibly time - consuming , still , if there is not an agreement . please state what process you would agree to . : are you talking to me ? i 'll respond , assuming that you are . in short overall , i oppose the redirection of titles in general ; the marion hd is a good example . however , as i 've said before , if the areas are functionally identical , i think that it would be silly . take the [ wiki link : eureka historic district ( eureka , utah ) eureka historic district ] in utah as an example : it 's \" roughly bounded by the city limits \" , so a redirect to [ wiki link : eureka , utah ] is a good idea . as far as something like this : it 's apparent to me that the truly significant part of the district is the ferry itself , with some buildings on one or both sides tossed in . moreover , unlike in marion , we have similar names : it 's obvious that what the nris gives as \" glastonbury - rock hill ferry historic district \" is concentrated on the rocky hill - glastonbury ferry and those buildings associated with the facility . articles on other water - transportation - related places ( not necessarily nrhp ) commonly include information about the buildings around the water : see [ wiki link : port of cleveland ] for an example . take this as an example of what i think of districts that are ( ) concentrated on a specific site or thing , and ( ) include areas around that are connected with the central site or thing . for example , is n't it reasonable to have \" assumption of the blessed virgin mary church complex \" in detroit be a part of ( and perhaps a redirect to ) [ wiki link : assumption of the blessed virgin mary church ] , or \" cat oc tin furnace historic district \" go to [ wiki link : cat oc tin furnace ] , even though there are buildings at the site and only one furnace ? neighborhood districts are different : because the neighborhood itself is a wide area , merging redirecting the title there makes it seem as if the entire neighborhood and the entire district are the same ; the only situation where i think that this would be good is if the entire neighborhood really were listed . ( end of moved discussion , please continue here ) i put the nrhp infobox into the ferry article yesterday , merged with the ferry infobox . it looks better that way . i did n't intend to imply anything . from what i was able to find , the district may be due to the fact that the ferry is \" split \" by the river . it 's not located on one side or the other , but on both . there apparently some buildings associated with the ferry : g la ston bur y rock hill ferry historic district ( added - hartford county - ) roughly along try on st . , ferry ln . and glastonbury ave . , meadow and river view rds . , glastonbury ( acres , buildings , objects ) historic significance : event , architecture engine er ing architect , builder , or engineer : multiple architectural style : colonial , fe der al area of significance : commerce , transportation , agriculture , ar chi tec ture period of significance : - , - owner : private , local gov ' t , state historic function : agriculture sub si stence , domestic , landscape , tran sp or tation historic sub - function : agricultural fields , agricultural out buildings , animal facility , secondary structure , single dwelling , storage , uno c cup ied land current function : agriculture sub si stence , domestic , landscape , tran sp or tation current sub - function : agricultural fields , agricultural out buildings , animal facility , secondary structure , single dwelling , storage , uno c cup ied land now , what do you make of this ? it sounds to me as though the ferry is central , but not alone , by the fact that it 's mentioned in the name of the district . - : ( ec ) thanks for contributing ! : about the merger proposal : i do n't personally want to be developing the nrhp hd article , but it appears to me that the hd is substantially different than the ferry alone , and dicussion of the historic district could easily overwhelm and detract from the ferry article . the hd is apparently quite large on both sides of the river and is far more than merely a few structures in landings areas . check in google satellite view , how far away is \" pe ase lane , g lan ston bury , ct \" , from the ferry . pe ase lane appears to be wholly included in the hd , and is not by any means part of any approach to the ferry crossing . check other streets mentioned in hartford c our ant article . it appears to me that there are hundreds of structures in this hd , and the importance of the hd is partly about being the first one in the town of rocky hill ( while glastonbury has many hds ) , per the c our ant . also , here , no one has collected the nrhp application document . so , currently , i oppose merger , and think it is best to allow the hd article to be developed by any editor who chooses to get the nrhp documents and otherwise develop it . : my bothering to create the hd article is to test out a proposed approach to discussion and development , leading in many cases to merger proposals and non contentious decisions to merge , later . my point is to proceed in an orderly way that allows for information to be developed , constructively , and recorded in articles rather than reflected only in edit summaries and talk page arguments . : i 'm mainly interested in the ferry . i included the nrhp stuff because it was related . should i remove it ? unfortunately , the nrhp infobox does n't allow for mapping a district . it can only be fed a single location , rather than some arbitrary geometric figure based on lat long coordinates , wh ci h it could then map on the loc ma pin image . i looked , as it would 've made more sense . the location in the ferry article is the ferry 's western quay . it 'd have been perfect , from my point of view , if i could have fed the ferry infobox a set of quay coords and or way point coords , so it could map the ferry route on a map , but again , that was n't an option . - : btw , orlady did n't add the n hr p box to this article . see . also , i added the ferry infobox too , further back . i 'd like to call myself teh infobox ma sta , but i 'm not . - : okay , thanks for clarifying to me , it was my misunderstanding that orlady had done that . it 's fine that you did . now that there is a separate hd article , and if it is agreed that it can will be kept separate , then it would make sense to revise your nrhp coverage in the ferry article somewhat . currently the merger proposal is open , and orlady and nyttend 's previous statements were pro - merger . about info for the ferry article , i am sure there is plenty of good historical information , and probably an exact map of the ferry route , included in the nrhp application documents . the exact route of a ferry and specifications about the landings were present in the nrhp application documents for [ wiki link : miller sburg ferry ] , a pennsylvania ferry ( whose hd listing is just the river plus landing areas ) . see the pdf document in its footnote : it is the full nrhp application , available on - line for pa nrhp listings . you can obtain the nrhp document for this ct nrhp by email request to nr reference ( at ) nps . gov . they will send it by email if it has been scanned , or by postal mail , at no charge . hope this helps ! about the merger proposal , i interpret your comments as opposing merger , like me ? thanks . : i can see a separate article for each , where the hd article talks briefly about the ferry and refers people to the full article for more information . what happens to the infobox in that case , i du n no . this assumes that we have a lot more to say about the hd as a whole with the ferry as a kind of side - issue . this is very possible , as what are all these buildings and objects and such which were included in the hd ? why were they included ? was there general agreement to include them ? what 's the history of the area ? did the two sides of the river develop because the ferry was present ? development happened to cambridge due to the [ wiki link : harvard bridge ] , so it 's possible . what do we have to say about the hd ? are there particular buildings we want to talk about at length ? what questions is the hd article to answer ? - : now y' all have gotten me curious . i 've now requested the nrhp application . let 's see what develops . - : they have responded by telling me it 'll be or weeks . - : i suspect the , - acre area is wrong , and that it 's really only acres ( which is still pretty large ) . this is largely based on the discovery that nris has extra zeros on the ac re ages of other hds . i 've outlined the issue on the article talk page for the hd . : what 's an order of magnitude or two between friends ? i would n't be surprised if someone lost a decimal place after \" . - wow , that was fast . according to the reply , they recently finished di gi tizing all connecticut - related files , so i now have the application and photos documents , each as a pdf . i 'll place them where y' all can get them later today . - : here they are , grab 'em : [ external link : scanned text of and pictures from the application ] . i 'm working on oc ring the text right now . if i succeed , or once i succeed , it 'll be there too . - : thanks ! about the merger proposal that is still outstanding here , i think the nrhp documents make it clear that this nrhp hd is not very much at all about the ferry , and that it makes sense to keep the ferry article clean and separate . this is different from one ferry nrhp in pennsylvania , where the nrhp hd was the water plus landings only ; this nrhp hd is about the ship building community and farm sc apes . the ferry article is appropriately linked from the nrhp hd article , and vice versa . i sen sed before that den i ma dept also tended to agree the two seemed different , before , and with the documents den i ma dept has collected i think it is more clear . so i would like to move that the merger discussion in this case be closed as \" do not merge \" . for this merger split case and others i hope we could round up some uninvolved third parties to assist in c lo sings , but i am hoping we the involved parties could just agree here and take this one off the table . : yes , i have very little interest in the hd . i just wanted to be involved before someone screwed up the ferry article . - d if i 'd been interested in the hd , i 'd have finished proofing and reformatting the word doc . as it is , i have n't actually finished reading it . my focus is on bridges . even the ferry itself is kinda secondary . the hd , from my point of view , is tertiary at most . - : * after seeing the nom form , i agree with doncram that the ferry is only a small ( but significant ) part of this historic district , so it makes sense to have a separate article about the hd . : ps - for the benefit of posterity , i 'd appreciate it if this discussion were archived ( after it is concluded ) on the talk page for one of the affected articles ( where people interested in the article have a good chance of finding it ) , rather than in the archives for this talk page . : so , are we done here ? - tol land county hds i went through the or so nrhp hds in [ wiki link : national register of historic places listings in tol land county , connecticut ] , the smallest ct nrhp list . i found that redirects to town village articles had been set up for all of them . trying something different , i requested deletion of the redirect for each instance where there was no information about the nrhp in the redirect target article , which was maybe a dozen or more cases . given others ' distaste for stub nrhp articles ( which i understand ) , i think it is best for there to be just a redlink from the nrhp list - article , and to leave it to any interested nrhp editor to start the article . in a few cases the redirect was to a cdp article that covers an area different from the hd but which had been edited to include the nrhp categories ( which usually do not apply ) and infobox . i removed that material and linked instead to a new separate nrhp hd stub which i created . in a couple cases the nrhp info had been placed into a new article about a hamlet , with no other information about the hamlet . i moved the article or created a new article from scratch for the nrhp hds , leaving a redirect from the hamlet name . in many of these cases , my steps effectively attempts to reverse redirects that had been set up , but i believe in many most cases polaron 's revised preferences would be to not include the nrhp hd in the previous target article . if there any cases where there is disagreement , those should be listed and discussed here . in no case , however , did i find any source evidence that the nrhp hd was substantially the same as one of the town village targets , which would be needed as part of arguing ( why argue ? ) that the hd should be merged . : let 's say that i had never heard of the nrhp or this dispute until now . if i believed that you were right by fact and by policy , would it be right for me to delete these redirects ? are these supposed to be some sort of prod tags , or speedy delete tags ? i 'm quite confused about the tags that you placed . : i think so , i am in fact requesting the redirects to town articles where there is no nrhp info in the town article , to be deleted . this is a proposal , below , in [ wiki link : moving forward , cleanup tasks ] below , to ask you or other admin to go through and delete such redirects . the speedy delete requests i first placed on several tol land county redirects were technically incorrect and have all been rejected , i believe . i 've just tagged some of the redirects with vague - sounding template category , . by \" cleanup \" , i personally want all those to be deleted . maybe the same template category could be used in some future cleanup project too , but here i have just used it to tag redirects that are un helpfully implying an hd article exists , and should be deleted . type ( ? ) in discussion below . : speedy deletion would certainly not be proper ; you should either use [ wiki link : wp : prod prod ] ( if you do n't expect any opposition ) or [ wiki link : wp : rfd rfd ] . : here is one thought : * [ wiki link : tol land , connecticut ] does have some information about [ wiki link : tol land green historic district ] , which makes the current redirect more useful than no information at all ( or could be the basis for a stub article ) . : i responded in the rfd for the tol land green hd redirect , at [ wiki link : wikipedia : redirects for discussion log june various tol land county , connecticut nrhp hds ] , which is where discussion about this one should continue , i believe . wind ham county hds in the absence of other movement , i am beginning to review [ wiki link : national register of historic places listings in wind ham county , connecticut wind ham county nrhps ] . [ wiki link : broad street - davis park historic district ] and [ wiki link : bush hill historic district ] are two that had surprising - to - me redirects and some evidence in edit history of combative edits . i 've restored articles for them and added links from town neighborhood articles to which they were redirected . i think it 's possible that now there would not be disagreement , but am mentioning these here in case there is interest in discussion . * i 've edited [ wiki link : broad street - davis park historic district ] and put a merge template on it . given the paucity of information in the hd article , it makes far more sense to send a user to the article about the small borough of [ wiki link : daniel son , connecticut ] ( at least until such time as the hd article has meaningful content ) instead of exposing the user to an article that says little more than \" fill - in - name historic district is a historic district . \" [ wiki link : bush hill historic district ] looks like its sufficiently distinct from the town that it needs an article , though . : i continued through the wind ham county nrhp hds and replaced a number of redirects with nrhp stub articles , adding wikilinks to these stubs from the town cdp hamlet articles they had been redirected to , if the town cdp hamlet article actually mentioned them already ( at least some did not ) . please feel free to check them all and discuss . i believe polaron has noted at least some of these already and \" approves \" in at least some . broad street - davis park historic district ( discussion moved by doncram , to here , from daniel son , connecticut article . doncram ) i propose merging [ wiki link : broad street - davis park historic district ] into this article ( leaving a redirect behind ) because the stub article about the historic district has far too little content or context to merit a stand - alone article . the stub is currently a database entry in two different formats : once as an infobox and once as prose . it explains nothing about why the district is listed ( we can be reasonably sure that the architectural styles represented are not the reason for its listing more likely it has to do with the history of the community ) , nor what the surrounding community is like , nor anything else that justifies the existence of an encyclopedia entry . the daniel son article also is sparse , but the combination of the various elements ( boilerplate info on geography and demographics , boilerplate info on two historic districts , and a few user - contributed elements including images ) are the beginnings of a worthwhile article that already provides greater understanding of the hd than the separate hd article does . as i understand it , the idea that nrhp listings are \" inherently notable \" is predicated on the notion that sufficient information has been published about each listing to impart notability and form the basis for an article . this does not necessarily mean that an article should exist for every such listing even in the absence of that \" sufficient information . \" : about the [ wiki link : broad street - davis park historic district ] , i suppose we can have the same discussion . there is a paucity of sources so far , but the nrhp hd has an extensive , authoritative nrhp application document which can be obtained which will provide detail for future editors to tab ulate and describe and illustrate the contributing properties . it is not conceivable to me that it will be appropriate to include all that detail in the daniel son town article . : note , daniel son is a town village whatever with at least two separate historic districts . it will be impossible for someone to document that daniel son is the same as the first one and also that daniel son is the same as the second one , which is distinct from the first . rather impossible actually . orlady , it seems inconsistent with your arguments elsewhere that you should seek to enforce a merger here . could you please just withdraw the merger proposal ? or , let 's discuss here in this section , in parallel with other ct merger proposals on this page . i will seek to direct the merger proposal tags to point discussion to here . : i 'm inclined to leave this as a separate article as this is basically a park and its adjacent street , which will have a somewhat different history from the borough as a whole . this is a different situation from unincorporated new england villages . new london county hds i 'm starting through the nrhp hds in [ wiki link : national register of historic places listings in new london county , connecticut ] now .

promptly deleted and put in place a redirect to [ wiki link : thimble islands ] . he copied in most or all of the nrhp hd article into the thimble islands article . polaron , i do n't get what about the suggested process you do n't understand . the process is : ) do n't delete my work , ) make a premature merger proposal if you wish , ) wait for me to point out the merger is premature because no one has obtained the nrhp document and other materials , to allow for informed judgment about geographical overlap , etc . do n't delete my work , please , again . this is beyond tedious ! you have n't made a merger proposal , but let me point out that the nrhp hd includes first in its name \" [ wiki link : stony creek ] \" which is a non - island area outside thimble islands . it seems random to me that you are trying to redirect the article to the thimble article rather than to the stony creek article . certainly the nrhp hd spans two areas and it will probably not ever be appropriate to shoe horn it into one or the other . even if you had the nrhp application , which i presume you do n't . you just do n't get to go around erasing wikipedia - valid nrhp articles with no due process , no consensus . : excuse me , but . in the discussion at [ wiki link : wikipedia : redirects for discussion log july various new haven county , ct , redirects rfd ] ( that 's a link to the specific discussion ) , doncram proposed deletion of the redirect , polaron said \" keep the islands article is an appropriate place to discuss the district . the entire island group is in the district . \" and doncram proceeded to create a new article in place of the redirect after saying \" there is was no mention of the nrhp hd in the article , but if u say there is substantial overlap then a separate nrhp hd article needs to be created and or the nrhp hd is to be discussed as part of thimble islands article . merger vs . split discussion to occur elsewhere . \" that does n't look like a consensus process to me , but rather like unilateral action . if you truly want others to engage in productive discussion with you , i suggest that you refrain from short - cir cu iting discussions by taking unilateral action that is calculated to get a reaction . sorry , but the \" process \" i see doncram \" suggesting \" seems to boil down to \" do things my way or get out of the way \" , and that 's not the wikipedia way . : that was a discussion of the redirect . it seems that polaron and perhaps you want for there to be substantial discussion of the nature of the nrhp hd and so on . so i created the nrhp hd article , to start that . this , here , rather than at [ wiki link : wp : rfd ] , is an okay place to discuss whether the nrhp hd should be kept separate or should be merged . honestly i thought creating the nrhp hd article was fine and productive to do . note , there was no mention of the nrhp hd at all in the thimble islands article , and on the face of it , also , it covers area in stony creek , first , so it just appeared the redirect was a surprising , unhelpful one . polaron has since taken issue with that , by copying the material i created into the thimble islands article , but on the face of it it was reasonable for me to assume there would be no real issue ( i did assume that ) . about \" my way or the highway \" , that is why all this is going on , that polaron showed editing practices of edit warring to get his way , on numerous ct nrhp hd topics , previously . i have invested tens of hours if not hundreds of hours now in attempting to deal with this constructively , notifying everyone of every step i take , and he is battling by redirecting , on the basis of his opinion and in the absence of sources . this is back to the rfc question : shall one editor be allowed to force his views , in the absence of sources and information . all the time i put in to create constructive discussion is wasted here . you , orlady , should get beyond looking at the small - scale assertions of fact about these places , and look at the bigger process here , and at who is ignoring wikipedia processes and forcing his opinion . : and you 're not forcing your opinion ? and you 're not edit warring ? if you look at the bigger picture , you would be adding content rather than edit warring . i have re focused to adding content in the past days , which i hope you will as well . unless yourself will be working to expand these articles in the future , please allow editors who are interested in expanding them to edit the articles in the way they prefer . in case you have n't noticed , at the moment , no one else really edits connecticut locality articles substantially but me . if you are making a commitment to expand these in the near future , i 'll let your editorial preferences stand . otherwise , let the people who are interested in these topics have their editorial preferences stand . : ( comment moved from talk of the nrhp hd article by doncram ) : the islands are the main part . only a narrow strip of the mainland is included . content should be expanded at the main article . : i do n't follow what is the \" main article \" . the nrhp hd article is the main article about the nrhp hd . if you have maps or information , by all means please share . on the face of it , the name of the nrhp hd includes first the name [ wiki link : stony creek ] , perhaps suggesting that the stony creek mainland portion is the larger or more important part of the nrhp hd . it is immediately obvious that there is significant difference geographically between the nrhp hd and the thimble islands . : stony creek is the entire southeast section of bran ford . it is basically the portion of the nd voting district east of the stream known as \" stony creek \" . the route historic district is partly in stony creek . the thimble islands are also part of stony creek . it is true that den se st part of stony creek is in that strip heading towards the thimble islands but that portion is a tiny part of stony creek . : i do n't believe a word you say . i have given you leeway in countless discussions , assuming you have knowledge , but at this point i do n't care what you supposedly know . you have no sources . if you do have sources , you hold them back and do n't add . this is getting impossible to deal with . : i added more to develop the nrhp hd article , and polaron redirected it again , losing the content that i added ( when he redirected a previous time , he had copied my content into the thimble islands article ) . i restored the nrhp hd article and added a bit more . the process is : allow development of separate articles . discuss civilly . make a merger proposal if you like . do not delete valid wikipedia articles and content unilaterally . i think your behavior is disruptive and unhelpful and it is edit warring and destructive , deliberately ignoring wikipedia processes . i would block you from editing , if i were an administrator and were not involved . : oh , i 'm sure you know more about this area than i do as i have never contributed anything worthwhile . also , no one is deleting information here . i am consolidating the relevant information into the main article . why is it that i must be the one to propose a merge . for a change , you should allow a consolidated article to develop and propose a split if you think the article is getting too long . i have given you a lot of leeway in letting the split articles stand proposing mergers even though the original state was a merged article . per [ wiki link : wp : status quo ] you should be the one proposing a split . all you have done in the discussion mergers is to stonewall and not even consider each case on its own merit . is there a point in even discussing with you if you 've already made up your mind ? : a ) i did n't say i knew more ; i do say that i try to write only what is supported by reliable sources ; b ) you did delete information ( not at first , but later ) ; c ) you must propose the merger because you wish for the merger . you could just let there be two articles , i do n't get why you are interested in battling to make just one . d ) i do let the town cdp village articles develop , i do not delete them . i have been removing the nrhp infobox which is especially duplicative in appearance and removing nrhp categories , but leaving in all the text coverage about the nrhp hd in the village whatever article , whatever you like . i do insist that a link to the separate nrhp hd be included . e ) there you go with the wp : status quo now , whose relevance is unclear to me . f ) about \" stonewalling \" , i do feel that i have backed into a knee jerk type reaction to oppose mergers , but note , that in all but one of these recent cases has someone gotten the stupid nrhp application document ( in the one case , there was an nrhp document online which clarified the nrhp hd is different from the village cdp whatever ) . why wo n't you get the reliable source that is most relevant to all these ? and then please share it . otherwise , all these merger proposals are ridiculously ill - informed . : look i do n't merge just everything together . i do give some thought as to which ones to merge and which ones to split , ok ? in almost all cases where merging is appropriate , the histories are identical . you should be the one to propose the split because i initially setup the articles as merged and that is the status quo . i have given you a lot of leeway in allowing a split then proposing a merge . if there is information that got left out during the merge , let me know and i will add it to the consolidated article . if you let me have my editorial preferences , i will expand these consolidated articles including using the nrhp source . you could just let the merged articles stand . they will explain the differences and specifics . i do n't get why you are interested in battling to have them separate and redundant . : you seem to think that it would be equivalent process in wikipedia to enforce merger until there is consensus for a split , but a ) that is not how wikipedia works , and b ) that would not allow separate content to be developed . it would unnecessarily inhibit editors from developing nrhp hd material that clearly does not fit with a town cdp village topic , and it unnecessarily would separate edit history from the separate nrhp hd article which will in most cases be developed eventually . it works to allow there to be two articles , developed in competition if you will , and then make a merger proposal . it does not work logically to suppress development of one , until it is proven ( how ? ) that the one is different from the other . : wikipedia process wise , stub articles can be created on any wikipedia topic , if their wikipedia notability can be defended in afds . the nrhp hds are wikipedia notable . your putting a redirect in place of one , does not establish any meaningful status quo or anything . a redirect is not an article . the first - level correct process for you to follow , if you want a merger , is to propose that . then if consensus is not reached ( and it seems unlikely in any case where the nrhp application has not been obtained for one thing ) , then you put the article you wish to disappear up for afd . i believe that will not ever work for nrhp hds , knock on wood , because they are wikipedia notable , but that is the stronger , second wikipedia process to use if you are frustrated by a lack of consensus on a merger . afds often conclude with decisions to merge material and redirect . : i appreciate that you do seem now to give more different thought to which ones you seek to merge , and that you do not now battle to force redirects mergers for many ( perhaps about of the original ct nrhp hds that you originally redirected to town cdp village articles ) . but , your judgment now is still not informed by actual facts and sources . you are still over - confident in your knowledge of connecticut towns and history , in the absence of having the actual nrhp hd application documents . how would you know the merging is appropriate ? how would you know the histories are identical ? you ca n't and do n't know . : it 's also nice you offer to expand articles using the nrhp source , but i believe you have not once requested and obtained a free nrhp hd application document . i understand you went and consulted some nrhp documents in hartford , but afaik you do n't have copies of even those . i would give more leeway to someone who actually was working from the relevant document and was actually developing the nrhp hd information . sigh . nobody wants to delete anything . one does not need to afd an article in order to redirect a redundant article into another one . everything i 've proposed so far qualifies under [ wiki link : wp : merge ] . the fact that there is one article rather than two does not pre ven anyone from expanding the topic in question . propose a split once you 've added enough content and it looks like the main article is getting too long . : actually discussing a merger before it happens is different . merging redirecting a contentious subject without discussion is not the way that we 're supposed to go , especially since both merge candidate and merge target are notable . : and , doncram is not the only one opposed to these redirects mergers . he 's just the only one with the energy and stub bor ness to continually and me tho dically make the views of the pro - hd article side as apparent as the views of polaron . i agree with orlady that content development is a su per i o ir way to use time . however , it appears that often when doncram tries to develop content in an hd article , polaron redirects it . i do n't understand how polaron can contend that this does n't block development of the hd stuff . it is much easier to start from scratch and develop an article on a historic district than it is to add content to existing articles , e as pe cially stub articles about some little place . why is a geo - stub automatically the more nor able when both a geo stub and an nrhp stub exist ? i would even go so far as to offer to develop the hd stuff , me tho dically , if someone will provide me with a list . i 'll request the nrhp documents , and use them to develop an appropriate hd article for every contested merge split . i wo n't go looking for them , though . it is too tedious and too disheartening in light of watching doncram 's attempts at development era dic ated . recently , in a no ther state , orlady proposed merging [ wiki link : be thel historic district ( be thel , missouri ) ] . i responded by using the available online nrhp info to develop the article , and orlady responded by deleting the merge proposal , even though she still would have preferred the merge . in my view , that was productive . i 'm sure i have more to say , but honestly , i just find this whole thing ex as per ating . middlesex county hds please see [ wiki link : wikipedia : redirects for discussion log july various middlesex county , ct , redirects ] . i proposed deletion of - redirects away from valid nrhp hd wikipedia article topics , which should show as redlinks instead at [ wiki link : national register of historic places listings in middlesex county , connecticut ] . as i went through the county nrhp list i addressed some others by creating nrhp hd stub articles . if there is disagreement that should be noted here . but , the redirects to be deleted should be non - controversial , i think . : to update from the rfd , polaron approves of others but objected to deleting one , [ wiki link : fen wick historic district ] , which currently redirects to [ wiki link : fen wick , connecticut ] , an article about a borough . li tch field county hds please see [ wiki link : wikipedia : redirects for discussion log august various li tch field county , ct , redirects ] , in progress , where i 'll try to identify ones that should not be controversial , where red - links should be restored to encourage article creation . canaan village historic district [ wiki link : canaan village historic district ] redirects to [ wiki link : canaan ( cdp ) , connecticut ] , an article about a cdp which currently claims the cdp is a historic district . on its face , that assertion is almost surely a false statement . can this one be separated ? certainly the cdp article should be revised to remove false statements . i wo n't put this in the rfd proposal as there may be disagreement . : since canaan village ( the place ) , canaan village ( the historic district designated on an nrhp nom form ) , and canaan village ( the cdp designated by the census bureau ) clearly are all the same place ( not to be confused with the town of canaan ) and there 's precious little information in any article about any aspect of canaan village , i oppose splitting this topic into separate articles . : do you have a copy of the nrhp nom form ? that would be very helpful . otherwise , i do n't believe your assertion that anything is \" clearly \" the same as something else . i am fine with your merging the cdp with information about the village ; i just would prefer to have the nrhp hd separate as it is known to be notable and i believe there is no clear information available showing it is the same or nearly the same as the cdp ( or the village ) . : no , i do n't have a copy of the nom form . i have driven through canaan a bunch of times , by passed it on the highway a few other times , and even stopped off there once for lunch . i say that mostly because i know it makes absolutely no difference here . as i see it , the cdp and the historic district are less \" notable \" than the village . [ wiki link : canaan ( cdp ) , connecticut ] , which is the subject of an article , is merely a statistical entity . this [ wiki link : canaan village historic district ] , about which you are eager to write a stub article , is a conceptual entity that exists primarily on paper , in the form of an nrhp nom form that has been du ti fully filed and digitized by the nps and the state of connecticut . meanwhile , the actual village of canaan , connecticut the very real place that has existed for a couple of centuries and has a commercial district is ignored by wikipedians . i would like to see one decent consolidated article about the village that includes the demographic data that are the cdp articles raison d' etre , the information about the historic aspects of the village that are recognized by the hd designation , and such other information about the place that people can assemble . i fully recognize that you will oppose that , because you are more interested in the paperwork on file at nps than you are in the real - life village that the paperwork describes . falls village district [ wiki link : falls village district ] was a redirect to [ wiki link : canaan , connecticut ] an article which does not mention the historic district . believing it was an obvious case , i first proposed deletion of the redirect , but i have now replaced the redirect , instead , by an nrhp stub article . this was per discussion at [ wiki link : wikipedia : redirects for discussion log august various li tch field county , ct , redirects ] where objected to proposal to simply delete the redirect . i believe that neither she nor i have any sources actually speaking to whether an unincorporated village and an nrhp hd are substantially the same or not . i have requested a copy of the nrhp application document . this note here is just to record that there is some issue , and this therefore may be subject of a merger proposal at some later time , hopefully after some share able sources have been collected . : much like canaan , i 've been to falls village and had friends who lived there . it 's a well - defined discrete place that also exists as a postal address . however , that does n't matter when your goal is to write articles about nrhp nom forms . : i do n't think that falls village should redirect to canaan . the village needs a separate article . and as you have likely gathered by now , while i 'm interested in writing articles that document historic villages and i think that nrhp nom forms can be good resources for those articles , i 'm not interested in wikipedia articles about nrhp nom forms and database entries . lake ville historic district [ wiki link : lake ville historic district ] currently redirects to [ wiki link : lake ville ( salisbury , connecticut ) ] where it is asserted that the village is the hd and or vice versa . i do n't believe any sources are included which actually describe bounds of either or assert degree of overlap in geography and history . : as you have probably guessed by now , i 've been to lake ville , too . unlike some of the other new england villages on the national register , which are of more interest for their industrial history than for the buildings they contain , lake ville is full of ar chi tec tur ally interesting buildings . i think lake ville needs an article separate from the town of salisbury , and i 'm not at all interested in an article about the nom for the lake ville hd . lime rock historic district [ wiki link : lime rock historic district ] currently redirects to [ wiki link : lime rock ( salisbury ) ] where it is asserted the village is the hd and or vice versa . i do n't believe any sources are included which actually describe bounds of either or assert degree of overlap in geography and history . : you 'll be relieved to hear that i 've never been to lime rock , but i think that the article about the village is the perfect place to describe whatever historic aspects and elements of the village are recognized in the nrhp listing and documented on the oh - so - precious nom form . the historic district information would be an informative addition to the short article . by the way , the historic iron industry of lime rock and other parts of salisbury and canaan is discussed in [ externa link : http : www . peabody . yale . edu collections min ct minerals pt . pdf ] a document that i cited in the [ wiki link : stafford hollow , connecticut ] article . nrhp town name issues\n",

( citation needed ? ) i think the term ' tele centric lens ' is very misleading . tele centricity is more a function of the aperture than the glass . perhaps we should rather speak of a ' tele centric aperture ' ? ' tele centric optical system ' would be best . maybe it 's not a weird lens , but the focal plane seems a weird place to put the aperture . does this clarify ? i still think the diagrams are misleading and confusing , due to the tele centricity . by the way , please do n't delete the images - the [ wiki link : tele centric ] page has a ' diagram request ' on it , and i 've linked these in the talk page . oh - just re - read that page - why do you deny that either lens is tele centric ? i thought the whole point of the second image was demonstrating tele centricity ? that page uses the definition tele centric : the chief rays , that is the rays through the center of the entrance or exit pupil , are all parallel to the optical axis , on one or both sides of the lens , no matter what part of the image space or object space they go through . is n't that true in the diagrams - the middle one of the three rays from each of the two object points ? am i missing something ? i do n't think i 'm being dense - this really is n't clear . each different point on the object ' sees ' the entrance pupil in a different place , immediately below it , but ' located ' infinitely far away . not meaning to be personal , but would i be wrong in de duc ing that you are primarily a micro sc op ist ? that would explain the pre di lection for tele centricity .

( [ wiki link : irreducible randomness ] ) . here , one should make a clear distinction between ubiquitous concepts of [ wiki link : determinism ] , [ wiki link : causality ] , and free will . : determinism means that there is some causal structure ( each event has its own past and future ) , and that , given all there is to know about an events past , the laws of nature determine uniquely what happens at said event . in other words , there is no \" freedom of any choice \" anymore . : however , there is a difference between determinism and randomness . determinism has something to do with \" predicting the future \" , while randomness has [ wiki link : a priori ] no link with any causal or [ wiki link : temporal ] flow . randomness applies as well to the past as to the future . randomness means \" one out of many \" . you have one corpse , and potential murderers . who did it , is random , until you find more evidence . the outcome of a football game is random ( even if the game is over ) , until you learn about it ( by watching the video or hearing it on the radio or something ) . this where we find this interpretation of quantum theory to be invalid . conscious collapse ?

according to the teacher and the book , but if you did the same ones in a real environment , with drag , the projectile would not land the same place , depending on the situation , it could be micro meters , or miles away . if you stood a pencil up on its point , and let go , there is no telling where it might go ! actually there is , if you could bring in every single variable into a master equation , you could find out exactly where the pencil would land . you would have to know exactly where your fingers where , how much angular momentum you placed on the object when you released . you would have to create a three - di men sin al map of the table surface . you would have to acquire a four - dimensional map of temperature variation , air pressure , humidity , molecular kinetic energy , etc . that 's why it is called [ wiki link : chaos ] . chaos can be seen as a spectrum . near - randomness , meaning a near - infinite amount of variables , is at the top , whereas something with one variable , would be at the bottom . if you wanted to determine of aristotle was mortal , than all you would need as information would be \" all humans are mortal \" and \" aristotle was a human . \" if you did n't know what the hell an aristotle was , it would be random , because you have no information . if you knew that aristotle was from greece , that would mean there is a significantly smaller probability that aristotle is human , because there much more possibilities of different things being in greece than there are people in greece . : probability as a way of describing situation where we lack complete information . we may have some , but the best we can do now is to approximate it to having none , because we do n't have enough compared to what we need . in the quantum world , we rely on a lack of information to predict and test things . re latedly : possible outcomes of flipping two coins two heads two tails one of e ach there are three outcomes . what is the probability of producing two heads ? : pulling from the article on [ wiki link : sat y endra nathan bose ] : while at the university of dhaka , bose wrote a short article called planck 's law and the hypothesis of light qu anta , describing the photo electric effect and based on a lecture he had given on the ultraviolet catastrophe . during this lecture , in which he had intended to show his students that theory predicted results not in accordance with experimental results , bose made an embarrassing statistical error which gave a prediction that agreed with observations , a contradiction . : what are the possibilities of flipping two coins ? two heads two tails one of each . but are n't the coins distinct ? since the coins are distinct , there are two outcomes which produce a head and a tail . the probability of two heads is one - fourth , not one - third . the error was a simple mistake that would appear obviously wrong to anyone with a basic understanding of statistics , and similar to arguing that flipping two fair coins will produce two heads one - third of the time . however , it produced correct results , and bose realized it might not be a mistake at all . outcome probabilities coin head tail coin head hh ht tail th tt since the coins are distinct , there are two outcomes which produce a head and a tail . the probability of two heads is one - fourth . : physics journals refused to publish bose 's paper . it was their contention that he had presented to them a simple mistake , and bose 's findings were ignored . he wrote to albert einstein , who immediately agreed with him and loved the idea . physicists stopped laughing when einstein sent zeit s ch ri ft f r phy si k to accompany bose 's , which were both published in . : also , one more thing di gre s sing a bit .

thanks , this would be fun to write a short essay about ( although sometimes they do end up getting long ) . did you read ? humans are over populating the world ? is the statement \" humans are over populating the world \" justified ? i am skeptical , as i always am . yes , because tons of people did say that a few years ago . although where are the facts to back it up ? i wrote this for my history class one time . : thomas malthus 's writings on population shaped economic thinking for generations . malthus gri mly predicted that population would out pace the food supply , leading to a decrease in food person . this prediction was based on the idea that population , if unchecked , increases at a theoretical exponential rate ( i . e . , etc . ) , whereas food supply would grow theoretically at an arithmetic rate ( i . e . , etc . ) . resulting decrease in the food person ratio would eventually lead to not happy times for the human race . today this scenario is called a [ wiki link : malthusian catastrophe ] . according the malthus , the catastrophe can only be prevented by \" misery . \" what he means by this is intentional self - restraint or vices . malthus favored moral re stra ints , including late marriages and sexual abstinence , but only for the working and poor classes . thus , the lower social classes take a great deal of responsibility for the ills of society . of the vices , he leaned toward cont rac eption and abortion , as being the best , also , mainly for working and poor classes . : the influence of malthus 's hypothesis was readily accepted during the s . previously , high fertility had been considered an economic plus because it increased the amount of available workers into the nation 's economy . however , malthus looked at it from a different perspective , and convinced most economists that even though the higher fertility might increase the gross output , it tended to reduce output per capita . : concerns about malthus 's theory also helped promote the idea of a national population census in the uk , influenced the whig party 's beliefs , and charles darwin 's origin of species had a section oh malthusian catastrophe . : recent research and significant empirical evidence have showed malthus to be wrong . the population has continued to grow , yet the prices of resources and foods relative to wages has decreased , indicating the supply of food ( and resources ) has grown relative to population size . malthusian hypothesis also makes several incorrect assumptions nobody caught for centuries . first , population growth is almost never exponential . it is influenced by too many factors and variables that no model can describe . actual demographics since malthus 's time show that population growth rates fl att en and then grow negatively , as a function of wealth . malthus lived in the time when england went through a geometric growth before birth rates flat tened , and he failed to study the large populations in asia which existed over multiple millennia where such flat tening of birth rates has been evident . : malthus also could not have known that agriculture was already undergoing a radical modernization that would change it from a arithmetic growth rate to an exponential the [ wiki link : green revolution ] . second , he did not fully understand the additional leeway built into the agricultural system while most people ( even the poor ) , ate a high meat diet , a vegetarian diet can feed more people per far med area than a car ni vor ous diet . third , he failed to realize the extent that ' misery ' , in the form of war , disease , violent crime , and pollution , can prevent excessive population growth before it reaches the crisis levels that would result in the famine deaths he predicted . : if things would have kept going in exactly the same way as they had been , malthusian cat astro phes may have been common . however , things never keep going exactly how they have been . things change . just as individual species are at this very moment , rising , falling , exploding , bott len ec king , taking over , and being pushed back , natural conditions on the earth , and outside the earth change . each change will somehow offset any and all models that do not take into account the infinite factors , variables , and changes . alluding to chaos theory , i end with the same thing i have already told you . about every few decades somebody re sur rec ts the hypothesis , with the last big scare being [ wiki link : the population bomb ] , by paul e hr lich . if he had watched his facts ( which he most definitely did ) , he would have known that population increase had already been dropping for decades before he published the book . [ external link : pretty graph ] e hr lich , a butterfly specialist , began his spectacular doom saying career back in ( publishing date marked in the graph ) with his best - selling book . among his predictions then and since : \" the battle to feed humanity is over . in the s the world will undergo fam ines . hundreds of millions of people ( including americans ) are going to starve to death . \" ( ) : \" smog disasters \" in might kill , people in new york and los angeles . ( ) : \" i would take even money that england will not exist in the year . \" ( ) : \" before , mankind will enter a genuine age of scarcity . in which the accessible supplies of many key minerals will be facing depletion . \" ( ) today : ) food production is well ahead of population growth obesity is a major issue for millions in the united states , ) the air in new york and l . a . is cleaner than it has been in decades , ) england is still here , and ) there are no key minerals facing depletion . almost all of them , along with raw materials in general , are far cheaper now relative either to the consumer price index or wages . but have e hr lich 's preposterous predictions hurt his reputation ? far from it - they 've made him both celebrated and rich . in - he published [ wiki link : the population explosion ] , which received the macarthur foundation 's famous \" genius award \" with a , check , and split a swedish royal academy of science prize worth , . e hr lich had a column for a few years in the atlantic monthly : \" since natural resources are finite , increased consumption must inevitably lead to depletion and scarcity . \" of course , right ? environmental depletion and hub bert 's [ wiki link : peak oil ] look at copper . as it became scar cer , industry used new technology to switch to equal or even superior materials . copper phone wi ring went the way of the dodo , replaced by glass fiber optics that are dirt - cheap and made out of a raw material even e hr lich does n't fear for - sand . they are also vastly superior in the number and quality of transmissions they can carry . oil ? right now its the one we hear about . every day . last week it was popular what iran said to try and scare the us government . president [ wiki link : mahmoud ahmadinejad ] ( i believe ) said that oil prices will be over soon . some reports said , but that 's just the news media . it has fal is fi ablity , that is good . however not much the only thing that can invalidate peak oil would be confirmation that oil is abi otic in origin , with a generation rate that could re pl en ish re ser vo irs over a human time scale . the russians , and some in the west ( notably [ wiki link : tommy gold ] ) , have argued for this , but they find few supporters amongst most petroleum geologists . the underlying concept has been hijacked by alar mists , conspiracy nuts , and those who take a psychotic delight in en vis aging the end of civilisation as we know it . that does not invalidate the underlying concept , which is nothing less than the application of common sense . the theory was originally proposed in relation to the us . the ' experts ' de cried it . production in the us peaked as predicted by theory . that is quite good validation , in my view . although there is a problem . theory and experiment do not match up . see graph comparison . the problem is that having been usurped by doom and g loom merchants the worst case scenario is painted . equally , sensible lobbyists will note that since we are uncertain of just when production will peak it would be prudent to look towards the worst case situation . i 'm not saying peak oil is n't real . the us already hit peak oil in . like the malthusian catastrophe , i 'm saying peak oil is not anything you should be worried about . usgs , probably the top authority currently , finds that peak oil may not be hit for - years . decreasing crop yields but on and on e hr lich goes . \" human - induced land degradation , \" he says , \" affects about of the planet 's ve ge tated land surface , \" and is \" accelerating nearly everywhere , reducing crop yields . \" reducing ? our si los run ne th over , as yields continue to increase all over the world . for example , corn is now the world 's most important crop . according to a article , we now harvest about more corn per acre than years ago . and , says hudson institute analyst dennis avery , crop yields can be raised from the current world average of around . tons per acre to six to nine tons . advances in genetics since , have sky ro cke ted crop yields . alternative fuels like pretty much every other physicist in the world , i push the most for nuclear fusion funding . this is one of those \" investments , \" like health care , that i do n't think we put as much funding into as we should , because there are not immediate , but future benefits . the thing wrong with alternative fuels . there is a lot of things wrong . things differ as per theorized energy source , but mostly it is ignorance that leads us to believe they are actually better . break even this is what it is all about in the energy business . you need to have to gain more useable energy than you lost . the further we per severe into the future , the more energy we need to use , and we have progressed greatly . we have gone from manpower , to animal - power , to biomass , to chemical burning ( all of them could actually be placed into chemical burning ) . we can simplify energy spent to money spent linear relationship i think . right now , every single possible alternative fuel source is very to extremely expensive , and much more energy is spent than gained on these \" fuel \" sources . with more funding , it will change , but we need to decide which gets the most , if any , and how much . we can not use a fuel source if we have to make it . if you read science fiction , or are were exposed to it ( greene probably mentioned it a million times ) , anti matter is a suggested fuel source . this will never work , unless sometime in the far future when we are intergalactic travelers , we find some areas of the universe where in the interstellar dust there anti matter atoms , or anything made of anti matter that we find . problems i 'll hit a few thought - of fuels . hydrogen : it will never work . everything you see about it is just imagination . sorry , but imagination does n't work that well if you want to run the world on it . production the actual environmental impacts associated with hydrogen production can be compared with alternatives , taking into account not only the emissions and efficiency of the hydrogen production process but also the efficiency of the hydrogen conversion to electricity in a fuel cell . moreover , every ' green ' source produces rather low - intensity energy ( which can be scaled up , but at an efficiency cost ) , not the pro di gi ous amounts of energy required for extracting significant amounts of hydrogen , like [ wiki link : high - temperature electrolysis ] . there is concern about the energy - consuming process of manufacturing the [ wiki link : hydrogen ] . manufacturing hydrogen requires a hydrogen carrier such as a [ wiki link : fossil fuel ] or water . the former con sum es the fossil resource and produces carbon dioxide , while [ wiki link : electrolysis electro ly zing ] water requires electricity , which is mostly generated at present using conventional fuels ( [ wiki link : fossil fuel ] or [ wiki link : nuclear power ] ) . while [ wiki link : alternative energy ] sources like [ wiki link : wind energy wind ] and [ wiki link : solar power ] could also be used , they are still more expensive given current prices of fossil fuels and nuclear energy , and are low - intensity . in this regard , hydrogen fuel itself can not be called truly independent of fossil fuels ( or completely non - polluting ) , unless a totally nuclear or renewable energy option were considered . the energy that must be utilized per kilogram to produce , transport and deliver hy ro gen ( i . e . , is well - to - tank energy use ) is approximately mega jou les . subtracting this energy from the enthal py of one kilogram of hydrogen , which is mega jou les , and dividing by the enthal py , yields a thermal energy efficiency of roughly sixty percent ( k rei th , ) . gasoline , by comparison , requires less energy input , per gallon , at the refinery , and comparatively little energy is required to transport it and store it owing to its high energy density per gallon at ambient temperatures . well - to - tank , the supply chain for gasoline is roughly percent efficient ( wang , ) . storage hydrogen gas at has an extremely poor energy density per volume . as a result , if it is to be stored and used as fuel onboard the vehicle , molecular hydrogen must be pres su ri zed or li que fied to provide sufficient driving range . even then , liquid hydrogen has a volume over times greater than li qui fied gasoline , and it 's energy density is times less . liquid hydrogen is cr yo genic and boils at - . f . [ wiki link : cr yo genic ] storage cuts weight but requires large [ wiki link : li qui fication ] energies . the li que faction process , involving pres su ri zing and cooling steps , is very energy intensive . the li que fied hydrogen has lower energy density per volume than gasoline by approximately a factor of four . storage tanks must also be well insulated to minimize boil off . ice may form around the tank and help cor ro de it further if the insulation fails . insulation for liquid hydrogen tanks is usually expensive and delicate . the mass of the tanks needed for compressed hydrogen reduces the fuel economy of the vehicle . hydrogen also , when stored causes [ wiki link : hydrogen em bri tt lement ] . that sucks . hydrogen use would require the alteration of industry and transport on a scale never seen before in history . for example , the distributing hydrogen fuel for vehicles will require an entirely new infrastructure which , just in the u . s . , would cost trillions . see [ wiki link : the hype about hydrogen ] . sum of all generally in order of worst idea to best . biomass burning : the burning of wood or dung as people in pristine , natural third world garden spots do , but that does n't do much for the trees or the air quality , and great ens gh g emissions . hydrogen is the one i know a little about , already said . hydroelectric dams : it would take about , square miles of deep enough water to supply enough power for maryland . the fish do n't appreciate it . wind power : extremely loud . requires about square miles for only maryland . sla ugh ters birds more efficiently than a human hunter could . a wind farm in norway 's sm la islands is reported to have destroyed a colony of sea eagles according to the british royal society for the protection of birds . a six - week study in estimated that over bats were killed by turbines at two sites in the eastern us . ( i think i 'll start adding references ) . this study suggests some site locations may be particularly hazardous to local bat populations , and that more research is urgently needed . mi gr atory bat species appear to be particularly at risk , especially during key movement periods ( spring and more importantly in fall ) . l asi ur ines such as the hoary bat ( l asi urus c ine re us ) , and red bat ( l asi urus bo real is ) along with semi - mi gr atory silver - haired bats ( las ion y c ter is noc tiv ag ans ) appear to be most vulnerable at north american sites . almost nothing is known about current populations of these species and the impact on bat numbers as a result of mortality at wind power locations . solar power : even assuming the sun is out , it 's too expensive . i would put it as second best bet though if you had to pick from one of these . [ wiki link : ethanol ] and diesel - type bio fuels : in development , i favor solar power and this . right now it is in a somewhat similar state as solar power . this does not require a complete reworking of our energy system and totally new - built infrastructure . electricity : where the hell do you think we get the electricity from ? either fossil fuels or these ways . wrap up there really is n't an \" environmentally sensitive \" way to get energy . you have to take from the environment to get usable energy , you can not create a fuel source to use because that is spending more energy than you are gaining . mr . e hr lich wrote : \" no way of mo bi li zing energy is free of environmentally damaging side effects , and the uses to which energy from any source is put usually have negative environmental effects as well . \" scientific magazines : finally , i have to say : you say that journals are the best sources of unbiased ( or the least - biased , anyway ) information . how would you rate magazines like [ wiki link : discover ( magazine ) discover ] and [ wiki link : scientific american ] on the basis of bias , reliability , and factual accuracy ? discover and sciam fall in exactly the same spot . bias : more than journals , less than all other forms of media . you will never catch them contradicting themselves with two conflicting articles , and de fin ti ely no neutral or evan bias on global warming or anything \" green . \" reliability factual accuracy : reliability and factual accuracy to be the same , no ? if you read the articles , as far as i know , these two are not total liars . these two are popularized , and tailored to the common science - minded american . thanks , [ ] august - december : sorry i write so much . ) [ ] ( ) thanks op hi on , after discovering the truth behind the recycling scandal , and learning a bit more about other things , i have achieved having a little bit more confidence , and more of a lack of respect for environmentalism in general . i have it my goal to write a master essay concerning this . i have no idea how long it will be . i already have pages to work with . this is gon na be so much fun . perhaps i should do it in wiki format ? eh ?

      "bc \" added this enormous comment in the \" planning some updates \" section above . i 've moved it to the end of the page and added this heading . hi all . i never really noticed this separate \" killian documents authenticity issues \" wiki until recently . while i have made a couple of casual postings in regards to newcomer , i had n't really wandered through the entire section . some of you may know me from [ external link : this page ] i maintain , and which is due for a major update by , hopefully , the end of the month . for all intents and purposes , the authenticity discussion is now pretty much resolved it 's impossible for at least one of them memos to have been forged because the contents had information connected to records that were n't released by the dod until sept . th , which happens to be after cbs had received all six memos from bur kett , two on sept . nd and the rest on sept . this shoots down a key contention the pro - for gers had used to explain the contents of the memos that the for ger has used publicly available records , like those contained [ external link : on this dod site ] , to fill in the details of the memos . the memo in question is [ external link : a very short one dated february nd , ] , that was n't even used by cbs . the memo makes a very interesting passing mention of \" bath \" aka james bath , a future business partner of bush , and who was verbally suspended by killian exactly one month after bush was and for the exact same official reasons , and whose name is now currently and [ external link : very mysteriously redacted ] from currently available dod records . very , very inte re sing , but that 's not even the relevant part . the memo also indicates a concern about flight certification for both bush and bath . looking through the raw , un sorted flight records on the dod does n't really tell you much , so i thought to see what would happen if i entered those records into a spread sheet and then sort , sum and graph in different ways to see any sort of obvious pattern that would connect to a flight certification worry . what i ended up with was [ external link : this graph ] , which shows a clear , sharp rise in training flights ( in yellow ) coinciding with the date on the memo . obviously the additional training flights were for bush to meet certification . if we had bath 's flight records , we would likely see something very similar or even identical . i had initially used this bit of analysis to show ludicrous it is to believe that a for ger would go all through this trouble just to get an indication that bush needed training flights for something that the for ger confidently guessed had to be for meeting flight certification . but that was before a nagging feeling got me to check when the flight records were actually released by the dod , which turned out to sept . th too late by just a couple of days for any for ger to have used . some people i 've already debated on this , while gru dg ingly admitting that i have a point here , claim that it could be that some of the memos are true while the others are fake . since all of the memos show the same character type , spacing and other characteristics , that 's an unfounded and basically idiotic explanation . if one is proven impossible to have been forged , then that becomes defacto authentication of not just that one memo but for all of them since there is no other explanation . a or b , forged or not forged . there is no \" c \" option . this then gets back to how the forgery charges started and who is responsible and culpable for their spread , and whether it was done out of genuine confusion ( even if pushed along by a political agenda ) or with deliberate , malicious intent , and what roles did the bloggers and the mainstream media , especially cbs played in all this . the [ external link : initial free republic post ] by [ external link : \" buck head \" ] was laughably wrong and confused in every way regarding [ external link : 's office technology ] , but that served well enough to [ external link : stir up the right wing blog sites . ] so the initial surge of forgery charges were based on a post , by a gop activist , that was filled with utterly nonsensical information about 's era office . an ig no min ious start for what will be an utterly ig no min ious episode of journalism being sup planted by mob news . those forgery charges then sur ged to another level with the posting of another blogger the following day , charles johnson of little green foot balls , who stated in [ external link : a post with the title \" bush guard documents : forged \" ] that : i opened microsoft word , set the font to microsoft 's times new roman , tab bed over to the default tab stop to enter the date \" august , \" then typed the rest of the document purportedly from the personal records of the late lieutenant colonel jerry b . killian . and my microsoft word version , typed in , is an exact match for the documents trum pe ted by cbs news as \" authentic . \" and it was in this post johnson that displayed his first overlay experiment using the \" cya \" memo , which also happened to be the shortest and simplest of the memos cbs used in their report . subsequently he \" refined \" his overlay experiment and ended up with [ external link : a post that included the animated gif ] that got extremely wide circulation . now , near the beginning of this page , in an aside , \" derex \" asks , also , did the fellow who made the \" blinking gif \" ever do the same for the other documents ? i 've always wondered because a bunch of the features really do n't look like a great match to me . i 'd find it a lot more compelling to see tham all done , otherwise it makes me wonder if he \" cherry - picked \" the only one that sort of looked ok . just asking for my own curiosity . the answer is no , johnson did n't . how do i know ? i asked johnson in a very recent email about whether he attempted to recreate any of the other memos in word , and if not , why not since \" it would seem logical and proper to have tried the overlay experiment with all of the memos before coming to the rather harsh conclusion that all of them were forged . \" his response was only [ external link : a link to another post of his ] comparing but not over laying one of the other memos , the one dated [ external link : may th , ] the second simplest one of the memos . and what would happen if the overlay experiment was done on the some of the other memos ? the much malign ed ( by right wing blog sites , that is ) dr . david hai ley obtained some high resolution copies of the memos from mary ma pes and tried johnson 's overlay trick with the somewhat complicated aug . st memo and got [ external link : this result ] . a bit less convincing , no ? since the proportional spacing in times roman ( mac , what johnson used ) and times new roman ( windows ) is highly derivative of the proportional spacing used by the early word processing systems especially ones using diablo and diablo compatible da is y wheel printers , which were the standard for about a dozen years prior to the first laser printers you would actually expect some sort of rough match - up on a shorter memo like the cya one , but not so much with more complicated and or longer one . which is the exact situation we have here . but does this necessarily mean johnson deliberately perpetrated a fraud ? could n't he have been just a rank amateur who got this interesting result from a test , reached a snap , poorly thought out conclusion and just could n't wait to post it all ? possible in theory , but extremely , extremely unlikely . he made [ external link : a number of postings from sept . , through the th ] in regards to the memos , and spent considerable time fut zing only with the cya memo . in [ external link : one of those posts ] , though , he discusses his qualifications or \" bona fides \" in regards to his tests and conclusions , stating : i 've been involved with desktop publishing software and scalable software fonts ( as opposed to hot lead type ) almost since their inception . i 'm a former west coast editor of a popular computer magazine for a now - orphaned computer , the atari st tt . i also co - owned a software publishing firm , code head technologies , for whom i designed and laid out packaging and manuals for more than a dozen products ( in addition to developing most of those products , using x assembly language ) . we used a combination of d tp and traditional type setting techniques for these jobs , and i cut my teeth on some of the first serious d tp software ever created for personal computers including al dus pag emaker and al dus free hand on the mac , and less recognizable titles available for atari computers ( anyone still using cal amus or pag est ream out there ? ) . my software company also marketed a word processing program ( cal li grapher , written by a developer in britain ) that had the ability to import and use postscript type fonts . and i had early experience with some of the dinosaur - like dedicated word processors that were available in the s s . i 'm not boasting like this just to pump up my li zar do id ego ; it 's to let you know that i have an extensive background in these subjects and when i tell you that there 's no way the cbs news documents were created on any machine available in , i ai n't just wh i st lin ' dixie . ' all of which makes it highly improbable in the extreme that he did n't at some point type up word rec re ations of all memos , and then proceeded to deliberately ignore the overt discrepencies in at least the may th and aug . st memos for a \" created by word \" scenario in order to go forward with his claim that all the documents were forged . such deliberate cherry picking of data to support a hypothesis is considered outright fraud in the scientific community , and it 's apparently no less the case here . so the second escalation of the forgery charges came about from an apparently utterly fraudulent post . more ig no min i ousness . now wh i ther the mainstream media , especially cbs , with their collective vast resources , in all this ? mia , basically . research and investigation was limited to a [ external link : few inclusive interviews ] and very , very little , if at all into the appearance issue , which is what the forgery charged were based on . also completely lacking was any attempt to systematic match up the contents of the memos to official records there were all sorts of dated information , so . no . how about the technology available in offices in the 's anybody do much checking into that ? aside from [ external link : re la ying the evidently unchecked opinions of dubious experts ] like joseph newcomer , there was none at all it was virtually all se lec tric this and se lec tric that . it 's very telling that is took a casual comment by marian carr knox , an office pool secretary ( no , she was n't killian 's personal secretary ) about how she had an olympia typewriter that a little \" th \" key that there was even a suggestion that more than se lec tric type writers existed back then . did the mainstream media follow up ? no . did they note [ external link : this document ] in the dod records with pristine , super scripted \" th 's \" that was obviously not created on a modern word processor ? no , again . how about when the dod , after having claimed to have finally posted all off bush 's records , quietly released , within days of [ external link : cbs backing away from the memos ] , another pdf packet of files labeled [ external link : documents released on september , ] that contained very pe c ul arly formatted documents , including [ external link : the only proportionally printed one ] in the entire dod site did the news media make even a mention of this ? no , again . collectively they were absolutely worthless and journal istically incompetent in every way in regards to the memos mess , allowing for the forgery charges to grow futher , with every would - be sherlock pointing out [ external link : increasingly idiotic \" proof \" ] of forgery . but what about cbs , the once proud network of [ external link : edward r . mur row ] be set by the hounds of the right wing blogosphere and abandoned by their fellow news organizations , how did they respond ? fully investigate and address the forgery charges ? no . take a time out to see if they more fully authentic ate the memos ? no . what they ended up doing was turn tail and run , and then try to save face by setting up a supposedly [ external link : independent panel ] to \" probe \" the memos story . the resulting [ external link : \" report \" ] showed a laughably incompetent amount of real investigation was done , indicating that it was never more than a face - saving effort to find scape goats for the memos mess . according to the dod records , bobby hodges and especially rufus martin should have been able to answer and clear up a lot of the discrepencies in the official records , nevermind the memos , but they were only asked some lame questions that they di sen gen ously evaded answering , including who even it was that suspended bush from flight status . so some people got our right canned , including mary ma pes , and dan rather was apparently forced out . the one person who knew best of all whether the memos were real or not , bush himself , was evidently never asked and who to this day avoided making any direct comments on the matter . why would he not have made a comment ? it was a while ago , but getting canned from flying would not be something you would forget , especially with a big shot dad who was a hot shot pilot in his day . bush 's silence only makes sense if the memos were real and not forged the right wing media was doing just fine and dandy in giving cbs and dan rather grief over the matter , including even dragging in kerry , so why ruin a good thing ? obviously if bush was a man of strong ethics and good character , he would have spoken up regardless , but . he never did . so basically , to summarize , the forgery charges were bogus from beginning to end , the news media completely fell down on its collective face in sorting out fact from even outright nonsense , the blogosphere showed itself to be worthless as a legitimate alternative news media , and a really , really bad person got re - elected because of it all . hope this clarifies . - bc\n",

[ wiki link : ] : where is the evidence that she was thought to be blonde ? because we said so : and why would we ask you ? : seeing as many versions of this goddess existed in areas of the middle east and m edi ter r anian , and of course , greece , i doubt she was seen as very frequently blonde . i ca n't help thinking that this person must have seen a few episodes too many of [ wiki link : xena ] and or [ wiki link : hercules : the legendary journeys ] ; the version of her that appears in those is blonde ( modeled after the \" [ wiki link : valley girl ] \" stereotype ) , which should n't be too surprising considering there were other supposedly greek or middle eastern people that were portrayed by blonde actors ( though i ca n't recall if gabrielle was supposed to be gre cian or not , come to think of it ) . in truth , i 've never seen a person i 've known to be of purely greek or middle eastern blood that was blonde ( though i know there 's some blonde italians , but they 're of mixed blood , no ? some norman or something , iirc ) . hence , the goddess would probably not have been thought to be blonde more than she would be raven - haired ; quite the opposite , i 'm sure that most people thought of her as dark - haired . on a side note - aphrodite may not have had the wisdom of hermes or athena , and she may have been ( ok , was ) really impulsive , but she coni ved quite a bit , and was usually quite good at said coni ving . she 's selfish ; not a complete moron . ; ) ( and this comes from someone who was always more of an athena artemis fan , at that ) : to those of you critics above , the greeks realized that the gods themselves were not greek or of any earthly heritage , and many gods were described as having long golden hair , so we can not assume that because the followers of the goddess were greek that she was too . she very well may have been blonde . also , aphrodite was not forced into marriage , she chose he pha estus . she was not responsible for looks , just love and lust , so it could be argued that he pha estus was a bad choice , but it was not in her power to make him handsome . i should know , since i am a hellenistic re con str uc tionist myself . the preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : sign your posts on talk pages unsigned ] comment was added by . well , i 'll argue that because of ap hor dite 's connection to ish tar . it makes bl on der hair , unlikely . tar ah and aphrodite who is this tar ah ? . i 've never heard of such a character on any of the greek mythology sites and believe this to be some character of fanfiction . if she is not can someone direct me ( links preferred ) to stories of her ( preferably with classical quotes ) . it just seems fake . i just do n't want to see vandalised articles ( especially in this area as it is my source of reference when i 'm unsure of what i 've learned ) big vee : that was a vandalized version of the article that has since been corrected . you should n't be seeing it now . maybe you have to clear your cache , or something ? it no longer shows up . one question thought . exactly what did the vandal do to make it un editable for me ? * as i had tried to fix it myself since it was a rather obvious fake * was it because i was seeing a remnant of a vandalised article perhaps ? how does this happen ? thanks * gone to read on christopher wal ken * big vee aphrodite 's name . re di rec tis it possible that aphrodite 's name could 've been based on the [ wiki link : cr asis ] of ( from ( \" rose \" ) ? i want to know more about aphrodite does she have powers or does n't she thats the thing i want to know any way is n't ap hr o mean in greece terms foam as that is how she was born by foam in the water any way i think that aphrodite must have been an amazing goddess and actually how many children did she have , how did she die thats some of the questions i want to be answer d but if you ca n't thats alright any way i hope my questions get answer d and if they do n't but just one more thing why is aphrodite so famous and why did she get picked to be the goddess of love ? ? goddess of love ? is n't she essentially an agent of sexual attraction , not romantic love in the western sense ? : why yes , there is love without [ wiki link : romance ( genre ) ] , not part of the conventions of [ wiki link : c our tly love ] nor the associations that come with [ wiki link : romanticism ] . : thx , & i think the greeks would have agreed with you . ' goddess of love ' is what we tell the children perhaps . i added a line to the beginning . she was both . generally the greeks titled her ur ania ( heavenly ) as the goddess of the emotion of love , and pan demos ( common ) as the goddess of physical desire . remember the ancients also invented the \" love story \" like the famous tale of hero and leander . : that should be discussed in the article then , especially in the lead . : the late , and purely philosophical distinction between an aphrodite our ania and an aphrodite pan demos is touched upon in the article . is any of the following needed : \" although referred to as \" the goddess of love and of beauty \" , it is important to note that such love is not kari tas ha bun dat , or [ wiki link : divine love ] , as in the [ wiki link : love ( religious views ) christian christian ] tradition , but specifically [ wiki link : eros ( mythology ) eros ] ( physical attraction or sexual love ) . \" why is it \" important to note \" christian theological views of love in an article on aphrodite ? \" christian interpreters \" already get a mention . perhaps some more specific sourced pat ri stic remarks about aphrodite would be more appropriate than this . image cropping is there a reason the image of the [ wiki link : the birth of venus ( bot tic elli ) birth of venus ] is cropped so weir dly ? is this a result of some discussion past ? : i 'm not responsible , but it does give a nice closeup of the subject of this article , whereas the complete painting is illustrated at its own page . images while everyone knows that aphrodite and venus are essentially the same goddess as viewed through successive cultures , i do n't think it 's appropriate that birth of venus - no matter how well - know - is an illustration for an article on aphrodite . bot tic elli named the figure venus , so use it in the article for venus . surely there is a great abundance of artworks depicting aphrodite that can be used here instead . illyrian \" etymology \" an anonymity has contributed an etymology \" illyrian , albanian afro - di ti or pro - di ti next close to the day ( morning star ) . \" now , how would we have an illyrian word for morning star \" from the present handful of inscriptions and possibly illyrian placenames ? is di ti albanian for morning star ? this original research needs work before it can be made credible . hello , i 'm just replying you to clarify why some or many of olympic gods can be traced or lastly explained by albanian language . first of all it 's true we call \" aphrodite \" - af r dita and it got a clear meaning in albanian af r near - dit day , hence together the meaning is \" af r dit \" \" morning star \" . i am just clarifying out of desire to inform and not speculate , other olympic gods do really have meaning in albanian language , but that 's requires alot of academic studies hence i refrain myself to jump into conclusions and leave the matter the professionals . regards , pin j ol lii am not the anonymity mentioned above , but am a german living in albania since . on june , , i added the following to the etymology section : \" albanian : af r dita ( af r near , dit day ) , \" morning star \" . \" this was reversed by someone else the same day [ wow , is someone continuously monitoring these sites ? ] with the argument that aphrodite is a greek goddess , not an albanian one . why then not take out the reference to latin venus ? aphrodite was no roman goddess either . either gods and goddesses are truly divine and transcend etymological or national barriers , or they are cultural aspects the study of which may lead to historically interesting questions . regrettably , when it comes to etymology , references often end with latin or greek even though a word may not mean anything in those languages - which does n't provide any deeper insight . if however , in this specific case , we take one more step back , we end up with an albanian ( or pre - albanian , illyrian or pel as gian ) word actually still being used , not only as a common first name but also as a description of the planet venus . what does it mean that the name of the greek goddess aphrodite does n't mean anything in the greek language , but in albanian it does ? albania is full of ancient places , including apo ll onia where aristotle studied . if in albanian the original meaning for aphrodite is still preserved in everyday language , and befitting for a goddess no matter if greek or not , someone may wonder whether those gods and goddesses were maybe pre - albanian colon izers of the hellenic peninsula , and just obtained god - like status in the legends of the inhabitants . i understand that it may not be politically ( or otherwise ) correct to say that hellenic culture originated from albanian ancestors , but i believe it can enrich our knowledge and insight , and provide resources for further study , not to always stop with latin or greek origins . just think of the word \" secure \" . so it comes from latin \" se cu ri tas \" meaning \" security \" ( wow , what an insight ! ) . in today 's albanian , the corresponding word \" si gur t \" comes from \" si gur t \" \" as rocks \" or \" [ solid ] like the rocks \" . now does n't that explanation feel more like it ? to refer to words in older languages which just look and mean the same is more like translating . only if you find deeper roots it looks like finding ety mo logic origins . th im m , egyptian ha thor not ne ph thys ha thor was the egyptian cow goddess of love and beauty and fun , and a wet nurse to horus . so she corresponds to aphrodite venus in the love and beauty department . where as ne ph thys was a funeral goddess associated with anu bis and em bal ming ! no connection to aphrodite at all except in the delusions of the se tian - satanists . comm is er ations wiki . nikki temple prostitution at cor in th this bit has been expanded by an anonymous pass er - by . since temple prostitution is ever a favored subject for hobby ists and under graduates of all ages , i wonder whether we have a source for such practices at cor in th . ritual prostitution this part i added i believe should be able to stay in the article : she is said to have devised public prostitution by putting up the bro th els . she forced married women to enter them . at testing to her invention was the centuries old tradition by the cypriots . they sent their young ladies to the beaches to lie with foreigners . this way they made do w ri es for their future marriage . later this deplorable practice reached italy and was also done by the loc rians .

      "thanks for taking on the onerous task of upgrading refs . : re tech tree , i could never work a better way to describe the situation that would n't get out of proportion to the rest of the article . so i 'll list what i think are the main points here ( i 'm watching this article , a so i can respond fairly quickly if there any points you 'd like to discuss ) : * in every recognised x game that i 've ever played , what buildings you have only influences how fast you can research and build , not what you can research and build . in the rts [ wiki link : command conquer ] series there 's no research , but you can only build the more advanced units if you have a tech center battle lab . in [ wiki link : total annihilation ] ( incl ta : k ; also rts ) there 's also no research - but more advanced units can only be built at more expensive factories , and some advanced buildings can only be started by advanced builder units form the advanced factories . in the age of empires series and off shoots like the empire earth series ( rts again ) : what you can research depends on what buildings you have ( different techs require different buildings ) and on your epoch ; you can only go up an epoch if you have at least buildings that were first made available when you entered your current epoch . so at least all the x games i know are consistent in not caring what buildings you have . : * the epo chs business is a little more complicated . at first sight it looks as if the [ wiki link : civilization ( series ) civilization ] series requires you to go up an epoch in order to research some more advanced units ( and other techs ) ; the most visible indicator of this is that you get an end - of - turn announcement , \" the x civilization has entered the . age \" , and the icons for your buildings change . but that 's just a cosmetic feature : there are no \" advance an epoch \" research projects in the tech tree ; but in civ 's very complex tech tree ( see below ) the tech whose discovery triggers the \" new epoch \" messages are pre re qu i sites for more advanced units and buildings . : * x tech trees are more diverse in structure . those of the [ wiki link : master of orion ] and [ wiki link : space ward ho ! ] series consists of several different research subjects , and theoretically you could research all the way to the top level in one subject but neglect the rest . the [ wiki link : space empires ] series is similar , except that when you research to a certain level in subject ( or sometimes ) a whole new subject is revealed ( and you can still research further advances in the ones that were available before ) . the civilization series has the most complex ( as does a mid - s x game , [ wiki link : as cen dancy ( computer game ) as cen dancy ] ) , where each non - basic tech has pre re qu i sites , and that limits how far you can research in area while neglecting others . : * balance between civilian and military techs . in many rts games tech advances are almost ex l usi v ley military ( e . g . [ wiki link : starcraft ] ) . but in most tbs and some rts games the research and production costs of top - end military techs are so high that you have to build up your economy and research productivity first ( rts - [ wiki link : age of empires ] , [ wiki link : empire earth ] , where one of the most significant costs is going up an epoch ; tbs - the [ wiki link : civilisation ] series and [ wiki link : master of orion ] series ) . but this is not a universal rule - in the age of empires series and off shoots you need to research economy - enhancing techs in order to research and build advanced units at a reasonable rate . : * in some non - x games , e . g . [ wiki link : starcraft ] , the basic units continue to be effective all the way through the game . in most x games an advanced unit will usually beat more than its production cost in significantly less advanced units . what counts as a more advanced unit varies : in the civilization series new types of unit become available after certain advances and there 's virtually nothing you can do to improve existing lower - tech units ; in [ wiki link : master of orion ii ] and [ wiki link : master of orion iii ] you can build e . g . battleships from the start , but can ref it existing ships to take advantage of new techs ; i think [ wiki link : sid meier 's alpha centauri ] ( in the civilization series ) might have borrowed some ideas from the moo games , but i 'm not sure . : of course all this is [ wiki link : wp : or ] and only applies to the games i 've played . : re \" constraints on growth and warfare \" , the sources are usually the game manuals and screens . the civilization series has exceptionally detailed manuals ( especially civ i ; the civ ii manual often seems to assume you know civ i pretty well ) which make clear the constraints presented by unrest and internal politics . the [ wiki link : master of orion ] and [ wiki link : master of orion ii ] manuals are almost equally explicit about how strong a constraint pollution is . : but that raises another point generally , about why i described upgrading refs as an \" onerous task \" . the original reviews and strategy guides for many of these games are long gone ( and sometimes useless , see [ wiki link : alan em rich ] 's critique [ external link : decline of guides ] ) . where the games are still played , the real expertise resides at forums such as [ external link : master o for ion . blogspot . com ] and [ external link : civ fanatics ] ( and similarly for non - x games ; e . g [ external link : gn ug . org ] for [ wiki link : total annihilation ] ) . it might be very difficult to get better refs . good luck ! response : thanks for getting back to me . i agree this will be difficult . the good news is that a good of the article has been referenced at this stage . the bad news is that the last is proving very hard . so far i have been very careful to reference material rather than deleting unreferenced material . i do n't want to delete useful information just because i have n't been able to verify and cite it yet . but if push comes to shove , we might actually improve the article by deleting a few statements . so let 's talk specifics : * i see you added a reference to [ wiki link : strange adventures in infinite space ] as a short x game . but it 's not a x game . it 's more of a short action adventure game . ( it 's kind of like a [ wiki link : ro gue like ] in space . ) the game involves exploring and extermination but you do n't really build an empire or settlements or anything . i was going to quickly scrub this part but since you added it i wanted to see what you had to say . : i referenced the article by the strange adventures in infinite space developer to illustrate how some developers deliberately aim for beer 'n pre tz els tim es cal es . if you prefer more x - specific refs [ external link : ho tu : stellar conquest iii ] , [ external link : moby games : space ward ho ! iv for windows ] , [ external link : ho tu ( again ) : dead lock ] are what i got from pages of google results ( \" x game beer pre tz els \" ) ; in this case also replace the existing ho tu ref for space ward ho ! with the moby ref for space ward ho ! iv . : done * i noticed your attempt to clarify the quote from the \" difficulties with definition \" section . but you seem to have made the quote less accurate rather than more accurate . i was wondering what your rationale was since i 'm trying to stay close to what the references actually say . : do you mean [ external link : moby games ] ? that page says ( bottom of section ) : \" for purposes of this game group , games where primary gameplay focuses only on extermination without any other possible victory conditions ( my em ph ) are excluded from this game group . this means games such as age of empires , war craft , command conquer , heroes of might and magic should not go here . \" i think \" includes the requirement that it must be possible to win without ex ter min ating all opponents \" is a fair summary of that . or are you concerned about something else ? * onto the technology tree . you 're right that a lot of that appears to be or . but a lot of it also happens to seem true . would you feel comfortable re - writing that section to cut to the safest and most useful facts ? i could reference individual numbers ( who 's the longest , who 's the shortest , who 's the widest or most \" complex \" ) but i think it 's starting to cloud the article . maybe a quick statement about \" game ? has one of the longest technology trees , at ? techs \" would be useful and relatively easy to reference . i * might * be able to reference a statement like \" x games tend to have more non - military techs than other strategy games \" , although i 'm not so sure . either way , i 'd like to trim this section down to what 's true of all x games rather than getting clouded in lots of examples . : imo the ony facts i 'd consider safe in my list are that in the x games that i know : there 's no dependency on specific buildings ; advanced combat units slaughter much larger numbers of less advanced units . there are too many exceptions to the other features . * the constraints section runs into a lot of the same problems as the technology section . i can definitely reference the individual constraints in each game . but i 'm not sure this is even useful . why are we going into all kinds of detail about constraints ? is n't this like a section on all the different kinds of health - systems in action games ? i 'm really tempted to scrap this whole section . this seems to fail any kind of notability test . i 'd like to get away from example - spam for the sake of example - spam . : here i strongly disagree . it 's very different from health - systems , e . g . [ wiki link : master of orion ii ] and [ wiki link : civilization ii ] have quite specific rules about how quickly units recover from combat damage , and they also have internal constraints on production and , in the [ wiki link : civilization ( series ) civilization ] series , about how war like you can be . in the civilization series discontent is a very strong constraint since you have to al locate some citizens as \" entertainers \" rather than workers , tax - ga there rs or scientists ( at the highest difficulty level every citizen after the rd is dis cont en ted unless you do something abut it ; that 's really severe ) . also in the civilization series , the senate can force you to make peace and prevent you from starting a war ( applies only to republican and democratic governments , it 's part of they price they pay for their advantages in research and cash flow ) . finally the last internal constraint in the civilization series is corruption : the further a city is from your capital , the more of its output is lost to corruption ( depends on your government type ) . in the [ wiki link : galactic civilizations ] series afaik ( based on reviews , i have n't played it ) : your political partly can be voted out of office ; since the different parties have different bonuses ( e . g . production , cash - flow , research ) this can turn your strategy on its head . in the master of orion series , once you al locate more than a certain number of your population to industrial work an increasing of output is lost because it has to be spent on pollution control ( the thre sh hold number varies depending on various features of each planet , and on your pollution control techs ) . in non - x empire games the only constraint on how fast you extract resources is that too many \" peasants \" get in each others ' way ( applies only to games with the \" peasants take resources back to the town hall \" model ; does not apply wi ti h practical limits to the [ wiki link : command conquer ] series , where you can operate as many ore miners as you like , provided you can avoid congestion problems ; does not apply at all to [ wiki link : total annihilation ] , where resources are extracted by buildings and the main constraint is the relative scarcity of metal deposits on almost all maps ) ; there 's no pollution , corruption or internal politics . my biggest concern about the internal constraints is that i 'm only aware of them in game series . others might know better . : ps might be a good idea to put this in a footnote - it 's all in the manuals , but a bit long for the main article . this article had a lot of great information to start with . by adding a lot of references , i think it can get to ga maybe even fa status . the \" original research \" problems are the last remaining challenge in my opinion . i definitely appreciate your work so far . response : thanks for getting back to me so quickly . a few things : * i 'll see about removing the reference to strange adventures in infinite space , since that 's not a x game . but the others will be quite useful . i 'll try to improve the references when i find time . good job on fixing the beer and pre tz els references . much better ! * yes , that 's the reference i 'm talking about . first , you leave out the part about \" the focus of the gameplay \" . second , the change in wording you 've used changes where the bar is set . the reference excludes games where victory involves any extermination , whereas your wording would only exclude games where victory involves total extermination . it 's the difference between victory tied to successful war and victory tied to total genocide . i know you 're trying to clarify . but sometimes a subtle change in wording can change the whole meaning of a statement . i think it 's better to defer to the actual reference . : i think you might want re - read moby games , especially \" . gameplay focuses only on extermination without any other possible victory conditions . \" - extermination is allowed , provided there are other v cs . * that 's extremely helpful . would you mind re - writing the section to reflect those two \" safe \" facts ? leave the references to me . i 'll post again if i run into any trouble . minor update ' : i may already have a reference for [ external link : rt ss and buildings ] . is n't google a wonderful thing ? : will do . the ref 's good news , well done ! * hmm , i see what you mean . constraints do seem to be a distinguishing factor between x and other strategy games . but i 'm having a lot of trouble referencing the over - riding context of the section . the examples are only useful if we can establish the opening statement : \" in most strategy games , the only obstacles between the player and victory are the opponents [ citation needed ] ; gameplay is simplified to allow players to focus on \" what matters \" , which is usually the military aspect of the game . in some x games , however , there are other constraints as well : [ citation needed ] \" . i 'll try to keep digging for references i guess . but there are n't a lot of articles out there that compare x to rts ( let alone tbs to rts ) . let me know if you have any other ideas . i 'd hate to lose such a useful generalization . : see my response to your previous post ( i do n't know how we escaped an edit conflict , since we 're posting to this thread at such a rate - oh s * , i should n't have said that ! ) - that gives examples , and they 're solidly based on the manuals . i suggested that response might make a good footnote . but do n't o vere sti mate the importance generality of constraints , as i only know series of x games in which they 're important - admittedly these are probably the most highly - regarded x series . in my last post i forgot to mention the se series , which also gets a lot of respect ( i forgot se in my previous post ) . discontent is a factor there , but it 's very mild . as far as i can see in se iii ' the ony significant cases are : newly - conquered planets riot , but you get can full productivity from them in about turns ; and your home world starts the game rather grumpy , which i think is to prevent you from cr an king productivity to over in order to build your first ships extra fast\n",

as the article sources seem to support ( see chris pi ra zzi and ju kka aho links ) , if clips of different sources , types and pars are to be mixed , the par needs to be changed by scaling , cropping and or padding . you can not just change the par directly , that will give incorrect results . : you answered yourself : you said \" . par needs to be changed \" . that 's it : when par is changed , it is no longer the itu - r bt . : i am probably not explaining my point well . my point was that you ca n't just reas sign a par , you have to physically scale de form the image in order to change the par ( of course cropping padding does n't directly affect par , sorry if i was confusing on this point ) . if you take a x image with par of , keep the image dimensions the same and assign it a par of , then your circles will no longer be circles , etc . when mixing clips of different sources , what is important is that the dimensions and pars are the same . i do n't see any reason why the itu - r bt . values ca n't be used , again as long as you convert all of your clips to that . - : it seems you were explaining yourself perfectly well . but i understand that the matter might be difficult to understand . i try to resolve it but let me explain a bit : nle - specific par is used in digital images , long since they are digitized . its pixels were once non - square . but more importantly , they had out - of - view port sections . now , all their view port must be rendered on the computer . they were sampled with a frequency that grants pixels but they are pixel in the same space ( cen time ter - wise ) ! the point of nle - specific par is n't watching them ; the purpose is editing them , sometimes at a pixel level . so , you see , image is rendered different ; com pu tationally - correct , not visually - correct , because you want to edit the computer data not vi su als . check chris pi ra zzi 's article on this matter , but i try to clarify it with some screenshot . not very soon i got mid - term exams but as soon as i can . : but s que e zing an out of view port image into a : frame is not \" com pu tationally correct \" , it is just plain wrong ! you have not explained how changing the par helps com pu tationally . i have read chris pi ra zzi 's pages , ju kka aho 's , the www . mir . com link at the top of this page , and others and they all seem to support what i am saying , for example how to convert between square and non - square pixels [ externa link : http : lur ker tech . com lg pixel aspect square non sq convert ] . nowhere in these sources can i find any mention of the \" nle specific par \" of . indeed , i ca n't find a good citation of this value anywhere . can you cite sources which support this ? a screenshot would be very helpful once you find the time . - : com pu tationally , it is correct . visually , not . you are confusing the usage of natural par with nle - specific which is only used in non - linear video editing programs . read the answer to your question for more explaination . \" video editing applications had to employ com pu tationally - correct nle - specific pixel aspect ratios for and motion pictures that were to be rendered on : or and : screens of standard - definition tvs . \" again , you can not just change the par without screwing up the image . as mentioned earlier in this very section , and are not : , rather they are a bit wider . if a nle tries to squeeze a x or x image into an exact : frame ( as these nle pars do ) , they are doing it wrong and will have incorrect results . i am not aware of any reason why they have to do it wrong , it is certainly possible to use the correct aspect ratio ( as adobe now does ) . : this statement does not contradict you . in fact , it is confirming your assessment : trans - par conversion do reduce image quality . they create split pixels that are to be re filled with whole pixels . that is why nle - specific par is used : to avoid this problem by handling the image the way it technically ( not visually ) is . : i 'm sorry , i do n't understand your statements her at all . can you please explain further ? what do you mean by \" tran - par conversion \" ? what do you mean by what the image \" technically \" is ? the image is not \" technically \" a : image , although these nle pars want to force it to be . it seems to me that any way you slice it , using a par of on a image is just plain wrong . if you open a x image with a par of , reas sign it a par of , draw a perfect circle , then export back to x par , your circle wo n't be a circle anymore , it will be an ellipse . if you need to convert the image to square pixels for ease of digital editing , one correct way would be to crop to x , then scale to x , or even pad the original to x and scale to x if you do n't want to lose any data and do n't want fractional pixels . - : trans - par is exactly what you explained above : converting an image with one par into an image with a different par without causing distortion ( or as you said \" screwing up the image \" ) ; without causing circles to become ellipse . this means the new circle will look a bit blurred but human eye may ignore that if rendered properly with certain techniques such as anti - aliasing . : by trans - par do you mean changing par by re sampling ( scaling ) the image ? or by just assigning a new par with changing the image geometry in any way ( as the nle par does ) ? : re sampling ? oh , sure . you see , your pixels change shape and the total number of pixels in width and length are different . but , the width and length of the image remains the same . this new image must now show the same image as before . it 's like a \" paint the brick \" game : a set of colored bricks are put together , forming a chunk of rectangular pavement . each brick has a different color . together , they show a picture . now , you are given another chunk of pavement but the brick sizes are different . you are to paint the same picture on this whole chunk but you are only allowed to paint each brick with one color . that 's analogy for how pixels are transformed . : now , you did understand something wrong : nle does n't distort anything . it is there to not to distort . : how can assigning a different par not cause distortion ? you are changing the pixel shape . - : because we are not assigning it to anything . nle - specific par simply exists . is it not obvious ? : here is how it is : we di gi tize an analog picture , say a i picture , to a computer image . we have read standards : we know that we must extract pixels with a certain frequency . we get non - square pixels with a certain rec . par , in this case : . we also know the tv 's display aspect ratio , in this case : . so we know how many horizontal pixels we get : in this case : . ( vertical length is already well - defined . ) : however , where are the horizontal edges ? we do n't know where the image starts ! we only know its center ! blame is on the old standards , yes , but what should we do ? well , the only safe practice is to go a bit further from the center . so we pick up pixels . but hey , wait , this way the resulting image is no longer : ! but owners of the motion picture do n't care if image is : or not . they just want their property in whole ! : ok . now another problem : what would happen if we display this image that is not : on a : screen ? well , it 's edges gets obscured . people do n't care . some tvs obscure more and some less they are used to it . but for developers and video editors , which are digital mechanical engineers and must make movie rather than seeing them , it is important . all the pixels must be displayed flaw lessly on their screen ! the image must be squeezed into : frame . since all pixels must be displayed , there is no choice but pixels themselves being squeezed and change ratio . : so you see : a group of people want entertainment and want pictures intact . another group want pictures squeezed so that they are able to edit them for those who do n't ! so , the picture par remain what it always was : rec . , in this case : : . but video engineers and computers see the image the way it \" technically \" is , in their non linear editing applications . they have their video editing application wear a pair of glasses called nle - specific par . : i believe i understand most of what you are saying elsewhere , and while i have some additional comments i wo n't bother responding so we can focus on the crux of the matter . to attempt to be very clear , a i image has a sar of : , a par of : and a dar of : ( not : ) . i believe we are both in agreement there . the issue is that you are making the assertion that a nle must display a i image on a : dar screen , even though you acknowledge that this is not correct and will \" s qu ish \" the image . but nowhere do you say why this must be true ! we are talking about a non - linear editing software application running on a computer . computer monitors are not limited to : like an old analog television . there is absolutely no reason a nle can not display a complete i image with its proper dar of : ( with no image area cut off ) instead of a false dar of : . any nle worth its salt should display and work with : , : , . : or anything really . would you say that a : source must be s qu ished into a : dar ? what 's the difference with a : source ? : i feel like we are just going round and round here and not making a lot of progress . at this point i must ask again that you provide a source or citation for your assertion that n les must display a i image with a dar of : using these \" nle specific \" pars . i would also like to know what n les you are referring to . for example , the only software mentioned so far ( adobe premiere pro cs and adobe after effect cs ) in point of fact do not use these \" nle specific pars \" ( although they used to ) and now use the correct itu - r bt . values . you still have not sufficiently addressed this point , if you read the adobe after effect cs documentation link it is clear that the itu - r bt . values are to be used by the software end users ( your \" consumers \" ) , not some \" developers \" ( which is who , adobe ? ) . if you can not provide valid sources i propose that this section be removed from the article . - : . you must understand that computers do not see video files they way you human see the video . they live in their own binary world and do not understand how can a x picture with : par can be displayed on a : screen . they understand nothing but well - defined edges . but you do n't care because you get your video right . so , the bottom line is : in computer 's ma the mit cally - flawless language , nle - spe ci fc : par for a pixels wide picture means rec . : par in our human language . with humans , talk : ; with computers , talk : . : this makes absolutely no sense . in point of fact computers only understand square pixels , and have absolutely no preference for : par over : par or anything else other than : par . - : . yes , during a video editing job , the image must fit into the screen because you do n't have the luxury of constantly scrolling it every single frame merely to see pixels of critical edges that , if are missed and not seen , can cat astro ph ically impact the revenue . : scrolling ? why on earth would you need to scroll to see the image ? i am currently writing this on a : sar , : dar , : par screen , i can assure you that i can display a : image just fine with no need for scrolling . again you are asserting that modern software applications simply must s qu ish everything into a : frame , but have yet to tell me why this is so . - : a video engineer do n't comp li an a slight squeeze because he gets his money and customers see a flawless movie . : if he cares about accuracy a video engineer damn well should complain . the difference between : and : is small enough that it will go unnoticed by the majority , but the movie certainly wo n't be \" flawless \" if it is edited with the wrong par , especially if any geometry dependent edits ( the examples i have given are a radial blur , or drawing a perfect circle or square ) . - : this especially becomes true when you are adding a d - rendered object to a scene . but if it satisfies you , i take back my \" must \" and say \" should \" . : that 's a start , but you have n't yet provided any rational or citations that these values even should be used . - : you can edit your videos in preview mode on four wall - sized : monitors so that you see details big enough and are not bothered by bolts and nuts of user - interface . : . no , we are not removing this from the article . we only overhaul , clarify and re - write . when my colleagues and i re - wrote this article , we asked a number of people to read it and give us suggestions . we spent weeks researching and what you see is the results . we did n't added nle - specific issue only to fill pages . we added it because we felt it is critical . if you fail to understand the article , that 's ok , i 'll try my best to explain as much as needed . then , together we can clarify the wording and add screenshots even if necessary . : i think it is perfectly within wikipedia 's guidelines to remove any unsourced and unverified claims , please see [ external link : unsourced material ] and [ external link : verifiability ] . i do n't know who your \" colleagues \" are , but this has a scent of original research . if you have \" weeks of research \" supporting your assertions here , please cite it ! you stead fa stly refuse to provide any citations for your assertions , and the sources we have available seem to refute you . i will attempt to provide citations from the sources we have already identified : [ external link : adobe premiere pro cs documentation ] \" when you capture or import ntsc footage with the at sc frame size of x , the d frame size of x , or the dv frame size of x , adobe premiere pro automatically sets the pixel aspect ratio for that asset to d dv ntsc ( . ) . \" adobe clearly indicates that they are using the itu - r bt . values of : . : [ external link : maximum impact research digital media group ] standard ( non - widescreen ) provides a frame size of x ( dv - ntsc ) or x ( dv - pal ) using appropriate rec . pixel aspect ratios . thus , according to the previous calculations , these frames contain a visual image which is slightly wider than tv 's : display aspect ratio . to be displayed properly in a : screen or window , the frames should be cropped by pixels on each side . notice no mention of using a different par to fit a i image into a : frame , instead they correctly recommend that the image be cropped ( maintaining the itu - r bt . : par ) if it is required to fit a i image into an exact : frame . of course , for editing purposes you like do n't want to crop , instead you should display the image in its correct : dar , : par . : [ external link : chris pi ra zzi : programmer 's guide to video systems : computer industry mass confusion on pixel aspect ratio ] what mis - ratios did we use ?

: the ncpcog does not need a publishing company in order to distribute the works of ash . if they are not making a profit and the versions they are distributing are those of ash at his death they are not breaking any copyright laws , which belong to the author until years after death [ external link : as per korean cr law ] . the reason the wmscog 's publishing company has not gone after the ncpcog and vise versa is because the edition that the wmscog has published must be different than the authors original version , which is still under cr under his name . heck , i could write a book and self - publish it if i wanted . i do n't need a publishing company to do it . and in most of the world , that cr would belong to me for years after death ( which is the standard term ) . no one would be able to make money off of my work . ash ( who wrote those books listed in the bibliography ) established the wmscog . even if there are other books that were personally written by him , it all belongs to the organization . for example , if steve jobs alone developed a technique , it all belongs to the company and not by the individual . everything written by ash is owned by wmscog . his writings are all published managed by the affiliated publishing company , melchizedek publishing company ltd . since you are just the third person , you ca n't insist about the ownership , and if you arbitrarily publish any of ash 's writings ( not that you would do ) , you would be sued based on the copyright law . news regarding the news reports , these have to do with the wmscog and not ash . should they really be included here ? : hi super fly . these news reports are related with the article . these sources support that the members believe in this person ; ah n sa hn gh ong , as their messiah . if these are unreliable sources and has nothing to do with this person , the part of this article ; that they believe him as messiah must be also deleted . wikipedia is not a place to judge a person or a religion . it is an encyclopedia that describes information in neutral point of view . it is my iron clad rule that wikipedia mus n't reflect an animosity of a person and a personal feeling of distrust . thanks . : nancy , understand where you 're coming from but , after reading through these articles , they focus more on the beliefs of the church and people within them then ash himself . that 's why they probably belong more in the wmscog article . now , if you can find an article or interview that speaks directly about ash and what he has done as the main topic of the article instead of a passing talking point then it probably belongs here . otherwise i recommend that they be moved to wmscog if they are n't already there . : hi super fly . the news reports contain the comm em oration of their founder . without these news reports , how can we know if the person 's followers or what they are up to ?

) says , \" sunday legislation . sunday is mentioned only by its pagan name , \" venerable day of the sun . \" nothing is said of any relation to christianity . no trace of the resurrection - festival idea appears . no reference is made to the fourth commandment or the sabbath , or anything connected with it . the law was made for all the empire . \" even the books published by the roman catholic church admit that sunday was not based on the bible . \" is not the observance of this law among the most prominent of our sacred duties ? but you may read the bible from genesis to revelation , an you will not find a single line auth ori zing the s anc tification of sunday . the scriptures enforce the religious observance of saturday .

we can start to throw [ external link : links ] about this issue at each other whenever you feel up for it . but this out of the touch with reality approach wo n't work anymore . where there is a lack of evidence , lack of evidence should be pointed , where there is doubt , doubt should be noted . after all , that decent reader said clearly where are the flaws . this page needs to be free , you are scaring ( and bullying ) good man nered and well intended editors here . this is not hegemony , my friend ; this is wikipedia , [ external link : free ] encyclopedia of humanity for humanity . i 'm new here but i 've read the last three archived pages of discussion and all these points have been discussed over and over again . : yes , guess we are all a bit tired of that hula hoop in ' , we talked enough , let 's start walking . and it is a bit uncomfortable to see this discussion as game of ping - pong between me and peter . guidelines here are very simple , so please , parachute in . : how do you get along within reality when your basic hold on cause - and - effect is so destroyed ( or maybe it was absent from the start ) ? thousands of points of physical evidence pile up on the side of an al qaeda planned and executed operation and , to top it off with such fin ality , al qaeda itself admits to it ! it 's as if love light ( who hates bush ) is walking along and finds his hair on fire . he sees a tall guy with an arab head - dressing running around a corner , throwing away a bic lighter . far in the other direction he sees a guy who looks like he must have an american accent talking on a cell phone . love light 's conclusion : bush is on the other end of that call and his confederate obviously lit up his hair with a - meter - long match stick . this is the level we are talking on . : yawn , you are absolutely right , i have access to unbiased and un filtered information , which shifts my perspective far from such which is presented here . it 's like this [ external link : particular clip ] which you currently have to download , since , at the moment , it is mysteriously missing from [ external link : google video index ] or us media ( regular occurrence , actually ) . and i honestly , do n't hate bush ( like the name implies i 'm more of a peace & love person ) , never said how al qaeda did n't do it , did n't started that issue about collapse times , never tried to vandalize article or to throw an edit without discussion . heh , all in all , i did n't do much here , but listen to your insults , and your arguments without arguments . all i want is my little [ external link : reference . ] . i 'm not even pissed at you 're little exploit , it is obvious that you have misread discussion here , and it is not your fault if you are so well misinformed as you obviously are . politically speaking this whole thing is far beyond damage control anyway : ) : all in all you keep banning and censoring [ external link : stuff ] , because there are no argument left . if you would listen , you would probably hear and understand the need for other [ external link : perspectives . ] : there is no rejection of alternate perspectives , simply rejection of evidence that is inconclusive , faulty or outright fraudulent . what could possibly make someone believe that an amateur video clip based on bad si mp li fications and low - quality photographic material would be more reliable than studies using first - hand evidence and a substantial body of experienced professionals ? : could we possibly avoid all this things which were only supported from my side , not insist upon in any other way except in means and needs of discussion . and if we would focus on those other things ( namely foreknowledge and missing - al qui eda - iraq connection ) then we would be focused on undisputed , well documented facts . now , i understand support summary style of this particular page , and in that exact understanding i see no need for discussion about how , and why , and blah , blah is related to invasion on iraq ( all those things that should or are discussed in inter linked articles ) . there is this particular fact , a small , factual sentence about the reality where us administration repeatedly connected events of with ( al - qu ei da har boring ) iraq , thus justifying invasion . now , why would such outrageous , deeply effective ( almost ( of us troops ) in iraq think war is retaliation for saddam 's role in , most do n't blame iraqi public for insurgent attacks lie with such disturbing side effects stay neglected ? \" as that already provided [ external link : link illustrated ] ) lie be ignored ? what exactly are we discussing here ? political correctness ? i 'm not proposing an essay here ; i 'm talking about one simple , true sentence . does one really need to illustrate irrationality of keeping a blind eye on such deceptions which cause nothing but unnecessary death and destruction ? concerning this particular issue , it seems we have a consensus against truth here . which just shows , in what a deep , deep . bush , this page is : ) . : the subject is not neglected , [ wiki link : saddam hussein and al - qaeda it has its own article ] . why do you want to mention something that yourself agree is unrelated to this article ? : quite opposite ; ) , i 'm saying that such particular sentence should be right here in \" domestic response \" or \" war on terrorism \" pieces , think it is fairly important , if not to us , then for the world . iraq is conveniently missing from article , while conveniently justified invasion of iraq ? how can one expect we can agree on missing planes , when such closely related link refuses to be linked to article ? is there an article called \" iraq - connection \" ? : as mentioned , [ wiki link : saddam hussein and al - qaeda the subject has its own article . right here : saddam hussein and al - qaeda ] . ( and there are n't any planes missing . ) : wrong , there are no [ external link : missing planes ] from your perspective . mine is different , i tried , and tried to find that particular bir die ( just to keep my sanity in place ) , but there is [ external link : none . ] perhaps you can show one to me ? but please , do n't throw those puny videos we all seen . anyway , we can talk about all that collapsing and plane hunting later , fact is , was used to justify invasion of iraq . why is this fact neglected here ? i 'm not talking about saddam and al qui eda , it is about and invasion of iraq , that first big operation which is missing in this article , as it never existed . this is not , you can not construct your own history . say , why you keep pointing in that other direction ? this is not a second hand issue here ; this has nothing to do with that other article . this is serious stuff that you choose to ignore for no reason whatsoever . unless , of course you are under patriot act , so you have to be careful what you think , write and speak . have you seen my remark in biased section ? : re : \" missing plane \" - that was debunked a while back : . the vid you linked is even mentioned . : that link is silly and self refuting , as pictures provided there showed so clearly ( imho of course ) . you can google on that subject if you wish , at this point of time \" pentagon issue \" wo n't be addressed by me . for starters i would like to finish something and note the fact how invasion of iraq was justified with the missing link to events . just facts . : well , now you 're showing your bias . a site that actually gives references is \" silly and self - refuting \" , but michael moore - style spin video clips ( ie pushing an agenda and rarely giving references or contexts ) are credible ? give me a break . : instead of s op h istic r he tor ics that site should show a picture of the plane which is still missing no matter what they say .

( it is not true , as some have said , that the term comes from \" cap in hand . \" see snopes . com for a good discussion of this . ) the term comes from sports : han di cap ping mean assigned some extra burden or weight . back to the birth of today 's disability rights movement : budding activists did not like having been ' defined \" by the social service system basically re be lled against the term \" handicapped \" simply because it had been assigned to them by others and , in choosing a new term , chose \" disabled . \" anecdote has it that judy he um ann led the change , arguing that \" others handicap us but we are disabled people \" this is in no way an exact quote but it carries the flavor of he um ann 's thinking . so , activists in the u . s began using \" disabled . \" as in \" disabled person . \" then a movement came along to change the wording to \" people first language \" so , it was argued , use the term \" people with disabilities . \" britain 's disability rights theorists and disability studies leaders reject that , and stick with \" disabled person . \" currently in the u . s . activists seem divided . this is a very brief overview . i will try to add more and flesh this out in coming weeks . we must keep in mind in all of this that the disability rights movement and its thinking is almost unknown outside the movement itself , thus , the debate on wikipedia over this entry . i will provide some links as well to read more about this . many people still use \" handicapped \" or \" c ri p pled \" or \" afflicted . \" none of these terms is looked upon with favor by anyone in the organized u . s . or u . k . disability rights movement . \" handicapped \" is truly de tested in u . k . circles . hope this brief intro helps . npov ? ok , so the title of this article is disability , but it does n't actually really discuss what disability actually is . instead , it seems very concerned with political correctness : what is disability ? how should we refer to a person who is disabled , or to a person who is not disabled ? these are worthwhile questions and should certainly be part of an article on this topic , but they should n't constitute the entirety of the article , and the article should n't attempt to dictate the \" right \" answers . for a good contrast , compare [ wiki link : african american ] . unlike the present article , this article clearly states that african american is a term used to describe a particular group of people . it then describes the group , the origin of the term , the development in usage of the term over a period of time , and so on . also unlike the present article , it does n't attempt to say what the \" right \" way to use the term is , or what the \" right \" term is to describe a particular group of people . instead , it simply describes , in a neutral and factual way , the history and contemporary usage of the term . etymology of the word dis a be ld can son e one help me on this ? i need to find out about the history of the word \" disabled \" . questions like when has the word appeared for the first time ? who used it the first time ? my mother tongue is german , i know about the word history of the german word \" be hin der t \" , but i would find it in tre s sting how it is in other languages . thank you for your help : i think it might be a good idea to look for the etymologies for the words \" [ wiki link : as th matic ] \" , \" [ wiki link : asthma ] \" , \" [ wiki link : disease ] \" and \" [ wiki link : disability ] \" , \" [ wiki link : disabilities ] \" and the euphemism for the [ wiki link : disabled ] , \" [ wiki link : differently - abled ] \" at the same time . i expect the same processes could be used to find all six . copyright violation the defining dis ab lities was extended with a cut an past ver ison from http : www . parks . ca . gov pages files av w - types of disabilities . pdf . that document has no gfdl message and it i suspected it does not have a proper copyright . reverted to a version of oct . merge i noticed the disability and disabilities pages are marked as suggested for merging , i could n't see a discussion already maybe i 've missed it . could they be merged ? i would suppose , personally , via using the singular form as the page title , in the standard way i think ? this could be introduced as \" a disability is . \" rather than \" disability is . \" if the latter more generalized concept is disliked by some as opposed to a more ' atom ized ' concept ? ( is that why there 's currently two pages ? ) . that distinction would still be addressed within the page of course . having left the message above , & having looked at the wikipedia merge guide , & with the merge suggestion tag having been there since october , i 'm going to be bold and merge the contents of [ wiki link : disabilities ] in to [ wiki link : disability ] , and then edit . if anyone objects please feel free to revert discuss . i 'm done for now i think , i hope not too much stuff left out or changed or added , as i say please feel free to reinstate anything of course . person with assist needs what is most objectionable regarding the vast majority of societal terms used to refer to this human and cultural dimension called ' disability ' is that these terms are generally used to negatively summarize a person 's entire being . i cease to be a man and suddenly i become a ' disabled ' man replete with all the assumptions associated with the phrase . hence the development of ' person with ' language , as well as the world health organization 's attempt to differentiate between the terms handicap , impairment and disability . i 'd like to suggest yet another evolution of the construct : person ( s ) with assist needs . the idea is to be more context specific . while i am not \" disabled \" in most areas of my life . i work , i ski , i play piano , etc . , i do have assist needs in specific situations . i have mobility assist needs , so i use a wheelchair . i have dressing assist needs , so i use a personal assistant , etc . i have colleagues who have speech assist needs , and use speech output technology . it may not be a complete solution to the problem of linguistic expression , but it is less all encompassing and more positive by altering the focus of the construct to the fact that assistance is needed in specific situations . just a thought . burt pus ch bur t pus ch am rehab . com quote glitch under ' social model ' the section ends - for this model disability is a political issue . \" ( p . ) \" implies it 's a quote from somewhere , as does ( p . ) but where is it a quote from ? i 'm removing rephrasing it for now wiki are there any wiki about disability , people with disabilities and people s cases ? ( prefer ly multilingual , as wikipedia ) . thanks in advance\n",

      "this is over there is a clear consensus of like - we want it as it is . ps we are being civil your just stubborn . : as i 've mentioned before , i agree that is correct in citing policy in the face of moving goalposts , bad faith assumptions , and a non - existant consensus ( in reality , a majority opinion , which means nothing in a discussion intended to build consensus ) that is , for some reason , believed to trump policy despite the fact that wikipedia is clear that consensus simply can not take precedence over policy . there is a consensus so the discussion is over . : consensus does not o ver i de policy . : curtis , you did n't help with the way you expressed yourself . : will , consensus is that policy is being followed correctly . that 's the key here - is not being flexible with the issue at all . the underlying im pu tation is clearly that considers the attendance to be a major controversy and should be included according to that . all policy references point to the footnote being the best balanced result ( [ wiki link : wp : rsn ] , [ wiki link : wp : v ] , [ wiki link : wp : rs ] and any others that i might have missed ) . that 's where the consensus is . consensus is n't over riding policy here . policy is supporting the consensus that the article stays as it is per bullet 's last undo . : the question now is - will let it go and move on ? the latest report the wikiquette suggests otherwise , and frankly i call that a fri vil ous report by a te ten tious editor . i think any admin who sees that report and then sees this will see that we ( with the exception of curtis ) have been percent civil and flexible . which is the reason for my opening remark . ! a ! : hold your tongue , gary cole man fan . hush up , w rest lin glover . you 're spoiling the \" clear consensus of like - . \" : just remember , disagreements aside , these editors understand consensus . for example , the consensus which previously proved that meltzer 's claim could never be mentioned at all , even in passing , discussion over , that 's it , case closed . : also , how can g cf possibly talk about \" moving goalposts \" ? as ju sta punk wisely notes , \" suggest we revert on sight any further attempts by to violate [ wiki link : wp : npov ] by pushing that view of meltzer 's that is outnumbered by miles . so - ergo - it gets ignored , and rightly so under wp policy . \" ahem , wrong quotes , totally my mistake . as ju sta punk wisely notes , \" the current edit per my last edit is the correct weight and makes appropriate mention of the claim per [ wiki link : wp : npov ] . all policy references point to the footnote being the best balanced result . \" it 's that kind of consistency that makes the process rewarding for everyone . anyone who disagrees is merely being disruptive and tendentious . : i am uninvolved to my knowledge on this issue . from what i see here , i see a clear attempt to build consensus . above we had a clear discussion of the issue and compromises suggested and a gradual view was established , indicating that a consensus has been reached . there is no defining line in the consensus policy that determines exactly when a consensus has been reached , therefore it is for the editors involved to decide . wl is incorrect , consensus may override policy , per [ wiki link : wp : con limited ] . i am not seeing any arguments that policy does not apply to us , but if so please provide diffs , and i will look at the issue . at this time , i have no comment on the issue , only the discussion of policy interpretation . g fc your saying the agreement i have of - is not a consensus would please explain to me what a consensus is because i 'm pretty sure a consensus is a general agreement . : i would define consensus as an agreement ( often an agreement to disagree ) achieved by taking all well - supported sides seriously , entertaining all reasonable suggestions , discussing in a neutral manner rather than beginning with accusations of \" opinion pushing \" , not discriminating against editors for trivial reason such as editing with an ip address rather than a named account , observing policy , not claiming ownership of articles , recognizing that people who are not project members may have valuable insights , being open to discussion rather than trying to stifle it from the outset , and ultimately acting based on that agreement ( in this case , everyone agreed on a footnote , so naturally , the information was added to the prose without a footnote ) . short quotations are completely acceptable in footnotes . this argument could be ended with a ten - word quotation in the footnote . for a quick reminder of how ridiculous this argument has become , take a few seconds to read [ wiki link : wikipedia : lamest edit wars wrestlemania iii ] . then add the ten words and move on with your lives . : we wo n't because the claim by meltzer is unverified . we 've been over that , and [ wiki link : wp : rsn ] effectively renders the current edit correctly balanced . : i suspect we have a different person editing under the ip now . ! a ! : you seriously ca n't understand that meltzer 's statement is verification of the fact that meltzer reported a different attendance number ? you seriously still have n't figured out the difference between truth and verifiability ? : what part of \" meltzer 's claim can not be verified by other independent reliable sources \" do n't you understand ? if it was n't for the fact that he was a reliable source himself the note would n't be there at all . it 's all about correct balance - which is what we have . that 's it - i 'm done with this section . ! a ! : i apologize for the tone of my previous statement , but i 'm just not sure if you 're trying to change the subject or are serious about not understanding what the word \" verifiable \" means in this context . based on the definition given at wp : v , the question to ask is : \" does the claim exist in a reliable source ? \" if so , the claim is verified . that does not mean that it is accurate . it simply means that a reader would be able to find a source for the statement . if something is verifiable , it should be included . in this case , both attendance figures ( , and , ) are verifiable . obviously , both are not true , but that has absolutely no bearing on the situation . again , i repeat : i strongly believe that this can be settled with a - word footnote . why is this so objectionable ? can we just end this it 's been going on for about days obviously no one can agree on anything so there are choices : . drop this completely or . just to leave it as it is . ( footnote sounds good though ) : i agree with adding the footnote . : it has already been added . ! a ! : just for laughs , i 'll ask the same question that 's already been ignored before . will ju sta punk , or any editor , ever go beyond the wp blue links , and cite specific , relevant policy text from within those pages that prohibits the addition of the kind of contextual info being disputed ? ( that is , meltzer 's not disputing the attendance until months later , and the data or methodology he used to come up with his claim . ) after all , if such a prohibition actually exists , it should be so much quicker and simpler to find and quote it than to continue this lengthy chat . : ju sta in vo kes wp policy to claim that the addition of that context is inappropriate . but ju sta was appealing to the very same policies two weeks ago in this discussion [ wiki link : wp : v ] ! [ wiki link : wp : rsn ] ! [ wiki link : wp : npov ] ! claiming that they forbade any meltzer mention at all . now , he claims just as emphatically that those links support a footnote , but only in the spar se st , most truncated form possible . as he was mistaken before , it 's incumbent upon ju sta ( or someone in agreement ) to demonstrate that his new reading of policy is correct this time . an appropriate excerpt or quotation of policy would be a good way to genuinely engage in \" percent civil and flexible \" discussion . : the version that 's on wm now is the result of inflexible editing . supplementary details contained in the claim have been removed as \" opinion , \" despite the fact that they come from the claim itself . conversely , eight references were added in support of the of fic lal attendance total ( which is not under dispute ) , presumably to promote the false april \" meltzer vs . the world \" face off that never occurred . the context - free edit is currently attached to the bottom of an unrelated paragraph about in - ring match ratings . : journalism uses the \" five w 's \" of information to establish credibility : who , what , where , when , why . after trying unsuccessfully to keep the who and what out of the article , some editors are now pushing to block when and why . if their response is honestly mandated by adherence to wikipedia policy and not personal feelings , i ask yet again : show us exactly where the policy says that . your responses are probably personal feelings\n"

( just kidding ; > ) * this is what the scholar [ wiki link : a . h . armstrong ] wrote in the introduction in his translation of plotinus ' enne ads in the tract named against the gnostics the editions . - a . h . armstrong introduction to ii . against the gnostics pages - introductory note this treatise ( no . in porphyry 's chronological order ) is in fact the concluding section of a single long treatise which porphyry , in order to carry out the design of grouping his master 's works , more or less according to subject , into six sets of nine treatise , hacked roughly into four parts which he put into different enne ads , the other three being iii . ( ) v . ( ) and v . ( ) . porphyry says ( life ch . . ) that he gave the treatise the title \" against the gnostics \" ( he is presumably also responsible for the titles of the other sections of the cut - up treatise ) . there is an alternative title in life . ch . - which runs \" against those who say that the maker of the universe is evil and the universe is evil . - the treatise as it stands in the enne ads is a most powerful protest on behalf of hellenic philosophy against the un - hellenic heresy ( as it was from the pl at onist as well as the orthodox christian point of view ) of gnosticism . there were gnostics among plotinus 's own friends , whom he had not succeeded in converting ( ch . of this treatise ) and he and his pupils devoted considerable time and energy to anti - gnostic controversy ( life ch . ) . he obviously considered gnosticism an extremely dangerous influence , likely to pervert the minds even of members of his own circle . it is impossible to attempt to give an account of gnosticism here . by far the best discussion of what the particular group of gnostics plotinus knew believed is m . pu ech 's admirable contribution to entre ti ens hardt v ( les sources de plo tin ) . but it is important for the understanding of this treatise to be clear about the reasons why plotinus disliked them so intensely and thought their influence so harmful . : hmm , why does armstrong think the se thians are un - hellenic ? i see why he thinks they are heretics from the christian and neo - pl at onist perspective . armstrong thinks that \" by far the best discussion \" is in pu ech ? ! man that text is from , and most of pu ech 's work is from - . i 'm not rag ging on the guy , but the scholarship had moved well past that by the s much less , or now . : well that 's the source armstrong quotes . hey juicy ze us y stated that he knows john di llion ! you know he could get di llion to clarify . yes . di llion is the rockstar of the ne op lat onic - he is the coolest . his [ wiki link : iam bli chus ] is the da bomb ! - the teaching of the gnostics seems to him un traditional , irrational and immoral . they despise and re vi le the ancient platonic teachings and claim to have a new and superior wisdom of their own : but in fact anything that is true in their teaching comes from plato , and all they have done themselves is to add senseless complications and pervert the true traditional doctrine into a melo dramatic , superstitious fantasy designed to feed their own delusions of grandeur . they reject the only true way of salvation through wisdom and virtue , the slow patient study of truth and pursuit of perfection by men who respect the wisdom of the ancients and know their place in the universe . : again that 's plotinus ' take on which ever gnostics he managed to encounter , which is probably just one group of se thians , from the names and descriptions that porphyry gives . even there we are probably in the land of polemic and exaggeration , armstrong describes it as an \" attack \" not as a \" description \" . - they claim to be a privileged caste of beings , in whom alone god is interested , and who are saved not by their own efforts but by some dramatic and arbitrary divine proceeding ; and this , plotinus says , leads to im morality . worst of all , they despise and hate the material universe and deny its goodness and the goodness of its maker . this for a pl at onist is utter blasphemy , and all the worse because it ob vi oul sy derives to some extent from the sharply other - worldly side of plato 's own teaching ( e . g . in the pha edo ) . at this point in his attack plotinus comes very close in some ways to the orthodox christian opponents of [ wiki link : gnosticism ] , who also insist that this world is the good work of god in his goodness . but , here as on the question of salvation , the doctrine which plotinus is defending is as sharply opposed on other ways to orthodox christianity as to gnosticism : for he maintains not only the goodness of the material universe but also its eternity and its di vin ty . - the idea that the universe could have a beginning and end is in se par ably connected in his mind with the idea that the divine action in making it is arbitrary and irrational . and to deny the divinity ( though a subordinate and dependent divinity ) of the world - soul , and of those noble st of embodied living beings the heavenly bodies , seems to him both blasphemous and unreasonable . - synopsis - short statement of the doctrine of the three hy po st ases , the one , intellect and soul ; there can not be more of fewer than these three . criticism of the attempts to multiply the hy po st ases , and especially of the idea of two intel lec ts , one which thinks and that other which thinks that it thinks . ( ch . ) . the true doctrine of soul ( ch . ) . the law of necessary procession and the eternity of the universe ( ch . ) . attack on the gnostic doctrine of the making of the universe by a fallen soul , and on their de sp ising of the universe and the heavenly bodies ( chs . - ) . the sense - less jargon of the gnostics , their plagiarism from and perversion of plato , and their in sol ent arrogance ( ch . ) . the true doctrine about universal soul and the goodness of the universe which it forms and rules ( chs . - ) . refutation of objections from the inequalities and in justices of human life ( ch . ) . ridiculous arrogance of the gnostics who refuse to acknowledge the hierarchy of created gods and spirits and say that they alone are sons of god and superior to the heavens ( ch . ) . the ab sur dities of the gnostic doctrine of the fall of \" wisdom \" ( sophia ) and of the g emer atio and activities of the demiurge , maker of the visible uni vers ( chs . - ) . false and melo dramatic gnostic teaching about the cosmic spheres and their influence ( ch . ) . the blasphemous falsity of the gnostic claim to control the higher powers by magic and the absurdity of their claim to cure diseases by casting out demons ( ch . ) . the false other - wor l diness of the gnostics leads to im morality ( ch . ) . the true platonic other - world liness , which love and ven er ates the material universe in all its goodness and beauty as the most perfect possible image of the intelligible , contracted at length with the false , gnostic , other - world liness which hates and de sp ises the material uni vers and its beau ties ( chs . - ) . i am also including the footnote from the enne ads here . * this is what the scholar a . h . armstrong wrote as a footnote in his translation of plotinus ' enne ads in the tract named against the gnostics . footnote from page . from this point to the end of ch . plotinus is attacking a gnostic myth known to us best at present in the form it took in the system of val en tin us . the mother , sophia - acha moth , produced as a result of the complicated sequence of events which followed the fall of the higher sophia , and her offspring the demiurge , the inf eri er and ignorant maker of the material universe , are val en tin ian figures : cp . i ren au es adv . ha er . and . valent inius had been in rome , and there is nothing improbable in the presence of valent inians there in the time of plotinus . but the evidence in the life ch . suggests that the gnostics in plotinus 's circle belonged rather to the other group called se thians on arch on ties , related to the op hi tes or bar be log no stics : they probably called themselves simply \" gnostics . \" gnostic sects borrowed freely from each other , and it is likely that valent inius took some of his ideas about sophia from older gnostic sources , and that his ideas in turn influenced other gnostics . the probably se thian gnostic library discovered at nag ham ma di included val en tin ian treatise : ep . pu ech , le pp . - and - . : the mother , sophia - ach moth fall stuff happens both in the se thians and in the valent inians . it may well be \" best known to us \" via the valent inians , but that does not mean that it was known to plotinus via the valent inians . as armstrong points out the evidence is that plotinus is reacting to se thians . the valent inians almost certainly borrowed from the se thians , did it happen the other way too ? maybe . : no that 's not the point . this ties into john d turner 's research . : please explain to me why i based my opinion on the most pre - emi ent scholars words and the introduction to the text in question and you claimed i was engaging in pov ? your supposed to know . i also would like to know who are these other scholars of opinion you mentioned ? and you did not address the works i included of [ wiki link : john d turner ] , why ? if you would like under fair use i can email you actual pages i typed out above . why have you not read the text as is stated above before accusing me of pov ? your a professor . you know i was rather light on the things i posted in the article and here i am being accused of pov rather then posting from a h armstrong and his own words and works . wow , wow ! : well you have certainly found a scholar claiming that the se thians were un - hellenic , which surprises me . it is a long way from un - hellenic to anti - hellenic though . : fair enough so there is a change in wording that needs to be done . secondly , you have a scholar describing plotinus 's attack on the gnostics , not describing the gnostics themselves . we all know what plotinus ' pov is . : bingo ! hence my request for you to contribute to the article . a refutation section is in order . if you claim \" plotinus believed that the gnostics vili fied plato 's ontology of the universe in the tima eus \" you are correct . if you claim , \" armstrong interprets plotinus as attacking the gnostics for their vili fication of plato 's ontology in the tima eus \" you are even more accurate . if you claim the gnostics were \" anti greek in it 's vili fication of plato 's ontology of the universe contained in tima eus \" now you are pov , namely plotinus ' pov . : now that is an excellent point . and a modification i need to make to the article . as for pov i was trying to reconcile modern stuff from john d turner 's articles with armstrong 's . the wording was misleading . further armstrong himself points out that there is every reason to think that plotinus was n't talking about all the things we mean by the word gnosticism today , but about a fairly specific sub - group of it . and none of this helps with the next paragraphs . so professor what i am supposed to do ? deny these comments and accounts made by armstrong and for that matter john d turner as well ? why did you state that only one conference was posted in the article ? when it clearly posted other conferences ? let me state once again i hate no one and i am not here with an axe to grind , so much as to post what i have read that seems to run sharply against the some of the or and pov of other posters here . i mean i pulled myself back from the pler oma issue and have not actually posted what armstrong 's prodigy john m dillon stated in the book and conference about the term . look on the [ wiki link : pler oma ] article . the comments are total pov and whenever any attempt was made by me to counter the points were removed . but what john di llion stated in that article that i referenced does not hold up for the article here on wikipedia . have you read his comments ? his comments are really not nice . this is just another example . i was hoping to find someone well read and in opposition to the camp of a h armstrong who could post more then speculative research as a retort to plotinus . as for other commentary not one of the posters offered anything from the ne op lat onic community . most offered other gnostics or gnostic sympathizer 's opinions not specific commentary on plotinus . something you could do as a c ri tis ms section . but understand that making statements like \" further much of the conference focused on the nature of procession , and on the role of the ur gy . \" which it clearly did not . plotinus was not a proponent of the ur gy and the controversy that iam bli chus caused to the porphyry was the first article . plotinus was long dead plotinus sets out no the ur gy in the enne ads or any of his writings . this is wasting time . : if i stated that only one conference was mentioned , i did n't mean too . certainly you focused heavily on one conference , and mentioned ( without naming ) additional conferences . : well if you can come up with other sources please add them . i mean that , what else do i have to go on ? this is the same problem i had with ze us no os and he was the one who allowed me to introduce the john d turner stuff because he pointed out the specific books and lectures on the subject that i had not seen ( in case you have noticed even though he is abit cruel i am fond of mr zeus brain ) . not that this means anything since i am of no sign i fic ates . i have certainly not keep up with the fights between the posters . they may well have been quite rude . i am not nearly as up on the neo - pl at onist stuff as the gnosticism stuff . : here 's what started it [ external link : \" plotinus treatise against the gnostics is no considered more a treatise against christianity in general by scholars \" ] and he insulted plotinus and my mother too ( just kin ding on the mother part ) . his only saving grace is that he misspelled \" now \" . but i can cite you tri parti te tr ac tate sections , that are more than speculative , in their retort to plotinus . i 'm not sure what you mean by armstrong 's camp . : armstrong and di llion . do you think that armstrong agrees with the attacks that plotinus makes , or do you think he is just trying to accurately report and summarize plotinus ' attacks ? : well i would put it this way . i do n't know . i know that i have both translations of the enne ads , armstrong 's and mack enna 's . they completely would support armstrong 's conclusions in my opinion . are there any other versions or translations of the enne ads ? i know that di llion 's is armstrong 's . i mean i tried to be very direct without pl ag eri zing ( ze us no os thinks that most of what i post in the [ wiki link : demiurge ] article is ko oky or pl ager ized ) . i , of course disagree . anton and pearson 's articles both focused on the ur gy , and its hard to imagine that b reg man did n't . ba zon , hancock , and pep in focus on procession , and i 'll bet its a big theme in ken ney , and mor tley too . plotinus may not have liked the ur gy , but that has nothing to do with whether the conference talked about it , or whether later neo - pl at onists talked about it . i am certainly spending time interacting with you about this stuff . if it is wasting your time , then stop . : stop ? now i have to feel out you intellectual types to see if you are going to let me be critical . stopping obviously would not be an option if i were seeking to make such a relationship . now would it . stop . please , this is a distraction . i do n't think i disagree with armstrong ( here ) , except on whether the se thians were un - hellenic , and whether pu ech 's work was still the best summary of the se thians gnostics in . : good point i would like to work this conflict into the article somehow . but i certainly disagree with plotinus , on a number of other points , where armstrong is ( probably ) accurately reporting what plotinus ' pov is . do n't deny what armstrong says , but report it as armstrong 's summary of plotinus ' attacks , rather than as the simple truth . : i agree . as per wikipedia [ wiki link : wikipedia : npov ] pov statements can often be made npov by careful attribution . : man i believe this statement . i am hoping that alittle \" cross the isle \" cross pol lination will make the article strong and professional . i 'm not sure what your point about [ wiki link : pler oma ] is , the page has no discussion section , the only things you have tried to change since are still there . : well that people are quick to revert without cross sourcing . was there a fight over two years ago there that you are still mad about ? : mad no but i can say that what i would like to post there i can not afford to have another long protracted fight like the one i had on plotinus . so much for the truth , [ external link : ugly man , just ugly ] . the page has the gnostic side without much of the orthodox side , you could certainly expand about how the term is used outside of gnosticism , or about dillon 's work on the history of the term . i 'm not certain i see the issue here . : hey lets move this stuff of your talk page and into the n & g ; talk page ? we can continue there without cl u d dering up your talkpage\n",

      "the web site where i found the information did n't specify , either . : while do dos may have eaten \" dodo tree \" fruits , there is no solid evidence they did . nor is there solid evidence that the dodo was absolutely required for seed ger min ation . you can read more in another discussion here : [ wiki link : talk : dodo cal var ia tree ] , or read this : [ external link : the widespread misconception that the tam bal aco que or cal var ia tree absolutely required the dodo bird for its seeds to ger min ate ] . i think that it did eat the seeds of the cal var ia tree because after the dodo went extinct the trees started to as well . since then another animal might have started eating the seeds , evolution all that , that 's why the tree is n't extinct now . understand these are all deductions . ( notice i like do dos ) lol used for food ? i just did a quick google and the first site i found mentioned that the dodo was used extensively by the portuguese for meat . [ externa link : http : www . bag he era . com inthe wild ext do do bird . htm ] : which is correct . at the same time , i would not be surprised if the article above was the source of information for our own article , so the discrepancy is especially interesting . : i was pretty sure that do dos were eaten . i 'm sure that 's what we learnt in school ! i 'll see what i can find . : i 've removed the bit about do dos not being used for food , they obviously were . - : jan , ( utc ) : they were not , they tried to at first but found it very horrible , recent re se ac rh has shown that they were not . a program on tv a few years ago showed they were not . - fon zy : fon zy , what was the title of the program ? it is difficult to trust a source which ca n't be viewed . i also saw a program on pbs recently and it claimed the birds were often and easily hunted for food . tv is n't always right : the same program also claimed the cal var ia tree was going extinct , which i have since learned is untrue . does anyone know how tall the dodo was known to grow ? : it could have been up to three feet . in the scottish standard grade exam paper of english in had an article on do dos . they said that the portuguese did n't eat the dodo as its lack of breast muscles made the meat taste disgusting . there were lots of other opinions , but most are covered in the article . unfortunately , the exam did n't say which newspaper journal the artical came from . i forget where i read it , but i recall reading as a child that , regardless of its horrible taste , sailors coming to ma uri tus killed and ate the birds anyway , as many had been confined to their ships for great lengths of time and , well , i guess being gross , un c ul tured swine , in the source 's words ( as best i can remember them ) , \" . sailors c ra ved fresh meat , regardless of its taste , so spurred on by long stays of maritime service and availability of only pick led meat , the helpless bird was doomed , and was hunted to extinction less than years after its discovery . \" i am sure i am not remembering the passage correctly , the parts that i can remember , but it would certainly seem to make sense . if you were co oped up on a slow - moving boat at sea with a bunch of j acked - up , restless sailors , with only \" pick led \" meat to satisfy your in stin c tual car ni vor ous desires for months on end , a turtle would look like a feast , let alone a large , plum p , slow - moving ( ? ) and wit less bird . : , june currently , major scientific debate on utility of do dos as food . stay tuned ; i 'll add refs as they come in ( primary research papers , all peer - re vie red ) . suffice to say it was n't , in all probability , sailors , who were more likely to hunt for [ wiki link : red rail ] s , [ wiki link : ma uri tian sh el duck ] s , [ wiki link : ma uri tian duck ] s , etc . escaped slaves taking to the hills , now that 's another thing entirely . cu old n't hunt de ers , found it hard to hunt ho gs , and would have made use of whatever meat they could get catch . some of thes e people managed to avoid recap ture for decades ; the report is from one of these guys . specimens there are no museum specimens of the dodo still extant today . i presume this is to mean specimens from an original , live dodo , correct ? : that 's right , there are no stuffed birds , so the images of the dodo are from paintings , not corpses . the last stuffed dodo was burned because it was getting a bit smelly ! : sounds like a good piece of info to add to the article . where is this museum , and when ? [ wiki link : ] : ah , you said it was burned because it was smelling . are you sure about that ? my perception is the goddamn museum burned down . the article is neat . i like how it explain the origin of the expression \" as dead as dodo \" . it seem they may also have uncovered more bones . see link : \" the last dodo in england was stuffed by english naturalist john tra desc ant . when tra desc ant died in , his entire natural history collection was be que athed to an acquaintance , elias ash mole . because of his ir responsibility , the entire collection 's condition greatly deteriorated , and he donated the bird to oxford university in , two years after the last living dodo was seen on mauritius . even oxford did not take very good care of the bird , and except for the head and foot saved by a far sighted curator , it was later burned as trash in . evidently the museum 's board of directors took one look at the dusty , stupid - looking bird and unanimously voted to discard it ' . \" from . i 've got a photo of a th century model of a dodo at if anyone wants to include it . : jim f bleak , it stinks the last one was burnt .

[ wiki link : wikipedia : esperanza e ] removed a great deal of trivia from this section ; who cares if there was a big bird movie about them ? preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by vandalism someone 's changed the extinction dates to the s . someone has also added \" hi mr carr ! \" at the end of the first paragraph ! reason of extinction according to this trustworthy article : [ externa link : http : www . am nh . org exhibitions expeditions treasure fossil treasures dodo . html ? din os ] define : trustworthy . ? if very well informed counts , the dutch historical material ( its been years i saw it , dont ask for refs ) says they were eaten by bun ches , ships went there to provision , and that it contributed to the extinction . ( also dutch folklore had it they tasted nice ) . i think it was noticed rats ( and pigs and other european animals ) killed the rest or remain . in these early journals . this is however not in this \" trustworthy \" article , actually quit te the o pos site , it suggest hunting played only a minor part . considering the impact of rats , pigs etc . that killed off so many pel ag ics is one thing , but deforestation seems sooo improbable a reason this article becomes actually \" untrustworthy \" . i 've read a text that stated that monkeys and pigs were the primary reason for the dodo 's extinction , and that humans played a relatively minor role . this book said that monkeys and pids would squash or dev our dodo eggs . if this is in deed the case , a vast majority of the article needs rewriting . however , i 'm not an expert on the subject , so if someone could back me up or correct me my possible incorrect idea , that 'd be great . numbers are there sources depicting the number of do dos at differ net dates until it became extinct ? : highly unlikely . that quan tative data was n't collected back in those days , particularly by sailors . it was more \" there were many gre ate fo w l les on the islands \" or \" a sailor spoke to me of seeing many score of birds , but we saw none ourselves \" . \" dumb as a dodo \" should it be added that the dodo has been ( probably unfairly ) stereotyped as being unintelligent ? it is also in the dutch journals . we can not judge as to how stupid they really were , since many animals that evolved seperate from humans behave extremely stupid and naive . however the examples proof they were not to smart . they would ( often sitting on a low branch ) not move when a pro ached by provision ing sailors . as i understand it , when they could have been well aware of the danger since dodo blood etc . would be abound . they also made a stupid impression because they couldnt hardly anything at all , not fly , not run , just sit on their branches and get killed . i think the myth of the dodo 's stupidity is directly related to its size and nutritional efficiency , probably you will find a folklore of stupidity around every larger pel agic species , certainly when it is edible , or even ' nice ' ( a valuable provision ) ; ) fas cin atingly thus i think the name : wal gh vogel in dutch may related to a behavioural habit or pattern in the bird , certain kinds of head and neck movements perhaps , that with birds typically car to on es kly illustrate ' wal ging ' , a regular spitting of some kind , or some such . maybe though they just looked extremely disgusting when slaughtered , or it is about the smell . that was bad since it was compared to wh ale oil . the fact they still largely provision ed on it suggest that dutch sailors liked fat meat , and perhaps they had a way to counter the smell , ( i think they smoked do dos , but skin ning comes to mind ) and no , you ca n't de forest mauritius through smoking do dos . apparently the dutch really minded the dodo ( food ) died out , they noticed both the rats and the slow reproduction rate when the dodo still existed . didnt they release pigs or goats after that ? i dont know , maybe it was another island . : island species often lose their fear of predators because anti - predator behaviour carries a cost ( missed feeding opportunities ) , plus the fact that without selection pressure neutral behaviour like predator recognition is subject to drift . : i expect part of the reason for \" dumb as a dodo \" is the al liter ation . \" dumb as a door knob \" also used to be popular , and for the same reason . : what about the slang french word ' dodo ' , meaning bedtime , or sleeping , is there anything in relation with the dodo bird ( i do n't think so , but it might ) . phylogeny please consider the notes on phylogeny at [ wiki link : rodrigues so li taire ] and compare johnson & clayton ( ) ( see [ wiki link : pigeon ] article ) - at least cy t b can not resolve the relationships of the indo australian lineage properly . so the phylogeny proposed in the much - touted \" flight of the dodo \" paper must be taken with so much salt that it nearly becomes un palatable , unfortunately . see e . g . their placement of \" gal lic ol um ba bec cari \" ( sic ) , which is almost certainly wrong . at any rate , here to copy 'n' paste is the citation : * shapiro , beth ; si b thorpe , dean ; ram bau t , andrew ; austin , jeremy ; wr ag g , graham m . ; bin inda - emon ds , olaf r . p . ; lee , patricia l . m . & cooper , alan ( ) : flight of the dodo .

term plans to use them . after days , the creator would likely have long forgotten that it had ever existed . if the creator would be inclined to recreate the same account ( surely only to be blocked again ) , this policy would not affect their ability to create an account with a nearly identical username , by having five exclamation points at the end instead of four , for example , or any number of other n once variations . thus , deleting these accounts offers no additional convenience to vandals whatsoever , as they can always create an account with a marginally different name . however , enacting this deletion policy will provide us with the great benefit of erasing many stupid and offensive usernames from the rolls of our user list . i therefore implore the community not to impose any limitation on the application of this policy based solely on the blocked status of an account to be deleted under it . cheers ! : actually , this strikes me as a good reason to keep blocked accounts : once we 've blocked \" on wheels \" , which we will do every time it 's created , we need never block it again ( and taking the effort to create it and failing may discourage the next vandal , which would be a [ wiki link : good thing ] . ) since an account with zero edits should be blocked only for inappropriate user name , this is , i think , the only question . : my point is , if we do n't delete these accounts , they stay in our database , and the vandal ( if inclined to make trouble ) simply takes the same amount of effort to make a slightly different offensive username . in short , if we do n't delete the account , we 'll end up having to block a different one , and will only increase the number of such perma blocked accounts in our database . besides , after days , hopefully that vandal will have found better things to do than bother wikipedia with offensive username registrations . however , i 'd be open to some compromise - suppose we agree to start with the oldest accounts first , as there are some never - used vandal accounts who have been blocked for years . knock out all unused blocked accounts that are more than a year old , and talk about proceeding with the rest after that is done . : i 'd be willing to simply add a note , commenting that there may be reasons to leave some blocked accounts , like and , in existence and perma blocked ; these may be as numerous as the indef - blocked attack accounts . : same rationale for deletion still applies . if vandalized and was blocked , the account can not be deleted ; if made an account but got blocked without ever having edited ( either because they never got the chance to make an edit or because they never intended to do so ) , i think it fairly safe to presume that days on , the creator of the account will have forge tten it ever existed , and will not go looking to re - create it in order to vandalize from it . furthermore , if the vandal does want to vandalize , he can just as easily create or . by leaving the account , we impose no extra work on vandals , but merely keep our list of users clogged up with nonsense . : i will add a note explaining that there is disagreement on this point . : i concur with ba on this . : to give an example of one of the two cases where i think it might be useful : is perma blocked as an impersonation account of . in this case , it was actually used ; but there are examples where such things were caught immediately . that should stay blocked . we do n't want anyone else picking it to impersonate the existing user ; and we do n't want some newbie picking it by accident . : that is food for thought - i can see a much stronger argument being made to keep blocked imposter accounts than to keep blocked or type accounts - are pretty much all imposters tagged as imposters , tho ? if they 're so tagged , i 'm sure we can set them aside for now and worry on them later . : not sure who ba is , but i agree with sep ten tri on alis ; deleting blocked imposter accounts just makes more work later . we 're not in a shortage of names currently , i see no need to go overboard . seems like it would be simple to make the bot software that is going to do these deletions skip over any account with a current block . : i presume he meant bd - anyway , my problem is that we have some really unpleasant and pointless \" attack \" usernames which would be great to get rid of ( and if they 've been around for more than days , it is probably harmless to destroy them ) . single login do n't know if this was mentioned before but would n't it be han di er to do this after single login is implemented ? many users on another wiki ( commons , foreign language etc ) made an account here to protect their name . and from what i 've heard single login does look now like it will be there in the foreseeable future . : wo n't such users want to trash all the individual accounts in exchange for a single login account then ? i concede , i 've made accounts on other wiki 's which i virtually never edit in order to protect this username . perhaps once this is implemented , we can have a notice posted on the other wikimedia projects for a short time to alert editors that old , unused wikipedia addresses are getting deleted , and the way to save them is to make an edit from them . : i assume there will be a way to join accounts . if so , then it would be better imo to wait till single login is implemented . it does n't seem that this proposal has to be implemented in a hurry anyway . it can wait ca n't it ? see also [ wiki link : meta : communications sub committees press pr sul this press draft ] . i saw referring to it recently . : well , i 'm not sure this proposal would affect anything for people who have cross - namespace usernames . either their old account will get booted for non use , or will get sucked into the new one . i presume that the single user account will not be deleted if there 's a single edit from it on any of the projects , but i also do n't want to hold my breath waiting for it to come about . my immediate concern is eliminating the unused offensive and insulting usernames created as a one - time gag . those should never be recast as single - user accounts either . : the only thing which could happen i think is that for instance the german equivalent ( famous admin name needed hmm ) tony sidaway has an empty account here , which he could lose if someone else registers it after the cleanup and makes a few minor edits on it . therefore making the account impossible to use for the german user . i have to admit that this scenario is not that likely to happen , but still . : there should be enough time so that he 'd be able to log into it for a certain amount of time , or make an edit to per serve the account . he came here to preserve his account by making it , i 'm sure he can come here to per serve it by logging in every so often or making an edit . : having a notice posted at every wiki project for a few weeks before we start deleting accounts should be enough to cover that concern ( although i 'd give obvious vandal attack accounts and inappropriate usernames no grace period ) . : all the obvious vandal and attack ac ounts of course can definitely be deleted . with all the other ones i still think it 's better to wait , just to be on the safe side . there 's no real hurry . : hm . how about if there was a way to check if the same username is registered on another project ? that way , we could immediately ( ) knock out the vandal attack accounts , and ( ) knock out unused no - edit accounts for which the name exists only on en . wikipedia ( which there must be a lot of , because my understanding is that en . wikipedia has orders of magnitude more accounts registered than any other wiki project ) . : it would be great if that 's possible . is there such a way ? : is n't there always ? i have great faith in the ability of technology to provide the solution ! : there 's [ external link : interiot 's single user login conflict checker ] but it 's pretty ( understandably ) slow . born h ji 'm thinking also about the scale of this undertaking . we 're talking here about deleting well over half a million never - used accounts - i doubt that can be done overnight . if we op ti mis tically say we 're going to delete , per day ( or one every seconds ) , it will take more than a month to knock out those that exist as of now . we must determine if we can set a priority order - the first thing to go should be any account that includes an obvious vulgarity or attack in the username , and once those are done we isolate those usernames that are unique to en . wikipedia and do knock them out in chronological order , deleting those longest unused first . perhaps we can introduce some other qualifiers like length of username or number of exclamation points ! ; - ) * well , we can always look at the [ external link : evil plans ] . [ wiki link : wikipedia : esperanza xd ] just a note : deleting usernames with or more edits . can not happen due to legal reasons . please read the [ wiki link : gfdl ] . sigh . : yes . that already was discussed here and on the project page though . : indeed , that is not what this proposal is about . implement ? this proposal has been voted on for days now , does anyone know when it is scheduled to end as there is virtually no opposition - with nearly a hundred and fi fe ty users voting in support and a mere opposing votes . just wondering . ' [ wiki link : special : emailuser lcarsdata ] ' : , [ wiki link : june ] [ wiki link : ] ( utc ) * i think a community portal bump might help us to hit - if we can say we got votes opinions in favour we can make the powers that be take notice . i 'll get bumping . [ wiki link : special : emailuser vanderdecken ] * we have reached . shouldnt this be closed by now ? theres overwhelming support for the proposal - : * closed by whom ? who has such authority ? i suppose someone would have to make a feature request , and then we wait . : i 'll contact jimbo . ' [ wiki link : special : emailuser lcarsdata ] ' : , [ wiki link : july ] [ wiki link : ] ( utc ) just one more point does the one edit count even if the person made the edit to their own userpage ? in that case , would something like be deleted since the user has only made one edit ever ? : just to clarify : conservative joe 's user page was deleted just recently . : two points - first , any edit to any page counts - this is a software limitation , not merely a policy matter , as unattributed edits can not exist ; second , it does not matter if the edited page is deleted , the edit still exists in the database ( and is viewable by admins ) . all - encompassing note in order to sa ti si fy everything about the gfdl and all : * no edits * no deleted edits * no oversight hidden edits * no log activity , except for new user . * no otherwise hidden log activity . in other words , there should be nothing about a user in any of the [ wiki link : special : log logs ] except for the username being created , including any otherwise hidden . the basic premise ? they can have done nothing that ended up on wikipedia for any amount of time except for being a new user . in this way , the original intention of ' unused ' is completely upheld . anything less will probably get tossed out . unused period there still seems to be a fairly arbitrary attitude to what the cutoff period should be , despite the proposal title of days . i wondering , is it possible to produce cumulative frequency statistics on how long accounts concerned by this policy have been idle ? that would give a more informed insight on how long or short to set it . i also still want to see a server admin say that this whole process will do the servers that much good . dissing the gis ? as a gi who occasionally spends seasons away from anything remotely resembling internet access , i find this topic - and the percentage of those who apparently approve of the proposition - discouraging . : please realize that this proposition is n't the slightest bit prejudiced against gis , or any other group . as discussed several times above and below , any user who makes any edit , even just posting a single comment here ( as you 've already done ) ensures that their username will never be deleted . this is a matter of both technical and legal requirements which can never be changed . the only accounts subject to deletion are the ones that have never made a single edit anywhere on wikipedia , and also have n't logged in within the past days . so if a gi ( or anybody else ) wants to ensure their account remains reserved even if they unexpectedly get kept away from the internet for an extended period of time , they just have to make a single comment ( like the one you just made , or even just on their on user page ) and they 're safe . : just make an edit to an article as soon as you make a username . that will cover it , and only takes seconds - : and , if you are n't in a position to make an edit within your first three months , just recreate the account when you get back from your mission . paradox has it occured to anyone that no one who will be affected by this proposal has ( or even can ) vote on this page ? : well , yes , but if you never edited at all , why would you want to vote ? basically this should not effect anyone , as all these accounts are stale , and would never have made any edits . : isnt that a good thing ? by voting here , people no longer fall under the cater ogy of inactive users , both ensuring their page 's survival and showing that they actually check what is going on in the wp community - : but if there is a valid reason that people get accounts and then ca n't edit with them , there is no way to find out about it . though there probably is n't one , i just thought it was an odd paradox : um , if you ca n't edit with your account , then you do n't need one ( and wikipedia does n't need you to have one ) . as my contracts professor would say , do n't lose sight , do n't lose sight of the fact that accounts exist only as a mechanism to assist users in improving wikipedia . true , we 're building an encyclopedia for the world , but anyone can read wikipedia , account or no . an account is only of use if an editor is using it to make improvements . : if they would not be able to edit with the account , how would that be able to create it ? all you need to do is make an edit as soon as you create your account , and you 're sorted . i dont see why this is such a problem . making a minor edit to your own talk page or user page takes seconds - votes over people have supported this now . is there any deadline to this , and does any developer actually know about this ? if not , someone should tell them . ) * i reposted this on community portal exactly a week ago with the ultimate motive of hitting votes . i was going to post a short about it on the administrator 's noticeboard or similar , but now i think i might leave it up to the original inventor of the policy , . i 'll drop him a line and ask what he thinks\n",

      "rlevse asked me to take a look - sorry it took me so long ! this is a bit of a mis hm ash of nitpicky things that do n't matter , questions , and more detailed comments . * probably too detailed for the lead : \" funded by boyce 's personal annual contribution of , the l sa bo asted a membership of nearly , although this figure was reported by lone scout magazine editors as being wildly inflated . \" ( i 'd just remove the sentence ) : rm 'd * it seems a bit out of place to mention that his divorce was on the front page of the chicago tribune . at this point we do n't really know whether that was a big deal or not , or why anyone really cared * the information about the ci gars seems a bit trivial : removed . * the house in ottawa is discussed as his before it is mentioned that he bought it . that seems a bit confusing * if the family was mostly settled in illinois , why did the first divorce take place in south dakota ? : it does n't say , prob because they spent a lot of time there and there are fewer people less publicity * at this time , did n't divorce filings have to have a reason ? were the reasons in either of his divorce filings worth mentioning ? * is there any information on how he became interested in newspapers ? that does n't appear to have a lot to do with his previous jobs . same with cotton ex positions . * what does this mean ? \" he insisted on the welfare of delivery boys \" * i 'm not sure what relevance the pullman strike anecdote has to this man ; on a second reading , i get it - perhaps a small reorganization of those two sentences ? * did he win or lose the suit against the mar se illes land power company ? * we are told that in ben got positions in water and power businesses . was that mentioned before that he owned those ? * any info on how he \" revamped \" the newspapers to make them more popular ? i 'm curious about what types of things his newspapers might have focused on ( i 'm not familiar with newspapers of the time period ) * was movie romances one of the first tabloids ? : yes , added * do we need a cite for \" there are several variations of this legend , such as one that claimed he knew about scouting ahead of time . \" ? * what are tribe papers ? they are mentioned but not explained . * is there any more information about his books ? there a lot of them , and i am curious how well they were received . * overall , i think this is a reasonably well - written article , it 's just in a style that is very different than i am used to seeing ( or writing ) . i do n't know how it will go over at fac - there may be a backlash , or people might like it . the current structure demands that the reader be familiar with the lead ( i often skip the lead and just read the article ) , and it seems to explain rather than demonstrate some of its facts . for example , the business enterprises section begins with \" boyce 's success as a businessman \" , but in the body of the article we are not told that he was a businessman ; the last we knew he was shifting from job to job around the country . the section then goes into a discussion of he compares to teddy roosevelt . but we still have n't been shown that he actually deserves to be compared to the president . we then go back in time to establish that he was a successful businessman . we are also told twice in this section about the newspapers he bought in chicago . * another example : we are told that \" boyce 's weekly , an international paper recognized as a defender of worker 's rights \" but not given any examples . what did it advocate ? how big a role did boyce play in steering the newspaper ? * scouting information is often repeated in the scouting sections , too . to me , this is usually a sign of potential organizational improvements ( for example , we learn twice about when the bsa got its federal charter ) * i also like to have personal information scattered through the article rather than all tucked away in its own section . i think it could benefit this article to bring the info about his divorce and re marriage to be inter mixed with the rest ( since it is referred to at any rate\n",

tom : ( voiceover ) because i sp il t red bull on it . computer : woe is unto thee ! amanda : why ? tom : because adam pushed me . amanda : making excuses ? tom : yes . amanda : why ? tom : gah ! i did n't expect some kind of spanish in qui si ton ! kevin : good day , employees ! i 'd like to welcome you to b - corp . as you labor here , do n't think of it as \" work . \" that carries a negative connotation that is destructive to morale . think instead of your labor here as fun ! this is your time to have fun , so re li sh it , or so help me , i will tear you limb from limb . ah - hem . so , in order to acc en tu ate an atmosphere of fun , i 've watered down performance rankings . though i 'd prefer to repeal them out - right , the board of directors is making me do them . so your employee reviews will be almost impossible to comprehend . so , before i send you out into the cathedral hall , just remember that i 'm your buddy here . i 'm an employee among ce os , so have fun ! oh , and since we do business differently at b - corp , you must adapt ! to ot les . amanda : do n't you agree that this sounds . strange ? adam : yes ! tom : but at the same time , fun , so let 's dive into it like fools without thinking of consequences ! all : yay ! scene : b - corp hall way kevin : tom , i 'd like to talk to you . would you mind accompanying me to the local charley 's for a spot of lun cheon while we chat ? tom : okay . scene : charley ' sk ev in : so tom , i 've been reviewing the work you 've submitted to me recently , and i must say , it is stellar . keep up the good work pal . tom : yes ! i have gotten on the bosses ' good side . slack time ! scene : kevin 's b - corp of fic ek ev in : adam , come here a moment . adam : yes ! kevin : could you file some finance reports for me ?

amanda : because that 's a logical fallacy . kevin : why ? amanda : because to ship an expanding amount of books we would have to have an equally expanding market . but the market is n't growing . we 'd have so much product it would de value and ruin the company . kevin : make me care ! amanda : what ? kevin : never mind , you have not established an eloquent voice on this matter . away with you ! amanda : she esh kevin : ( on loud speaker ) attention all b - corp employees , everyone in the marketing department has now been laid off . have a nice day . amanda : shameless capitalist ! scene : b - corp hall way amanda : so tom , how 's s lacking off ?

kevin : no ! you do n't get it ! there 's fun to be had ! look , if you need help i 'm available . seriously , i 've been announcing this over and over : if you need help talk to me . i 'm truthful . so many people used to ask for my help with reports and because of our joint - work , they improved as workers and as people . but now , hardly anyone is coming for a chat . what 's going on ? it 's time for a change , and that goes for all of us . i 'll be in my office . amanda : i 'm so di stra ught by this ranking and all the lay - offs . i constantly feel like i need to peek over my shoulder . it must be kevin 's fault ! we must get even with this capitalist ! who 's with me ? tom : you know what , sure . and adam , we know how you 'll respond . just do n't open your mouth . amanda : i hear by declare us the sister hood of getting even ! we will hunt down our capitalist employer and overcome him ! ( walk a little ways to an office with a tv ) tom : hey , look at the stock market channel on tv . b - corp 's stock is through the roof ! money 's pouring into the company ! . i have a cunning plan . amanda : what ? tom : we shall steal all of the company 's profit from this quarter , and that will render us even with kevin ! amanda : em be zz lement . brilliant ! adam : i can arrange for that . amanda : perfect , sit down at this computer terminal and start hacking the mainframe . tom , we need to celebrate when this is done . go to the executive break room and sm u ggle some champagne to us . tom : right - o .

( fall , die on ground ) scene : alcoholics anonymous mee ting kevin : so , that 's the tale of b - corp . let this be a lesson to you all . everyone must per severe in ethics , in particular work - ethic . you 've heard the so li lo qu ies . now it is your turn to act . what will you be ? will you be one of those who pushes the machine towards breakdown , or will you become a helpful cog and assist it in running smoothly ? you simply face pain and frustration on one side , and success on the other . which will it be for this machine ? you choose . as for me , i suppose my ethics were not what they should have been . considering what i 've done to b - corp , all those illegal operations , i should be one to talk . but then again , people can be changed by heart - ren ding experiences , so i seek only to preach ethics truly now , and not to make myself look good . oh , and by the way we still have some nuclear submarines that were supposed to ship to the central african republic . if anyone is interested , we accept visa , master card and diner 's club . it 's not that much , just a few grand . if someone would purchase a sub , that would be beneficial . hey tom i do n't know why . but i wanted to say hello to you thomas . - emily\n",

      "i did my homework and read again some of penrose 's writings connected with the halting problem . penrose presents the core of his arguments connecting the halting problem and related ideas to conscious understanding in section . , pages to , of ? shadows of the mind ? . the following summarizes his approach : although by godel ? s arguments no turing machine can answer the general halting question , we could speculate on the existence of a turing machine that does as well as possible in the sense that it captures all the methods that conscious being could possibly use . : does he say this machine is correct ( for those instances where it returns an answer , the answer will be right ) ? does he say we can know that it is correct ? i understand he goes on to prove it ca n't exist . i mean what 's the initial assumption at the start of the proof ? : penrose requires that the machine is always correct whenever it concludes that an algorithm does not stop ( i . e . , the machine is \" sound \" ) . penrose describes an algorithm that we know will not stop , but that st um ps the machine ; so , the machine fails to capture all of our reasoning powers . this argument seems to assume that we are \" sound \" ; one objection to penrose is the contention that we are all un avo i d ably inconsistent . in which case i do n't have to be embarrassed that i may be writing nonsense . : thanks . how about the second question i asked ? if someone hands me this machine ( which happens to be sound ) , does he assume i 'll look at it and know it 's sound ? applying cantor ? s diagonal construction , penrose shows that no such machine exists : for any turing machine that addresses the halting problem , there is an algorithm that conscious being know will not stop but that st um ps the turing machine . this does not mean that the particular algorithm in question will stump all turing machines , it only means that no single machine exists that will succeed on all algorithms that conscious being can analyze . penrose does not claim that conscious beings can answer the halting question for all algorithms , he is not even claiming that there algorithms that only conscious beings can analyze ; he is just saying that for any given turing machine there is an algorithm that we can analyze that st um ps that particular machine ( another machine might succeed ) . the implication , penrose maintains , is that the reasoning power of a mathematician can not be captured by a ( single ) computer . a possible objection is that , if one computer will not do the job , then use many . penrose addresses this type of objection and many others in ? shadows ? . : i do n't see this implication at all . for a given turning machine , there is an algorithm that it ca n't analyze . so what ? for a given mathematician there a lot of algorithms that it ca n't analyze . : the implication seems plausible to me because the argument shows that every turing machine falls short of accomplishing all that a mathematician can do : for each such machine there is at least one halting problem the mathematician can solve that the machine can not . so , it does not seem possible to model the mathematician as a machine . ( admittedly , my paraphrase of the argument is very informal and imprecise ) . the fact that machines can solve many problems that stump the mathematician is not relevant to the argument . : i 'm still trying to find time to put these thoughts into an article that wo n't make me blush . i have collected a bunch of reviews and commentary on these issues . sr wen ner if we say that most mathematicians disagree with penrose , then we should name some critics and present their objections , either in this article , the penrose article or the incompleteness theorem article . the last time i looked , i did not see such specifics . the electronic journal psyche published a symposium on ? shadows of the mind ? , with articles by many scholars and a reply by penrose : ( [ wiki link : http : psyche . cs se . mon ash . edu . au psyche - index - v . html [ externa link : http : psyche . cs se . mon ash . edu . au psyche - index - v . html ] ) . perhaps we could summarize the key objections and penrose ? s re join ders in the penrose article . i could take a stab at this , if you wish ( i hesitate to edit others ? work without their blessing ) .

      "i left notes in all my edits with name changes to refer to notes left on [ wiki link : talk : hunter c hunter scan lation vs . viz . translations . the talk page here ] . it would be poli et if you could actually read the notes left on the talk pages ( as indicated on all my edits ) instead of just ignoring the explainations ? the thing isi have read them . the problem with that is that it does n't make any sense to put them there . for example , the most ridiculous example is the change of kal lu to to karuto . we all know that every single child in the z ol dyck family has two \" l \" s within their name when roman izing it . keeping kal lu to as \" karuto \" is the same thing as if we changed kil lua to \" ki rua \" or ill umi to \" ir umi \" . the \" z ol dyck \" to \" zo al dyeck \" arguement still is inaccurate . do a search on google for them . z ol dyck clearly beats zo al dyeck by a few hundred votes . za ol dyeck seems to be the most popular out of all three ( and the one that 's the most incorrect ) , yet apparently you 've decided to go with \" zo al dyeck \" , the least popular of the three names . why is this ? : i 'm going to break your last edit up . i hope you do n't mind , this is just for ease of replying . since you 've made a huge edit and by the looks of it , i 'm going to make a huge reply . i 've copy and pasted your sign i ture so it wo n't be too confusing to read . : \" the problem with that is that it does n't make any sense to put them there \" are you meaning the fact that i edited my explainations onto the h x h talk page ? that 's what 's generally done when one discussion topic covers many articles . it just seemed redundant to post an edit explaination onto every h x h article i edited when it was the same article . : kal lu to karuto because that 's whats used in the scanlations , and because karuto is more popular . from my understanding , r and l ( as well as double r and double l ) are often inter - chang able since japanese does n't have both r and l . so kal lu to karuto kar ru to are technically equally correct romanizations . so both are valid translations , except that one is more popular than the other . using the \" ll \" rule as evidence is n't really counted , since wikipedia is pretty strict about no original research and no speculation . i must admit it was a mistake for me to add the ll rule into an article in the first place . : i think you misinterpreted the point i was trying to make . first off , not all scanlations follow \" karuto \" , as that is clearly the incorrect name . it does not matter if this is the most common one it 's not what togashi intended the character 's name to be . karuto just does not fit the naming structure , and if you 're going to write his name as \" karuto \" , then why are you not also writing \" al luka \" name as \" ar uka \" , when that name has n't even been confirmed yet ? it is just obvious that the character 's name is supposed to be \" kal lu to \" , and the scanlations in this case are incorrect . it does n't matter if it 's the romaji , that 's not how the name is intended to be spelled . sure , it 's a way to translate it . however , if you 're going to keep the double l in all of the other z ol dyck children 's names , then it makes absolutely no sense to keep it as karuto , even if it is the most popular name to people who read the scanlations . most people know that it 's incorrect , so this needs to be changed . : for a start , there has only been one english scan lation group scan lating h x h since karuto appeared as a character in the manga ( his appearance in york shin arc does n't count because his name is n't mentioned ) , so i have no idea what you mean by \" not all scanlations \" . secondly , there is no evidence whether togashi intended the names to be karuto or kal lu to , togashi has never written out his name in english letters ( as op pos sed to say , \" ging \" or \" ph al c noth dk \" for pa ku no da ) . the naming structure is fan - made , although it does work , it 's both speculation and original research , both of which being things which should have no place on wikipedia . so basically , there is no evidence that karuto is \" incorrect \" . it 's not wrong - i 've already said this , togashi never specified karuto or kal lu to . the naming system is speculation , and it works just as well if you replaced the \" ll \" with \" rr \" or \" r \" or just \" l \" , because they are equivalent in japanese . it is a fact that karuto is prefered over kal lu to , whilst all the other zo al dyeck children have the double ' l' . it is strange , and i have no idea why it ended up that way , but it does n't make it ' incorrect ' . otherwise , you may as well argue that \" k ur api ka \" should be \" ku la pi ka \" or \" cur api ka \" or \" cu la pi ka \" , all of which are also e qu il valent . it just happened in this case , viz also adopted a ' r ' as opposed to a ' l' . : as for kil lua 's surname , i made the page into zo al dyeck because last time i checked , that was what was being used in scanlations . i have to be honest here and say i did n't even realize there was a difference , i though people just used ' ao ' and ' oa ' inter chang ably . but alas , google test proves me wrong by a mile by showing ' ao ' is more used . so i 'll go change it if you do n't beat me to it . : that 's not the point i was trying to make . i was saying that both \" zo al dyeck \" and \" za ol dyeck \" are incorrect translations of kil lua 's name . let me show you personally . his name is spelled \" \" in japanese . this is literally read as \" zor u di k ku \" and its closest translations are \" z ol dick \" , \" zor dick \" or \" z ol dyck \" . these are the only three readings that it can be . now , \" zo al dyeck \" would be written like \" \" in japanese . \" zo aru do i ek ku \" . see the difference ? \" za ol dyeck \" diver ts the fur thest from all of them , since the first syllable is completely different from the japanese one . \" \" is how you would spell it in japanese . this one does not remotely even resemble the original term . therefore , z ol dyck , z ol dick , or zor dick are the closest translations to the actual word . anything else is wrong . : they are not translations . z ol dyeck , z ol dick , zor dick , zo al dyeck , z ol dyck . whatever one you want . none of the are translations . they are direct english versions of the name based on the sound . none of them , including viz 's one , are meant to be the actual romanization . otherwise we 'd be using z ol u di k ku zor u di k ku . none of them are translated either . they 're just what \" zor u di k ku \" would sound like to an english speaking person when it 's said in japanese . which makes versions like za ol dyeck and z ol dyck and z ol dyeck e qu il valent - because they sound the same . technically , the versions with just 'd ' instead of ' dy ' are closer to the japanese pr oun ciation . but something like z ol dick was neither adopted by scanlations or by viz ( and frankly speaking i 'm not surprised . ) another problem is with the inconsistency of the romanizations . some terms are left all in japanese , despite being in katakana . an example of this is \" york shin city \" . it makes no sense to keep the \" york \" in english , but not translate the \" shin \" as \" new \" , when it is quite obvious the place is supposed to be a pun off of new york city . not only that , but it makes even less sense to keep the \" york \" when it 's written as \" you ku \" in katakana . that 's translating just half the word , and it makes no sense . \" kite \" to \" kai to \" does n't make sense either . again , this is supposed to be an obvious translation . the name is even written in katakana , so even japanese readers realize that this is supposed to be \" kite \" . the fact of the matter is that the site is just using names that are translated based on pure speculation of what the name should be . it was just a shot in the dark in what the translated name should be to these translators , and i 'm really sure lots are n't correct . \" senritsu \" is the japanese word for melody . it 's not her real name it 's an alias . \" de me \" means pro tru ding eyes . pro tru ding - eyes - chan does n't make a very good name . \" blinky \" gets the meaning ac ross drawing attention to the eyes . \" k ur oro \" it is very clear that togashi wanted him to have a foreign name , as he 's had three romanizations that all do n't follow \" k ur oro \" . \" ch rollo \" and \" quo ll \" are the ones that make the most sense , and \" ch rollo \" seems to be the one that 's used more than \" quo ll \" . especially since \" ch rollo \" was used in a handbook released pretty far into the future instead of the th volume like quo ll was . \" genei ryodan \" is literally \" phantom brigade \" in japanese , and \" troupe \" was chosen because a \" brigade \" is a large body of troops . there are only eleven members in the phantom troupe , so they changed it to something with a similar meaning . : these are all good points , but there is no such thing as \" correct \" when translating names from one language to another . with senritsu for example , exactly where in the manga does it say it 's not her real name ? and exactly where does togashi make it clear k ur oro is meant to have a foreign name ? viz choose to use the ch rollo because that 's how \" k ur oro \" is sounds in english . : yes , there is a correct way to translate names from one language to another . it 's all in the spelling and pronounciation . the name \" kite \" is the easiest example of this . his name is written as \" in japanese . in japan , this is the word they use for \" kite \" and it 's pronounced as \" kai to \" , exactly as it 's written . therefore , the name is kite . : \" senritsu \" has some fairly good evidence that points towards it being an alias , but again , it 's never explicitly stated . first off , her name is written in kanji , not katakana . the kanji it 's written in literally means \" melody \" . if it were in katakana , then there would be a really high chance that her name would be senritsu and that would be it . but i think that it 's supposed read as the actual musical term \" melody \" , since she 's a music hunter . : if we 're not going to translate genei ryodan to \" phantom troupe \" or \" phantom brigade \" , then why bother translating the names of other organizations ? why not write the chimera ants as \" kim era anto \" or the heaven 's arena to \" ten kou tou gi jou \" or \" \" ( these kanji combined literally mean arena in the sky , or heaven 's aren a there 's no mention of anything that translates to celestial or tower ) , as it 's written in the manga ? you need to face that scanlations are not always correct because of the limited time frame that they get to translate . also , they take creative liberties as well with the dialogue and translations to what they believe the name should be . i 'll give you \" yor k sh in city \" , because it 's written all in katakana ( although clearly it 's supposed to be referencing new york city ) , but these other examples work . : there is a difference between translating a name and changing a name because of the way it sounds . genei ryodan to phantom troupe or phantom brigade is a translation , because it takes the meanings of the word \" genei ryodan \" , and replaces it with english words of similar meaning . there is no sound similarity between \" genei ryodan \" and \" phantom troupe brigade \" . : similarly , \" senritsu \" is a translation . regardless of how her name is written , the change from senritsu to melody is a translation because it 's based on meaning . even if senritsu is written in a way where it was meant to mean melody , senritsu is still her name in japanese , and melody being the english translation , the two are not the same . when you are looking at words like you ku > york or kai to > kite , there 's no ' right ' way . using you ku kai to is more accurate , using york kite makes it easier for the english speaker . neither of those options are right . : \" if we 're not going to translate genei ryodan to \" phantom troupe \" or \" phantom brigade \" , then why bother translating the names of other organizations ? \" because genei ryodan is commonly used , where as ten kou tou gi jou is not . kim era anto to chimera ants is a different story because it 's not a translation , just a change based on the sound of the word . i suppose by the same line or argument , i could say if viz bothered to make names like genei ryodan into english for the sake of english readers , why did n't they write new york city instead of york new city ? york new city was clearly a pun on new york city ? : all we 're doing here is debating back and forth about why individual names are the way they are in either scan lation or viz . nothing you have said proves viz 's translations are more correct ( or more accurate if you consider togashi to be the ultimate authority ) . and i 'm not even going to bother trying to say the scan lation translations are more correct - all i 'm saying is that they 're not wrong , but they are the generally used version . : also , togashi 's wanting k ur oro 's name to be romanized in a cool way is simply my observation and speculation . my reasoning is that every time \" k ur oro \" has been romanized , it is never in the romaji . i know that togashi must be able to at least put words into romaji . otherwise , he would n't be able to use a keyboard on a computer . clearly , if he wanted his name to be \" k ur oro \" , he would have put \" k ur oro \" . not \" quo ll \" or \" ch rollo \" . these are both official romanizations , and although they differ , i think ch rollo was probably the one he intended to use . : you think ch rollo was the one he intended ? why ? he never said it was su prior to quo ll , or that k ur oro was wrong . similarly , i really do think \" ph al c noth dk \" was what he intended for pa ku no da , but i do n't use ph al c noth dk , neither does the scan lation group who scan lates it , neither does viz . the names spelt out in togashi 's ' official ' ways are sometimes used ( like ging over gin , jing , jin . etc ) , sometimes not ( like ph al c noth dk ) , and sometimes debatable . as for quo ll and ch rollo , if togashi was contradicting himself ( as in providing two different spellings ) , then i really ca n't see how anyone can argue which one was togashi 's prefered one unless the guy comes out and makes a statement himself . : it 's got nothing to do with togashi 's romanizations . togashi 's roman zi ations are used neither by fans or by viz . otherwise , viz would be having hy sk oa for h iso ka , cur ar pi ky for k ur api ka , mati y for mac hi , and something along the lines of ph al c noth dk for pa ku no da . : togashi 's romanizations are incorrect because he 's not very good at using the english language ( or at least was not when he wrote them that was quite a while ago , so he may have improved ) . he tried to create romanizations that sounded english , but failed because he did not have a good translator with him . perhaps none at all . : \" troupe \" was chosen because a \" brigade \" is a large body of troops \" the key word there being chosen . viz 's names are not the \" correct \" names , they 're the names viz 's staff choose . and since viz licensed the manga , it makes their selections official , but it does n't make it any more correct . : checking various sources , the word \" troupe \" in english works as a synonym for \" brigade \" . technically , these work the same way . if you 're going to deny this , then how can you accept \" celestial tower \" for something that does n't read remotely the same way ? \" troupe \" is closer to \" brigade \" than \" celestial tower \" is close to \" heaven 's arena \" . viz just chose a synonym that works in the exact same way . if you need any more evidence , then here 's some solid proof for you : the japanese word for \" troupe \" is the \" dan \" in \" ryodan \" . the \" ry o \" in \" ryodan \" means travel or jour ne ying . therefore , ryodan in japanese can be translated not only as \" brigade \" , but \" traveling troupe \" as well . they 're synonyms in japanese too viz just decided to go with \" troupe \" instead of \" brigade \" . : i have no idea what you 're trying to argue . i never said anything about whether brigade or troupe was closer to the japanese . you where the one who made that comment . all i said was that viz was also making choices . their translations are not that way because it 's they are correct . it was n't so black and white . if they encountered two options which were equally valid , they would have had to just choose one option . and the choice could have been arbitrary , or simply based on which one ' sounds nicer ' . : if you find the popular translations a problem because they 're inconsistent - viz 's ones are not the pin acle of consistency either . viz translates some names when they can match up english meanings to it ( regardless of whether togashi intended them to or not . a name could have a english translation simply because many japanese names do have meanings . ) viz changes some names depending on sound ( i . e . kai to > kite ) , and some on meaning . some like ch rollo may be because they thought that 's what togashi wanted , but quite clearly , what togashi wanted is not a priority because we do n't have names like hy sk oa or mati y . : saying that togashi 's romanizations are n't a priority is a groundless statement that had to have been said without thinking it through fully . here 's a simple way of looking at i tif a name in hunter x hunter is written in kanji and is n't an actual name in japan , the reader is obviously supposed to know the meaning of the name to associate it with the character . senritsu , or melody , is pretty big proof of this . if a character 's name is in katakana , but also the word has meaning in katakana in japan , their name is supposed to be the direct foreign word that it comes from . i suppose this is debatable , but it 's true for nearly every character . and other names are just romanized by togashi himself . unlike what you say , it is a pri or ti y . otherwise , people would probably translate gon 's name as \" gon freaks \" instead of \" f re ec ss \" . \" ging \" would be \" jin \" to everyone . \" kil lua \" would be \" ki rua \" . \" le orio \" would be \" re orio \" . do you see where i 'm going with this ? togashi 's romanizations generally are important , and just because he screwed up with a few does not mean that all of them should be taken with a grain of salt . : most of them are screwed up . the ones which are not have mostly be adopted , by both scanlations and viz . the ones that are screwed up obviously are n't a priority - that much is obvious , since they 're not used by fans , or by scan lators , or by viz . in other words , they 're not used by anyone . : all you 've done is listed off reasons for viz 's name changes , and i 'm sure viz does have reasons . but i can as easily list off reasons for the scan l ator 's changes . york shin , for example , was n't a \" translation \" at all . you ku is simply the japanese word to pronounce \" york \" . \" you ku \" itself is not a japanese word , therefore it 's clear the word was made up . so it was changed to york because the word was mim i king the english word york . where as shin is a real japanese word , changing it to \" new \" would be translating the name based on meaning , which is not generally done in scanlations . : there is no evidence viz 's ones are better or sticking to togashi more . : um , the word \" you ku \" was not made up . that 's actually how the japanese write \" york \" in the word \" new york \" . the pronounciation is the exact same as the way it 's written . it 's not as if you write \" new york \" in english if you 're talking about it in j ap ane se that would be silly . it 's written as \" \" and pronounced \" ny uu you ku \" . the word \" shin \" means \" new \" , but had he written that in kanji or hiragana , it would be in different context . \" \" means \" the new york \" , talking as if it were literally something new , like a new bicycle . \" \" means \" yor knew \" , and not literally as if it were something new . it 's read as \" you kush in \" in japanese , but it 's supposed to be understood as \" yor knew \" in japan as well . this is a very obvious reference , and i 'm sure that at least of all readers of hunter x hunter in japan realized this at the first reference . : oh , and if you 're going to try and say that the viz translations are no better at sticking to togashi than scanlations , then maybe you should ask someone with at least some knowledge of the language . : . i meant \" you ku \" was not a j ap nese word in that it 's an imported word , not that it was made up for h x h . the word you ku does n't actually mean york , it simply sounds like york . so it 's just \" york \" , except re - written so it 's easier for japanese people to pronounce . \" emission \" to \" emitter \" is a pointless change an emitter is a person who can emit something . it 's a form of the word \" emission \" , and it 's useless to put it in parenthesis next to the original term . same goes for specialization and manipulation . viz actually has used both . \" ba ise \" to \" ve ze \" does n't make sense . the name was written as \" ba ise \" , and i ca n't see why it was changed in the scan lation version but not the translation . : if you consider it a pointless change , then why not just keep it as emission ? i for one , do n't consider it as pointless . emitter is a noun , it refers to a person . emission as a nen type is an adjective - it de sc ri bs a form of nen . changing all the nen names , even if we use the scan lation ones , to nouns means re - writing sentences . and a person using emission has always been referred to as \" an emission type nen user \" and not \" emitter \" . the main reason for changing the nen types , however , is because there are some differences . like reinforcement en h anc er , and transformation trans mu ter . so if i 'm going to change the names back to scan lation names , i ca n't well keep half of them as nouns and the other half changed can i . : that 's the thing the japanese names for the nen types have interchangeable translations . the japanese word for \" enhancement \" , k you ka , is the exact same word for \" reinforce \" as well . same thing with \" transformation \" and \" transmutation \" . they 're interchangeable . since an official source has translated them like this , it makes a lot more sense to write the english name before the scan lated translation because that 's how it 's listed in the states . only in scanlations and fan subs are they listed as \" reinforcement \" and \" transformation \" . : \" emitter \" is less of a mouth ful than \" emission type nen user \" ( a literal translation , but it 's less large in japanese ) , especially since the japanese way of writing it is tiny in comparison . if you wrote \" emission type nen user \" in a translation of the manga , you would either need to extend the text box or reduce the text size . these two terms are interchangeable and mean the exact same thing . : you see , at the end , you 're argument still comes down to the fact that it 's better to write the english as how the \" official source has translated them \" instead of how scan lators translate them . you say k you ka is both enhancement and reinforce equally , so at the end , the only difference is the fact that one is official and the other is not . : which is exactly the point i 'm trying to make - the only real difference used by the translations between the scan lators and viz ( in the case of names which are translated - not things like de me - chan to blinky , where de me - chan is non - translated and blinky is translated ) is that one is an official source and the other is not . even if google proves that the scan lated translations are more popular , that still does not necessarily mean they are correct . in all of the cases above , the viz translation has been more accurate and faithful to the original japanese spellings . it 's understandable , since they spend a lot more time on the product than scan lators do . there are even more cases as well that i still have n't listed . even the nen types , although the names can be interchangeable throughout both versions , work just as well in the viz version . the point i 'm trying to make is that it makes little sense to go with a more popular fan translation , despite if it is correct or not . what if the h x h anime was licensed here and they used the viz names ? then , more fans would prefer the english translation . would we change it then ? or would we still cater to the fans who got their information through illegal means ? i still do not see the logic in choosing a more popular name if fans like it better than what it is supposed to be . let 's say i write a letter to viz on their translating pro ces sif i came up with some hard evidence that they consult jump themselves and spend lots of time on translating the h x h manga correctly , then would we still keep the names that are more popular ? or the correct ones ? : for a start , a lot of these names are a matter of either keeping the original japanese or adopting a translation . it just happens that it 's much more of a rule am oun gst scan lators to keep japanese names than am oun gst manga companies . take a look at [ wiki link : us agi tsu kino ] . all official english versions translate her name into serena tsu kino . but the japanese ( which is also what people in the scan lation community use ) is used for the wikipedia article . : this example is invalid . serena is a name change , not a name translation . there 's a difference . name changes are when there 's a blatant difference between the original name and the japanese name . especially changes in pronounciation ( which is actually occuring on the z ol dyck family page for the last time , za ol dyeck and zo al dyeck are completely not acceptable as translations of his last name ) , flipping letters around , or changing the name completely . this is n't the case for any h x h character ( except maybe ku ro top i ) , simply because you 're doing the exact same thing the du bbing company for sailor moon did to those character names . only you 're trying to justify it because you 're used to it and that 's what your fan subs say , so they must be correct . i 've provided more than enough reasons as to why most of the hunter x hunter names in scanlations are incorrect , and also how viz 's translations come the closest to the original romaji and pronounciation ( except for terms you leave untranslated on here like \" genei ryodan \" ) . : the point of citing the serena example was to show the a japanese name takes preference over an english one . so de me - chan being japanese takes preference over blinky , which is english . i 've never tried to prove the scanlations names to be correct . i 've never claimed those names are correct - in terms of correct - ness of translation , my stand is still that there is no such thing as \" correct \" when translating proper nouns ( names ) from one language to another . which is what i 've been saying all along . my justification for using those names on wikipedia is that they are the commonly used ones . and almost all the guild lines on naming conventions , as well as the ones specific to anime manga , show we use names which are generally used . this has nothing to do with getting things right , or accuracy - since name changes are not a factual thing . : give me something other than \" fans prefer this name \" , because that 's completely ir relavent to the factual basis of an article . just because fans prefer \" za ol dyeck \" does not make it correct or even close to the original katakana writing of the name . if you 're unable to do this , then there should not be any reason as to why we should not change to the viz names . : there is nothing other than the fact that the those names are prefered . the names themselves are ir relavant to the factual basis of the article . how to spell a name that 's imported from another language , and how to translate proper nouns is not a matter of fact . viz chooses names they prefer , similar to the scan lators . viz has their priorities regarding what names are most suitable , the scan lators have theirs . i ca n't , and wont ' bother trying , to provide another reason because there 's no need to do so . it 's clear the scan l ator versions are more popular , and the guild lines make it clear for us to use the generally accepted names . : names like senritsu and de me - chan would stay regardless because they are the japanese names . unless senritsu and de me - chan become names which are rarely used am oun gst english fans , and melody and blinky become names which are commonly used am oun gst english fans . same goes for k ur oro and genei ryodan , both being the original japanese names . : okay , if we follow that logic , then gon 's name should stay \" gon fu ri i kus u \" . and k ur oro 's full name should be \" k ur oro rus hi ru fur u \" . this arguement makes no sense . \" senritsu \" and \" de me - chan \" are not real japanese names . \" senritsu \" is the word for \" melody \" in japan . \" de me \" is in reference to the eyes , and \" chan \" is just a suffix that works as a nickname that has absolutely no equivalent in the english language . \" heaven 's arena \" should be \" ten kou tou gi jou \" . \" greed island \" should be \" gu ri ido air ando \" . : once again , this arguement is ridiculous . you 're translating only some terms while leaving others untranslated . it makes absolutely zero sense to translate half of a word and not do the other when working with another language , unless it is intentional . quite obviously , it was n't intentional . japanese fans understand \" genei ryodan \" as \" phantom brigade \" . it makes complete sense to them because it 's in their native language . \" genei ryodan \" is not in the english dictionary . no one knows what it means unless they look it up . : yes , i suppose it should be . gee i wonder why \" gon fu ri i kus u \" is used neither by scan lators or by viz ? same goes for \" rus hi ru fur u \" for lucifer . there is no obvious reason for it , and i 'm not going into an arguement about it since it 's ir ri ev al nt - both scan lators and viz do not use lucifer over rus hi ri fur u . however , for os me thing like senritsu to melody - melody is clearly an english translation . similarly , blinky is obviously an english translation . : as for debatable names like york shin city , i 'd suspect it will be under heavy debate . if it because more popular and there were people advocating both for keeping it and for changing it to york new . i was under the impression that wikipedia was about accuracy , not about whether or not a fan likes the name better because of the way it is written . if this truly is supposed to be an online encyclopedia , then perhaps we need to make some changes in terms of if the content is correct or not . : but the problem is , neither is \" correct \" . offical does not mean correct . \" genei ryodan \" is very much the correct name in japanese - after all , that 's what togashi used . the question is whether viz 's translation is deemed as correct in english as togashi 's ones are in japanese . : as for it being an encyclopedia - yes , that 's why viz 's names are included and ac kno l wedge in the articles . if you feel there needs to be more in the articles explaining viz 's translations , then feel free to add them in . but the actual names used in the article is a matter of format , or style . and wikipedia deals with it by the various \" manual of style \" guild lines which we have . : this is akin to how articles about living organisms are named by their commonly - used popular names over their scientifically - correct latin names . ( although all accurate information about scientific taxonomy about a species is included in the actual article ) : once again , if you 're choosing not to translate one term for an organization , then you might as well not do it for all the others . it makes no sense other than you like the name \" genei ryodan \" better because it sounds more awesome to you . that 's not a valid reason as to why we should write it as \" genei ryodan \" . the arguement with living organisms makes no sense either . let me put it into terms you may recognize . the difference here is that you 're not using the original names for everything , nor are you translating everything . you 're using fan subs and scanlations as your only source of information without even checking the original japanese source material , trying to translate , or even attempt to understand search why viz would use these translations instead of the ones you 're familiar with in scanlations . here 's a fact : your scanlations are not correct . karuto is not what his name is intended to be . gon 's last name is officially spelled as f re ec ss . kil lua 's last name is not , nor will it ever be , zo al dyeck or za ol dyeck . that was a translation error . check all of the other errors . actually read and think about what i 'm saying . : you seem to be quite familiar with sailor moon . what you 're doing to ch rollo lucifer is akin to writing her name as se ira a moon . you 're not translating sailor , but you translate the word \" moon \" . what you 're doing to kil lua 's last name is like if you wrote sailor gal ax ia 's name as \" sailor gar ak she ya \" because the katakana has it as \" gar ak us hia \" . sure , these are extremes that you are unlikely to get wrong . but it 's just the same way . what you 're doing to the phantom troupe by not translating their name at all is as if you wrote queen ne hel len ia 's name as \" jou ou ne he ren ia \" . at least consider what i 'm saying , because it all makes more sense than what 's happening on the pages right now . : and i think what you are saying is wrong . all those facts you mentioned . the only one that is actually a fact is the \" gon 's last name is officially spelled as f re ec ss \" . so at the end , it still comes down to what is official . fan subs was never in the equation . i 'm not using scanlations as the only source of information - i judged which names where more popular by which ones everyone uses , that includes h x h forums , h x h communities , and the sites that were used as references in writing the articles . i understand why viz uses those translations , but i do n't agree . i 'd say if anything , you do n't try to understand why scan lators use their translations . but clearly , you do n't seem to care - because scan lators are unofficial and that alone is a bad thing to you . anyhow , this discussion is getting us no where . we 're arguing on different tang ents . you are trying to prove viz 's naming is correct and better . i 'm do n't care whether viz 's translations are more correct because i believe there 's no such thing as correct when it comes to translating proper nouns . if you do n't mind , i 'd like to move this entire discussion over to the h x h talk page ( as in copy and past the whole lot over , or at least continue the discussion over there ) . this would allow other people to join in the debate ( not that they ca n't here , but i doubt there 're anyone else interested in the h x h articles who just happens to also be watching my talk page ) . ( also , i 've changed the indenting completely . when you cut into my comments , please remember to copy and past my sign i ture to the end of the comment you cut in , and change the indenting somehow to show you 've cut in . otherwise , it becomes really difficult for me to work out where my comments stop and yours begin\n",

      "shadow deputy pm \" , again obviously , there has been an \" edit war \" over the issue of harriet harman 's political roles as well as the time she took over from john prescott . let me make a few things very clear , she is the shadow deputy prime minister for several reasons . firstly , you can not use a title unless you have been given it by the leader of your party . ed miliband has made her shadow deputy prime minister , otherwise it would not be on her website . she has no right to give herself a title unless it 's been allowed . therefore , i think it is fair to conclude that from that point , she is shadow deputy pm . deputy leader of the opposition is not a clear title , though she is deputy leader of the opposition , it is not a formal title it is just because she is the deputy leader of the labour party . for example , william hague was made senior member of the shadow cabinet , but he never recieved the title deputy leader of the opposition , even though he was the de facto deputy . on the point , about khan . he shadows clegg regarding the con sti tu ion and that is because labour thinks the mo j should deal with the constitution whereas the government has made nick clegg the de facto minister for constitutional reform , instead of leaving it to ken clarke . : first , no one knows the point you are trying to make regarding prescott . harman took over as deputy leader at the same time brown took over as leader , so there is no reason why blair should be listed . : second , it is no secret that khan 's shadowing clegg in regards to his political and constitutional reform portfolio . what you fail to grasp is that is part of the role of the shadow deputy prime minister . that is why khan 's team and others question him on political and constitutional reform issues at \" deputy prime minister 's questions \" , not \" political and constitutional reform \" , or even cabinet office , questions . : third , you say that since a person can not claim a title that they do n't genuinely given , and since harman calls herself shadow deputy prime minister , she was therefore given the title . the premise is flawed . there is nothing to stop her from calling herself \" shadow deputy prime minister \" to describe her role holding the dpm to account . it is also not true that a person can not claim a title she does n't have . of course someone can ; it is absurd to suggest otherwise . given that she was upset that gordon brown did n't appoint her deputy prime minister and give her a better portfolio when he was leader , she is exactly the sort of person who would stretch a bit and call herself something she is n't , as long as it 's close . : third , a flawed argument from logic is n't needed . what is needed is to look to the most authoritative sources : the labour party 's and parliament 's shadow cabinet lists . the are the record we have for what titles the leader granted . when jack straw held the post , he was \" acting shadow deputy prime minister \" . do they call her \" shadow deputy prime minister \" ? no , each calls her \" deputy leader \" . labour calls her \" deputy leader and shadow secretary of state for international development \" . parliament calls her \" deputy leader and shadow secretary of state for international development \" . her biography there lists \" deputy leader of the opposition - ; shadow secretary of state for international development - \" as her only current roles . : finally , as that last link shows , she is deputy leader of the opposition . inclusion of the title at her parliamentary bio is n't just an accident . i asked the house of commons information office to double check her titles and explain what was meant by \" deputy leader \" . the informed me that she is \" deputy leader of the opposition \" . : the authoritative sources have been consulted , and one of them even questioned directly , and the unambiguous answer from those sources is that she is deputy leader of the opposition and shadow secretary of state for development , not shadow deputy prime minister . - : why not [ external link : ask her about it ] ? and , in the meantime , put something like \" her personal website describes her as shadow dpm , however neither the labour party site nor the parliament site recognise this title . \" ? : as to the first point , i have already sent a request to through that very site and to ed miliband as a press inquiry . on the second point , i would have no objection to a note after \" deputy leader of the opposition \" saying that she claims the title \" shadow deputy prime minister \" , but the reverse would be unacceptable . with the authoritative sources using the one title and not the other , it is clear which should be in the infobox and which should be in the note . - : sounds good to me . what does our ip friend say to that ? well done for writing in to them . firstly , i am sure that r rius is lying . secondly , her website , the guardian , the bbc , the lse , several labour party websites , labour mps , ed mil band in many different sources have confirmed her as shadow deputy prime minister . they are not allowed to give her a title which is not hers , for example that is like william hague giving himself the official title deputy leader of the conservative party ! it 's non sen tical . she could not use a title which is not hers , the fact her party have used it shows she is the shadow deputy prime minister . i have consensus , i have support and i also have a ton of information which is accessible to all ! now , can you please allow me to continue editing instead of making yourself look even more foolish than you already do ! you can not block me since you are in in fact the one guilty of misconduct such as blanking my page , deleting information that backs up my point , being aggressive and attempting to block me without the power - in order words vandalism . now , you are vandalizing harriet harman 's page which has been already established as shadow deputy prime minister ! get a grip . sa di q khan shadows constitutional affairs , he is not the shadow deputy prime minister , his role is because traditionally under the labour government the lord chancellor has always been responsible for matters involving the constitution . nick clegg wants that power , so he took charge , normally it is the ministry of justice 's power ! if you were n't such a vandal , and knew something about politics maybe i would n't have to teach you a few home truths about westminster politics . : firstly - r ru is is not lying , he might be in good faith mistaken but accusations such as lying are considered personal attacks here and continuation of such comments may well get your editing privileges restricted - see [ wiki link : wp : npa ] . please keep it polite , thanks . secondly , it clearly is disputable , so get a [ wiki link : wp : o ] or start a [ wiki link : wp : rfc ] . its also a minor issue unworthy of all this dispute , so reel it in a bit please . : to - i apologize but i personally do not believe he is being honest . he is vandalizing my talk page in order to conceal information that was given to me and he denied it though i have evidence , now he claims that he spoke to the commons information office . he also has been posting threats on my page , which is not true . i have got a stack of sources from labour , lse , guardian and others which say harriet harman is shadow deputy prime minister , not deputy leader of the opposition . i think we should reach an agreement but i am not going to put up with bullying . also , why has n't r rius got a warning from you about edit warring , surely he should too - if not he should be blocked ! : outrageous . show me one edit at your talk page where i have removed anything . i 've already challenged you on that falsehood , and that you persist in it makes it very hard to believe you are n't just lying to cast aspersions on me . i was willing to believe you just do n't know what you are talking about , but that is becoming untenable . : you are now accusing me of \" posting threats \" and \" bullying \" you , but all i did was warn you , twice i think , that if you persist in edit warring you 'll be blocked . those were warnings ( indeed , one used the edit - warring user warning template ) , not threats . : as for who gets warned , i have been trying to discuss this with you on this talk page and even on yours for weeks . you 've had to be dragged kicking and screaming into a discussion , and even after joining have persisted in edit warring despite there being no reasonable claim that you have obtained consensus on the talk page . : and yes , i exchanged emails with the house of commons information office , and they confirmed that she is the \" deputy leader of the opposition \" . i 'm happy to prove it , as well as the fact that i have already sent e - mails to miliband 's and harman 's offices , but i do n't know how . - : whereas he has been reverting you - you have been reverted by multiple editors . also in the last hours - he appears to have [ external link : a single revert ] and you have [ external link : at least three ] . i will post a [ wiki link : wp : rfc ] if you want to discuss and attract new attention . ? post a [ wiki link : wp : rfc ] but i will not accept bias . other editors agree with the stance taken on harriet harman and have also been reverting the ludicrous changes made by others . i have got a load of sources , and i will show them but i hope we could come to an unbiased solution to the issue , rather than resorting to threats . surely , he should be blocked for vandalism and personal abuse . : i am not seeing anything to warrant blocking of anyone . lets just try and find a solution ot the content dispute . what question shall i ask for the rfc ? rfc : shadow deputy prime minister are there reliable sources to describe har men as the shadow deputy prime minister ? see -

oliver - proves - s - big - cheese . html ] preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by * rfc stalker here : otrs question to her office will resolve the matter conclusively - suggest this be done in the meantime , lets go with what her official bio ( ie deputy leader of the op po shadow for int ) says unless there is any reliable source verifiable ( ie not or or synth ) that contradicts it - which doesnt seem to be the case . all \" contradictions \" are incidental , ie they use different terminology without explaining why , which can not be used as evidence of an intent to contradict unless other sources say so ( ie can not do or synth ) on it . it seems to me that the moniker of \" shadow deputy pm \" in rs is used informally to describe her de facto role in the op po to a coalition g vt , but it is also clear that the nature of a coalition govt has created complexities the media has not updated their language for . we seek facts from sources , not transcribe them ( ie not transcription monkeys ) , so we have to look at this background . : surely , with the amount of sources clearly stating that [ wiki link : harriet harman ] is the shadow deputy prime minister ( including her own letter to [ wiki link : andrew mitchell ] and her own website ) , would n't it be fair on the basis of clear sources an evidence to call harriet harman \" shadow deputy prime minister \" . i have looked for other sources and i have found very little - only one in fact - which calls harriet harman \" deputy leader of the opposition . that source was in fact an edit made by on the official opposition shadow cabinet page on wikipedia . : first , to address ce re jota : i have already sent an email to harman 's office and ed miliband 's office but have not yet received replies . i agree with your characterisation of what is going on in ip 's sources , with the addition that harman seems to call herself \" shadow deputy prime minister \" and some of the other sources may well , in fact some seem to be , merely drawing from that . : to ip : the number of sources is irrelevant . despite what you have said in edit summaries , no one is suggesting that harman is lying or filling her page with \" nonsense \" . if she calls herself that to provide a simple description of part of her duties , there is really nothing wrong with that . but that is different from her having been officially granted the title by ed miliband . so the question becomes , how do we know what titles ed miliband has granted her ? the best evidence available is the shadow cabinet list . miliband posted it on the labour website and gave a copy to the house of commons information office . the version on the labour website calls her \" deputy leader and shadow secretary of state for international development \" , the version on the parliament website says exactly the same thing . harman 's bio on the parliament website says \" deputy leader of the opposition - ; shadow secretary of state for international development - \" . because the parliament shadow cabinet list only says \" deputy leader \" , i sent them an e - mail asking about it , and i received the following response : . thank you for pointing this out , i have taken the matter up with the house of lords information office and hope that this will be resolved shortly . : . because harriet harman is listed directly beneath ed milli band , whose full title as leader of her majesty 's official opposition is given , we would hope that the fact that she is deputy leader of her majesty ' official opposition would be clear without having to repeat the full title . to my knowledge this is the first time it has been queried but i will look into whether it is a common misunderstanding and of course amend the page if necessary . : i hope this is helpful . : kind regards : lyn ne pre ece : i would have left out the first paragraph , which is about an unrelated issue dealing with lords wh ips , but i figured ip would make more false accusations against me if i did . i would also like to address a point ip has made about custom . he suggests that it is always \" shadow deputy prime minister \" . that is in fact not true . no leader of the opposition named any such thing when michael he sel tine and john prescott were deputy prime minister . when he sel tine was deputy pm , the office held no responsibilities , so his labour counterpart shadowed his regular portfolio . when prescott was deputy pm , successive leaders of the opposition appointed his counterparts as either \" shadow secretary of state for the office of the deputy prime minister \" or shadow secretary for the substantive portfolio , e . g . , \" shadow secretary of state for the environment , transport and the regions \" . i have not finished looking at the kin nock years , but at least from , there was no shadow deputy prime minister . : so we can go back about thirty years , and the only person who carried anything like the title was jack straw , who as shadow justice secretary was responsible for clegg 's portfolio of political and constitutional reform and therefore called \" acting shadow deputy prime minister \" on the official shadow cabinet lists produced by harriet harman as leader of the opposition . to me it is clear , as deputy labour leader , she wanted the post of \" shadow deputy prime minister \" , which is why she called straw \" acting \" sd pm . in any event , when the new official shadow cabinet list came out in , miliband did not retain the title . responsibility for shadowing clegg was divided : harman shadows him on cross - government issues , and sa di q khan ( the shadow justice secretary ) and his team shadow him on political and constitutional reform . thus , it makes sense for miliband not to have named a shadow deputy pm since the duties were divided . it also makes sense for harman , who was upset she did n't get \" deputy prime minister \" after her election as deputy leader , to want to describe her responsibilities that way . ultimately , though , what matters is not what harman calls herself , whatever her motives , nor how the media choose to sum up her responsibilities . : what matters is that we reflect her actual official titles . we have two authoritative sources , ones that come from the man responsible for handing out official titles for the opposition , and neither says she is shadow deputy prime minister . other sources , no matter how numerous , do not trump the best evidence of what her true titles are . - : anyone can send a letter to any organisation . i have sent letters to buckingham palace ! you should produce the letter in full with your real name ! : thats not helpful or informative - as the user is long term and trusted we assume good faith and there is no need at all to post anything with anyones real name on . i can see no argument that hh is not deputy pm , am i missing something ? : no one is saying she is deputy pm ; she ca n't be because labour is n't in government . the argument that she is n't shadow deputy pm has been made several times : the infoboxes only record titles granted by appointment or election . it is clear that harman has called herself shadow deputy pm and that other sources have im it ated her . on the other hand , that does n't mean she was ever officially granted the title by the one human being on earth with the right to grant it : ed miliband . how would we know what titles he has or has n't granted ? the obvious answer is to look to the shadow cabinet list he drafted last year . the list is available at [ external link : labour 's website ] and [ external link : parliament 's website ] . both show her as \" deputy leader and shadow secretary of state for international development \" , not \" shadow deputy prime minister \" . it has also already been explained above why she and the media would call her shadow deputy prime minister even if she does n't officially hold the title basically , it is a simpler way of describing her position that the title she actually holds ( deputy leader of the opposition ) . at wikipedia we must follow what reliable sources tell us . reliable sources certainly call her \" shadow deputy pm \" . no one is disputing that . what is in dispute is whether that is an official title in her majesty 's opposition . reliable , indeed authoritative , sources show she was not given that title , so it should not be treated otherwise and certainly should not be in the infobox . - : i think you are missing the point . very few sources - next to none - say she is \" deputy leader of the opposition \" but sixteen reliable sources have named her as \" shadow deputy prime minister \" , but even in the labour party website . ed miliband has given her that position otherwise she would not be allowed to use it , it is very clear . you can not use a title unless appointed by your leader , in the event of another queen 's speech she will be standing next to nick clegg not andrew mitchell . i think reliable sources , is enough to actually conclude she is shadow deputy prime minister . \" deputy leader \" is not sufficient to give her deputy leader of the opposition . i will change it , until more sources are found which rebuke my point instead of speculation from . sixteen sources ! preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : no , i 'm not missing the point . it does n't matter how many sources use \" deputy leader of the opposition \" ; the sources that do use it are im pe cc ably reliable . that is all that matters as far as that goes . i do n't actually want either one in the infobox , but including deputy leader of the opposition seemed a reasonable compromise . you keep saying that she ca n't use the title \" shadow deputy prime minister \" if she did n't get it from the leader , but that just is n't so . it has been explained to you over and over why she might call herself that , and even why it is understandable that she would , even though she clearly has n't been granted the title . you also say the labour site uses that title for her . that 's not true . her personal space at the site and articles clearly drafted by her office use it . not a single one of your sources uses the title in a way that connects it to ed miliband . who she stands next to is irrelevant . the deputy leader of the opposition would be as likely to stand next to the deputy pm as anyone else . you say that \" deputy leader \" is not sufficient to \" give her \" deputy leader of the opposition . that is untenable . i have produced an email from the house of commons information office where they explicitly told me that is exactly what is meant by it and that they do n't repeat \" of the opposition \" because it is understood . i have also produced her comm mons biography which lists her as holding the role of \" deputy leader of the opposition ( - ) \" , and notably not \" shadow deputy prime minister \" . your conclusion that she must have been officially given the title of \" shadow deputy prime minister \" if she uses it is speculation at best . my conclusion that if the shadow cabinet lists and her commons bio call do not call her that , then she is n't , is not . in addition , my conclusion that she has the title of \" deputy leader of the opposition \" because the house of commons information office , which receives its information directly from the opposition , says so is also not speculation . finally , you have not obtained consensus for your changes , so stop edit warring . if the discussion ends with a result favourable to your position , then it will be time for your edit , not before . your persistence in edit warring even as a discussion , let alone an rfc , is in progress is wholly unacceptable and completely out of step with the way this project works . - : sorry , i obviously missed out ' shadow ' . : to be clear , i was n't trying to be snarky . my experience , both from join participating in discussions that go to rfc and from joining because of an rfc , tells me not to assume a mistake like that is an accident . - : i see the argument now . it seems to about whether we can use a title used in many sources but which does not seem to have been officially bestowed by the shadow pm . : precisely . i think ip 's one - sided framing of the discussion obscured the actual point of contention . - : i think the solution to this problem is quite simple . there is no written british constitution and most things in british government are purely a matter of tradition . there probably is no ' official ' answer to the exact title of many politicians . this is surely a case for a classic british compromise . let us state the facts as they are in the sources and state that hh is described in some sources as sd pm but she does not appear on certain other lists as having that title . : doing this leaves some very minor issues . should we use d sp m in the info box and then state that some sources do not support this , or do we not use that term in the info box and state later on that some sources do use that term , or do we complicate the info box by trying to give the complete picture there . maybe an asterisk would do the trick . : i think makes a good point . obviously , r rius has lost not only the point but the plot ! you can not use a title in the shadow cabinet unless you have permission from your leader , it is af act . now you are tal kign absolute nonsense . i think that the guardian , the labour party , the lse and harriet harman - are more reliable sources . i contacted the house of commons too , and they seem to also accept what i am saying . some boi graphies have no pt even put down ed balls as shadow chancellor ! she is the sd pm , and nothing you can say will change the reliability of sixteen sources compared to your incorrect word . : the most encyclopedic solution is simply to explain both sides of the situation . something like : \" harman , supported by a , b , and c , considers herself to be the sd pm , but e and f contend that she does not have that role because xyz . \" : that may be an optimal solution . : i think the optimal solution would be to include neither in the infobox and describe the situation in the prose . - : that is not what is going on . harman can not use a title which is not hers , for eg , she never used the title deputy prime minister even though she was , effectively , at one point ! you can not consider yourself to be something , you either are or you are not . that is the fact of the matter , all these sources - which actually include very respected sources , claim she is the shadow deputy prime minister . why do n't you leave it at that ? : where do you get the idea that she ca n't summarise her role as \" shadow deputy prime minister \" even if she does n't carry that title ? you are making an assumption , an unwarranted one at that , and wikipedia ca n't make content decisions based on your personal assumptions . - : ip : you may want to read [ wiki link : wp : truth ] . the goal in wp is not to establish what is true or not , but rather to summarize in an encyclopedic way what the sources say about a given topic . i gather from the discussion above that some sources say she does have that role , and other sources say she does not have the role . as editors , we do n't need to determine which side is correct . we just have to represent them both . : can you count ! over sources , not including harriet harman herself , have called b her shadow deputy prime minister whereas you have made an assumption . i think wikipedia , is shooting itself in the foot having your suggestion . i think it should remain shadow deputy prime minister , but say that she is also in effect the deputy leader of the opposition ! : there is no assumption . it is a fact that the labour party 's announced list of shadow responsibilities calls her \" deputy leader \" and in delivering their list to the house of commons information office , they made it know she is \" deputy leader of the opposition \" . that is confirmed by the e - mail i reproduced above and by the presence of that title on the biography of harman produced by the h cio . whether you have , , or , sources calling her by some other style does n't make them any more authoritative . it is ed miliband , not harriet harman or the news media , who decides what to call shadow cabinet roles . we know what he has called the roles because he assembled a list and posted it at labour 's site and distributed it to the h cio . you are most certainly making an assumption . you assume that if harman or the media use a title , it must have come from the leader , but that assumption has no basis . she can summarise her responsibilities as \" shadow deputy prime minister \" without technically having that as an official title . perhaps you could take a break from edit warring to grace us with a response to the proposal that we include neither title in the infobox and explain the situation in the prose . - before anyone on either side thum ps the table again they need to produce some evidence that there is an official rule about titles of british politicians . otherwise , this is just a matter of opinion and the balancing of sources against one another and there should be a compromise reflecting that fact . : i 'm not sure what you are asking for . the leader of the day of the opposition names the shadow cabinet and assigns portfolios and shadow titles to members of their party . in doing so , they are not constrained by the particular titles used by the government . when david cameron became leader of the opposition , john prescott was deputy leader of the labour party and deputy prime minister . at the time , prescott no longer had a substantive portfolio . as a result , cameron did n't name anyone to shadow him . he did give william hague the title \" senior member of the shadow cabinet \" . back when prescott had a substantive department handling environment , transport and the regions within the \" office of the deputy prime minister \" , conservative leaders appointed people to shadow him as \" shadow secretary of state for environment , transport and the regions \" or \" shadow secretary of state for the office of deputy prime minister \" . this goes beyond shadowing deputy pms . when lord man del son 's business department swallowed universities and skills , cameron kept shadow secretaries for both departments . when michael foot was the labour leader , there was a secretary of state for health and social services , but at one point he named separate shadow health and shadow social services secretaries . those are just the ones that occur to me off the top of my head . sometimes con figuring or naming portfolios is a signal for what the party leader intends to do if elected . the media has no role other than reporting what it has learned ( usually through press release ) from . again , i 'm not sure exactly what you are asking for , but if you are looking for sources , it is easy enough to google \" named shadow cabinet \" or some of the particular things i 've mentioned to see they are true . - : you say , ' the leader of the day of the opposition names the shadow cabinet and assigns portfolios and shadow titles to members of their party ' . this is undoubtedly true , but where does it say that the names assigned as above are the ' official ' or ' only ' or ' constitutionally correct ' names . this may seem eminently reasonable or even obvious to you but it seems that this is not so to some other people . most of british politics is governed by tradition and custom . most of the names used for government positions are informal or customary . there simply are no hard and fast rules or ab sol u tes in british politics and to continue to argue as thought there were is pointless . : you must either produce an official document which states that your preferred title is the only one possible or there must be compromise . : it is simple logic . if leader of the opposition hands out and names portfolios ; where in the process does someone else acquire the right to rename the portfolio ? something is \" official \" because it comes from the source with the right to produce it . in the case of shadow portfolios , that entity is the leader of the opposition and him alone . you are asking , no , demanding that i do the impossible . the shadow cabinet is a creature of custom , not law . even the ip editor implicitly recognises the obvious : that the leader is the source . his argument is that miliband must have given her the title because she uses it . if you do n't believe me , go back and read what he has written . in any event , i do everything in my power to produce a source such as you request if you produce one suggesting that anyone else has any say whatsoever in the naming of opposition portfolios . - : that is a perfectly reasonable opinion , that the leader of the opposition be sto ws titles on members of the shadow cabinet . on the other hand , since the titles are customary and not defined in any written constitution , it could equally well be argued that custom is defined by practice and the media actually decide the titles . that point can never be definitively resolved so we must compromise . : as for your other option , compromise , i have proposed one that is eminently reasonable : remove the position from the infobox altogether and present the information we have in the prose . unfortunately , no one has bothered to respond to it . - : that might be acceptable to the other side . would you accept having the title in the infobox but with an asterisk or link to the prose description you suggest\n",

      "a ] version that 's closer to an \" alpha \" than \" beta \" status ! surely , you meant it the other way around ? ) : oops , so i do ! : regarding the map , i 'm sure rarelibra will do the requested corrections eventually ; after all , even though all this is taking a lot longer than anticipated , we are in no particular hurry . : cf [ wiki link : commons : user talk : rarelibra image : adygea districts . png here ] ( re [ external link : this ] , if not already seen ) . : i also have a few comments regarding the changes you 've made ( thanks for proofreading , by the way my prose , unfortunately , is not at its best when i 'm trying to ju ggle a hundred things at once ) : . list of administrative , territorial , and municipal units . you are correct , it it my intent to rename the article once it 's ready . i do have my reservations regarding the term \" subdivisions \" , however . i generally am trying to avoid this term unless there is absolutely no other option ( [ wiki link : subdivisions of russia ] being a good example ) . the reason is that so far i 've seen way too many complaints about it . as you , of course , know , the principal meaning of the term , especially in the united states , is a \" lot of land \" , or \" land parcel \" , something , say , a town home would be built on . it is not really used often when referring to administrative ( or other kinds of ) units a country is divided into . while in all the arguments neither side was particularly convincing , i am trying to avoid the term ( or at least not to rely on it too much ) just in case . do you think the title \" administrative , territorial , and municipal divisions of adygea \" would be unacceptable ( that is , besides its being quite long ) ? : i suppose ( ) i 'm not sure where the distinction between \" administrative \" and \" territorial \" divisions lies , at least in this article ; and ( ) i consider a \" municipal division \" to be a type of \" administrative division \" whether accurately or inaccurately , i do n't know so i 'm wondering whether the article 's title need be any more descriptive than \" administrative divisions of adygea \" . ? : the definitions of \" administrative \" and \" territorial \" units come from the laws , and vary from one federal subject to another . quite often , as it is the case with adygea , there is no strict line , and everything is bundled under one \" administrative - territorial \" umbrella , so while in the end we still have a list of \" administrative and territorial units \" , it 's impossible to say which is which without original research . the municipal divisions are a different story . if administrative and territorial units represent the framework within which the bodies of state power operate ( think police , welfare , etc . ) , then the municipal units ( which are formed on the territories of administrative - territorial units ) are the framework for local self - government ( think water supply , trash removal , etc . ) . these two concepts are regulated by different legislative documents , but since they are very closely related , it makes sense to put them into one list . with that in mind , the title of the article should definitely be changed ( the original list did not even mention the municipal units , hence its name of \" administrative divisions of . \" ) . does this help any ? ; : . in the s . a decision was made to mix russians with the native adyghe population . this sentence is now followed by \" first , on [ wiki link : january ] [ wiki link : ] , north caucasus k ra i was split . \" . the fact that north caucasus k ra i was split in does not really have anything to do with the decision to mix russians with ady gh es , yet the way one sentence flows into another implies such a connection . further down , adyghe autonomous oblast is mentioned to become \" a subdivision of . az ov - black sea k ra i \" , but , again , strictly speaking it was not a subdivision . adyghe ao was considered to be a separate entity , yet in some aspects it was sub or din ated to az ov - black sea k ra i ( and later k ras no dar k ra i ) . the situation , while not identical , is very similar to , say , modern [ wiki link : ust - or da bur yat autonomous ok rug ] being a part of ir kut sk oblast , yet still being a separate federal subject of russia . i do n't want to restore my original wording , because i see that it indeed reads a bit awkwardly , but perhaps you could re - phrase this passage once more ? : i 'll take another ( now fresh ) look ; as regards the paragraph 's opening , i guess it read to me as if the re organizations were a consequence of the decision to mix the populations . glad this possibility has been detected ! : . districts sections new formatting . looks good , although i bet , being a fan of \" human - readable prose \" , will call it too list y ) also , is n't the sentence about all population numbers being per the census redundant ? all population numbers are referenced below anyway . : re being too list y , you could point ( ) to its opening words at present ! being \" this is a . \" ; and ( ) to the current encyclopedia version being a featured . ( chuckle ) . re the \" all populations per the russian census \" sentence , i think i was moved to add it as otherwise it 's only implicit , i . e . only seen if one or other of the references is accessed . i may be missing something obvious , though , that hopefully i 'll spot when i 'm reading through the article again . : good point ! as long as this stays an fl and not an fa , i guess \" being too list y \" should not be a concern . ; : . one question i was meaning to ask you for quite a while now , but kept forgetting , is about \" the village ( sel o , aul , etc . ) of foo \" construct . i 've seen this alternatively worded as \" village ( sel o , aul . ) foo \" and \" foo village ( sel o , aul ) \" in some sources , but i could never find out whether such constructs were valid english . \" village foo \" seems to be a cal que from russian ( ) , and the other one just does n't sound right , at least to my ear . would you , by any chance , know for sure if they are ok to use ? : i 'd say i agree , certainly re the \" village foo \" construction ; and also say that \" the village of foo \" seems to be the correct prose form , if somewhat formal . [ testing : \" here we are in the city of philadelphia . \" ; \" here we are in philadelphia city [ city ? ] . \" ] . since , though , the article is primarily a list a \" pro sed - up \" list . ? . ! then \" foo ( village ) \" , \" foo ( sel o ) \" , etc would seem sensible . does any of this m using help . ? : sorry for being dense , but no ( after reading the above , i 'm still not sure which of the variants you consider acceptable . could you , please , clarify further ? ; : . as for the moscow oblast table above , i 'll wait for your reply when you have time . thanks again for everything ! ; : sorry not to 've replied more promptly ! yours , : ps re , i 'm not sure now whether you intend to use this template , but , if so , permission to \" be bold \" and amend the parameter names . ? shock - horror ( - chuckle ) , : first of all , if you are waiting on me to archive that section of your talk page , just go ahead and archive it , unless , of course , you have other reasons to keep it open . all in all , i am not yet quite sure myself where i want to go with that template and how to amend it further , but if meanwhile you 'd like to amend the parameter names , i do n't have any objections\n",

you will be blocked and your version reverted - securing the victory of your wiki - enemies . is that what you want ? just play nice and all will be nice . : play \" nice \" ? what does that mean ? does it means i have to accept disinformation and pov ? anyway rr project page says clearly that rr does not apply when there is a content dispute and or revert of vandalism is in question . the situation with josip run janin article is just that . : actually , it does refer to content disputes - and that 's what 's going on over there . it 's josif run janin article , not josip ( josip run janin 's a redirect ) . what disinformation ? \" playing nicely \" means following the rules - and nobody gets hurt . : let me quote you an excerpt from the project page : please also be aware that this page is not the place to bring disputes over content , or reports of abusive behavior we are n't referees , and have limited authority to deal with abusive editors . we have a dispute resolution procedure which we recommend you follow . if you bring such disputes here , we will usually advise you to take them elsewhere , such as mediation , requests for comment , or requests for arbitration . we really do mean this ; this is not the page to bring up accusations of bad faith , or pov pushing . : yes - the rule does not cover lodging appeals for that - what it is for however , is filing rr violation reports . the injunction you violated . : the rr is not for settling edit - war and content dispute . when one ( like me ) is cleaning up pov and vandalism this rule is not to be applied . as per explanation on the page . : you have misunderstood the rule . this is exactly what the policy is for . to prevent edit warring . there is no \" cleaning up pov \" , and i repeat , the argument was a content dispute and not vandalism . why do you think they invented the rule ?

report this \" gi or go orsini \" . he keeps removing content from [ wiki link : list of croatians ] and the very sentence i mentioned above from [ wiki link : marco polo ] and that has been characterized as vandalism before and not by me ( pax made it known to me ) . as i am currently blocked i think it would , obviously , be good that someone else does it . i am really tired of this guy . thank you . i do n't want to get involved in an edit war over marco polo . as for giovanni he has done many edits on croatian related articles . he should be blocked but he has a right to his opinion . look at ivan l up is for example . he says ivan l up is was italian origin while on the other hand he does n't accept a possible origin of marco polo as croatian . contradiction and heavy italian pov but again that ' t his view . i would ' t worry too much what 's on wiki . many other places show that marco polo did have a link with croatia , either by blood or by birth . everyone knows wiki is open to edits so no need to read things here as fact . just popular opinion . take care unblock your request to be unblocked has been granted for the following reason ( s ) : [ wiki link : wikipedia : autoblock autoblock ] lifted . request handled by : re : a bit of help please i 'll see what i can do . cheers . : try [ wiki link : wikipedia : administrator intervention against vandalism ] . however , the best thing is to simply as any administrator , if you feel like filing boring form ul ars is something you do n't really have time to do . : well yes , i checked that page but it says i need to warn him first . i did but he erased it so i am kinda worried that if i do report it will be dismissed because i failed to warn him prior . i also thought about reporting him to some admin , the thing is i do n't know any admins . there is mir len but she deals more with tolkien related stuff . : !

neither language has a majority or even a significant minority in the cities , so i do n't understand why they need to be there . just because croatia was ruled by the austrian - hungarian empire , does not mean we still need to have traces of their names for our cities . there are hundreds of thousands of croatians that live in germany , i do n't see croatian names listed on german pages . : i do not \" want \" them . they are simply there and should thus be shown as well . it 's part of croatian history so i do n't see why would that bother you . : ok i removed these name versions . i did left and explanation in osi jek article because osi jek once had rather large german minority ( in fact it was a majority ) and the hungarians still call it by their version . as for dj ak ovo you are right , i do n't see a reason because it never had any significant hungarian minority so i removed it com pe le tely . as for beli man as ti r i left it due to still large presence of hungarian minority and due to rather cont ro versi ve history about of the name . : almost no croatian city articles have cyrillic ( serbian ) versions of their names - not even kn in would have if i did n't add . ) : that is because cyrillic script is not legal in croatia and also due to the fact that most ( if not all ) cities are spelled same in serbian as in croatian . : i think you accidentally used wrong wording . \" not legal \" means \" illegal \" . if you are referring to of fic i alism ; where is greek , latin , hungarian or whatever official ? and just like you said - there are exceptions . : cyrillic is simply not officially regulated for use and is thus \" not legal \" , that is what i meant . : well , neither is latin , greek , hungarian or italian ( although the latter is indeed ' somewhere ) . by the way , come to dal j , for instance ; there is a cyrillic inscription \" welcome fo dal j \" . blocked again you have been blocked for renewed edit - warring , including skirting the rr with reverts in hours on [ wiki link : marco polo ] , and more revert - warring on other articles . : first of all i was n't edit - warring and i certainly am not involved in any edit - warring now . as for your claim of \" skirting \" the rr rule with reverts in hours that is just ridiculous and the difference is over hours ( almost h ) . that is not breaking of any existing rules on wikipedia and i have certainly deserved better . furthermore you refused to block a certain user i reported who clearly broke the rr and has been involved in the edit - warring on the [ wiki link : josip run janin ] article for a very long time and has recently on the very page ( rr project page ) insulted me personally ( challenging my understanding of english ? ! ) . : gaming the system ( with the extra edits just past h ) would be seen as a rr vio : i was n't \" gaming \" anything , if you look carefully at my edits they are simple reverts of the removed content by various members . they keep removing the content without any explanation and despite the fact it is substantiated with evidence . : sorry , but you 've clearly been edit - warring , and have shown little understanding of [ wiki link : wp : v ] , which says that \" any edit lacking a source may be removed \" . and when you add a source , remember to respect [ wiki link : wp : rs ] . : if i was edit - warring so was esta vi sti who also recently broke the rr and you did nothing and continue to do nothing . as for marco polo article i did n't broke any rule and i have been merely reverting and bringing back the removed parts of the article ( which is still being removed ) which is generally considered vandalism , yet i get blocked . appeal [ wiki link : list of croatians ] hi ! in response to your message , i have contacted user : gi or gio orsini and left them . please read it as well ( sorry , i do n't feel like repeating spamming ) , since i believe you are not without fault in this what seems like an [ wiki link : wikipedia : edit war ] . i encourage both of you to resolve this matter by means of [ wiki link : wp : dr dispute resolution ] on the [ wiki link : talk : list of croatians article 's talk page ] . thank you\n",

      "just curious to know how muslim janjuas can claim to be arjuna 's and krishna 's de sen dants . spiritually , that ancestry ended as soon janjuas converted to islam . islam calls anything pre - islamic jah ali ya . hindus would regard converted rajputs with equal con descension as mal ech has and not consider them rajput kshatriya anymore . : firstly , let me correct you , that janjua allege arjun descent , not krishna descent . hs - arjuna was a disciple of krishna as well as his cousin . both shared a common grandfather . arjuna 's mother was krishna 's aunt and krishna was grand - uncle of jan ma je ya , the claimed progenitor of janjua clan . so you are not without some of krishna 's blood if you are de sen dants of arjuna . : not quite . krishna although related , is claimed as arjun is . i see your point , i am trying to explain to you that we specifically dont claim his ancestry at all . : secondly , many hindus who are extremist would consider your opinion , but it is proven that in real world scenarios many also do not source self and sovereignty : individual and community in south asian islam since by ay esha jalal , routledge , p . : lineal genetic descent is a scientifically phenomenon , not simply just a spiritual one , especially when one considers that many of todays hindus were at one time non hindus and therefore no longer spiritual heirs to even the original dravidians or indeed the much touted ( and poorly debated ) aryans . : faith conversion progression , does not alter societal practices of a dominant ruling tribe simply by the change of worship methods of a de ity the discovery of india by jawaharlal nehru , oxford uni . press , p . especially in a region as culturally and religiously diverse as hind . : ironically despite you allegation that they are no longer kshatriya ( which muslim janjuas are certainly not ) chin taman vin ay ak v ai dya ( author of many books \" mahabharata : a critism \" , \" downfall of hindu india \" , \" history of medieval hindu india \" to \" the riddle of the ramayana \" and \" history of sanskrit literature \" amongst others , has referred to the converted janjuas as the most valiant kshatriya of punjab ! history of mediaeval hindu india by chin taman vin ay ak v ai dya , cosmo pub l . , p . hs - this is where you erring , imho . kshatriya status , and cor re sp on dingly rajput status , was lost as soon as one gave up the faith of aryan vedic ancestors . the spiritual tradition that gave greatness to arjuna ( enough for you to claim descent from him despite being a muslim ) is categorical about this aspect . it does not recognize \" lineal genetic descent \" as you claim . the dharmic tradition based on laws of manu and maha b har ta , which arjuna , being a kshatriya , would have defended by all means , is clear that there is no \" lineal genetic descent \" and kshatriya status is not v ou ch saf ed by birth and can be lost through violation of spiritual tradition . conversion to islam would be one such violation . you are encouraged to read more about laws of manu and other sources of vedic traditions . you are relying on colonial accounts about \" martial races \" theory which has now been dismissed even by pakistani army . indian army got rid of this racist nonsense as soon the british left . pakistani army realized the folly of this myth after the humiliating defeat . read more here : [ externa link : http : www . def ence journal . com nov pak - army . htm ] : thats a hindu belief regarding kshatriya hood , not ancestral links . were this the case , that your deed 's change ancestry , then karna would n't have been re vi led for absent lineage by [ wiki link : dra up adi ] et al . hs - i am glad to have run into a muslim who knows so much about maha b har ta - ) . it was a fault of p and avas to have downgraded him . according to maha b har ta , p and avas were not f aul tless . krishna and yu d his thra gave full respect to karna and always chi ded arjuna for insulting a great warrior like karna . karna 's situation was the adopted son of a royal ch ari o teer . the dice was totally loaded agi an st him . but he was still allowed to rule a kin god m . the town of kar nal is named after him in haryana . the characters of maha b har ta are not ideal and it pointed out repeatedly as part of the narrative . maha b har ta clarifies that it was written in the period of dw apara when the religious virtues were deteriorating and hence none of the characters were bl ame less . : likewise - d . its a great topic and i think the story itself shows immense wisdom to anyone who hears it ( which i believe is also a claimed miracle of that narrative ? ) karna did exemplify many ideals , even today he is spoken of with respect . i think the issue of his k sh at ri ya hood was an imposed dilemma to the ruling royal classes , who ofcourse saw k sh at ri ya hood as their \" right \" . he was exceptionally gifted as a warrior though , and both he and arjun were responsible for killing the other 's sons . if you have read maha b har ta with any great depth , you would know that karna was deemed a kshatriya by sage par sur ama just by observing how he sacrificed his own comfort for others . read more about karna and par sur ama episode . : i 've read that . the same sage had cursed him also because he hid his origins from him too . again , i think it was a dilemma of the age not accepting the dynamics of the feudal system , but i dont criticise their actions , they had wisdom , we simply attempt to try and have it . : but i do follow your point re a muslim no longer being a kshatriya if he has given up the beliefs of hinduism , i have stated this above . muslim rajputs generally dont refer to themselves as kshatriyas , but simply as rajputs , which although in india is ( as i have cited ) taken to mean the same , in punjab , they simply were not taken to mean the same . rajput simply denoting a ruling war like tribe . the very same point that even major todd made of the rajas than i tribes . muslim janjuas do not represent the values of arjuna and in my humble opinion should refrain from referring to them as their ancestors . : unfortunately for your humble opinions , they are his sons whether they were of abrahamic faith , african faith or a martian faith , a lineage does not end based on faith , how ridiculous . this is their heritage , not anyone elses therefore deserves a place in whatever their current faith would be . this is also supported by the view of neutrality on wikipedia . arjuna would have never aided the like of bab ar , gaz ni , k hal ji , gh ori , etc against fellow hindu aryan kings and declared it with pride the way this wikipedia does . converting under duress after a defeat to an invading army is hardly a sign of bravery . collaborating with invaders against fellow kin smen , which you are not even making an effort to conceal in the article , is not bravery either . : this article presents a neutral view . why should history be doctored to hide negatives and hide subjective truths ? is that what you refer to as \" bravery \" ? thats hypocrisy im afraid . the article does n't seek to hide truth like many other articles do . it seeks a balanced historic view . : you make the naive assumption that all people became muslim under duress ? many tribes converted out of sheer change of faith too according to jawaharlal neh ru the discovery of india by jawaharlal nehru , oxford uni . press , p and even as recently as the th century hindu rajput kings converted out of choice to islam rulers of india , lord lawrence and the reconstruction of india under the crown by sir charles ai tch eson , k . c . s . i . , m . a . , ll . d . , clarendon press , v p which is recorded by the colonial sources . please read [ wiki link : muslim rajputs ] for further info . : now , despite criticising the article , you obviously havent read it properly . let 's take a look at each mentioned conqueror you hold janjuas in contempt of allying with ; ( in chronological order ) * ghazni - sultan mahmud of ghazni ? maharaja jay ap ala is infact , ( according to prof . ram gop al mis ra indian resistance to early muslim invaders , up to a . d . : up to a . d . , ram g pal mis ra , , p ) stated to showed a \" spirit of aggression so sadly lacking in later rajput kings \" , his dynasty eventually losing their entire kingdoms . you are therefore incorrect here . * gh ori - sultan mu iz - ul - din muhammad of gh or ? the janjuas lost their kingdom of mathura fighting them , eventually returning to the salt range , and mounting a new campaign against them , halting all traffic between kabul and lahore , ra zing lahore to the ground in defiance and fighting him un relent ingly to the man chronicles of early janjuas dr hussain khan , i universe , , p . you are again incorrect here . * k hal ji - sultan j al alu din k hal ji ? this is strange because the sultan actually wrote of the janjua as \" his enemies \" leading a punitive expedition against them for their un rel en ting resistance . he recorded , \" how at another time i ma der the blood flow in janjua , that a boat might have gli ded in the hills of jud \" pakistan journal of history and culture \" national institute of historical and cultural research ( pakistan ) , , p now that hardly appears to be an alliance ? * babur - bad shah za heer - ud - din muhammad babur ? now this is interesting . considering the janjuas resistance to the delhi sultanate , it seemed only natural for them to ally with him to overthrow the lo dis ( not un fam i li arly the way rana prat ap used sher shah 's brother against hu may un ? ) . but the proof of this being political , is that they immediately re be lled against hu may un , even heading the construction of ro ht as fort under shah 's patronage , to stop hu may un returning . the life and times of hum y n by ish wari prasad , published by orient long mans , , p however , when he did return , he ex ac ted a strong revenge against the janjuas who st ou tly resisted him through battle a history of india under the two first sovereign s of the house of ta im ur , b ber and hum y un ' by william er skine , long man , p eventually understanding the ir re si stable power of the mughal was here to stay in hind , they eventually accepted their sovereignty as did the majority of hind and its ruling clans . : janjuas like any other pan j abi tribe ( such as the sikh maharaja amar singh of pati ala aiding ab d ali ? gaining the title of raja - e - raj ga an ? indian states somerset play ne , r . v . solomon , j . w . bond , arnold wright , p for political reasons ) fought for their kingdom 's interests . : of all the conquer ors you just mentioned , janjua rajputs only allied with one of them , and that to for political motivations . the rest of your named conquer ors were resisted consistently , even to the loss of our kingdoms . so i find your points very naive aswell ( as proven above ) incorrect . your values , culture and faith are totally anti thetical to that of prince arjuna and hence people are going to find it curious why you are still hanging on to his h allowed memory . : thats strange and i openly challenge this , how is it strange that a grandson of a brahmin rishi v yas [ wiki link : arjuna ] can become a celebrated kshatriya ( brahmins ofcourse do not fight , and [ wiki link : vy asa ] was the father of [ wiki link : p and u ] , father of [ wiki link : arjuna ] ) and there 's no strange curiousity in this ? : his descendants totally renounce their hindu faith for bu dd his m buddhist sites and shrines in india : history , art and architecture by d . c . ahir - buddhist shrines , , p , there is no curiousity that their are still arjun descent k ur us ? : they later disregard their ancestral practice of shiv ling am worship ( arjun famously did this to acquire many celestial weapon shin du myth s anna liber a dal la pic cola , , p ) as va ish an vi tes the history and culture of the indian people by ram esh chandra maj um dar , ach ut d att at r ya pus al ker , a . k . maj um dar , di lip kumar gh o se , vish van ath go vind di ghe , bharatiya vidya bha van , , p , yet there was no curiousity ? : they suddenly adopt a faith which they are comfortable with who ; like the modern orthodox christian greeks who hold on to the mighty achievements of their pagan helen ic ancestors , the italians of their mighty roman ancestors , the discovery of india by jawaharlal nehru , oxford uni . press , p , people would then suddenly find this curious ? i dont think so , i think considering how punjab is known as the \" melting pot of india \" indigenous peoples and ethnic minorities of pakistan by sha he en sardar ali , j av aid , , p it is obvious that the peoples there would develop a synthesis of races and cultures more diverse than any other region in the cont in ent the new encyclopaedia britannica , , p . : last but not least , you say arjun would never have fought against his own aryan folk ? are you even aware that the mahabharata nar rates how he sub ju gated the whole of northern india kshatriya kings ( \" aryan kin folk \" as you put it ) under his clan ? in fact the bh ag v ad gita is a record of his inner debate with sri krishna , about waging war on his own family , the ka ur avas , who stood against him . some texts refer to this as religiously motivated by ethics morality , others have stated this to have been a political racial war . again , each side has their own perspective . hs - arjuna fought to defend aryan faith . again , i must clarify the way the word \" arya \" was taught by british was wrong . it is not a racist but a cultural concept . the so - called aryans that arjuna fought had all fallen from aryan ideals . he fought to restore those values in pursuit of arya dharma . ka ur vas , their cousins , had taken to evil ways . imagine dis ro bing a royal woman in the court ! that is why he fought them . without alignment with vedic dharma , arjuna was a nobody . in bh ag vat gita it is made clear to him time and again that the war is not for his personal glory but in pursuit of dharma . : i agree re the values of arjun 's campaign being ethical . however , other sources also claim counter to this ( not me , im not getting into that debate lol ) . i was just making the point , that sometimes wars against your own people do happen for whatever reason , in response to your point that arjun wouldnt have fought his own aryan people . personally , i see the validity of his campaign and you put it pretty much fairly to my own opinion . about raja of pati ala being ab d ali collaborator . you make a fair point but you should know that no sikh ever in vo kes with pride the name of the rajas of pati ala . he is not regarded as a sikh hero . infact this incident is only used to taunt sikhs from pati ala . sikh hero is ranjit singh who val our ously subdued afghans and conquered kashmir and parts of afghanistan . : true , but that house has relations with some known rajput houses . i know its a contested debate whether pati ala was a sikh kingdom or a sid hu jat kingdom , personally their actions deeds showed best . but either way , i respect that as a king he may have took a decision which he thought best for his king ship kingdom , many houses , included me war did the same when they pe ti tioned the british foreign rulers for help against the marathas . politics usually overrides majority of the time . please do n't get me wrong . i am not here to insult or downgrade anyone but the irony of the narrative you have presented is too striking . : the article is a balanced cited history of a tribe . i stress , that we havent attempted to hide history , but project it in a neutral balanced way . what you may term as non brave , many may hail as brave . it is a point of view perspective i guess . but thats left to the readers to draw conclusion , rather than lead them to appear just positive negative through structured censorship . perhaps you are not aware that status of rajput and kshatriya was not by birth and was lost as soon as one lost that culture that gave meaning to those words . muslim janjuas can be considered rajputs only the most distorted meaning of the term . : ironically , the british who had a very sound knowledge of \" raj pu tism \" actually referred to the muslim janjuas as \" the only really pure rajputs in the plains of punjab . \" \" recruiting , drafting , and en listing ( military and society , ) \" peter kar sten , , usa , p as well as \" doubtless pure rajputs \" the imperial gazetteer of india by sir william wilson hunter , , tru b ner and co . , p the indian village community by baden henry baden - powell , adamant media corp . , p and \" well - known martial race of janjua rajput tribe of j hel um \" biographical encyclopedia of pakistan by biographical research institute , pakistan , pub l , p ( the home of only muslim janjua rajputs ) and also , \" the great janjua tribe have retained their pride of lineage and their r j put title , and can be ranked as m n s hu or first class r jp ts \" pan jab castes sir den zil ib bet son , delhi , p , p . your opinion is obviously not corroborated by these non janjua sources . although i must say that i am hear tened to learn that muslim janjuas have not forgotten their truly great forefathers and maybe there might be a ray of hope that they might come back to the faith of their heroic ancestors\n",

      "thank you . i still have some questions problems with some of your statements . : persecution is by its very definition a col lec tivist concept . : you are turning a historical question into a semantic question . and in the process you are distorting the issue in two ways . first , the definition of persecution is not at issue here . the issue is , what actually happened . you can not say \" there was persecution , and since persecution is by definition collective , therefore the acts were collective . \" you can not deduce what happened from the definition of a word . : that is not what i am doing at all . you seem to be suggesting that , unless every last member of a group per se cu tes every last member of another group , then the situation can not be considered persecution , which would mean that every incidence of persecution throughout history would not be persecution , and so persecution would not exist . so , i offer the definition of persecution to counter that because , you must admit , that assertion of yours narrows the definition of persecution to the point where it is rendered useless . i am not attempting to prove my argument from nothing but the term at hand , but attempting to prove that the term at hand applies to my argument . i am asserting that the concept of persecution applies to the situation if indeed it played out in the way i am ar gu eing that it did . you seem to be arguing that the term could never apply to any situation . or perhaps i am misunderstanding something here ? : you need historical evidence . i know of no historical evidence that non - christian jews persecuted christians as a group or collectively . : i will address the issue of evidence in a bit . : second , you turn the issue of \" collective \" on its head . my point was that not all jews or even non - christian jews persecuted christians , which is why you should not use \" the jews \" which suggests collective guilt of the jews . even if some jews were prejudiced against all christians regardless of their acts or individual differences , this does not mean that all jews or even most jews were , and it is therefore wrong to say \" the jews . \" : what extent of col lec tivity does the jews imply ? if it means every jewish person who has ever lived , obviously that is way , way too broad for our purposes here . that is not what i meant when i originally used the phrase . if two jews went to the store , you could say , \" the jews went to the store \" . there is a wide range of col lec tivity in that term , depending on the context , but the broadest sense is the one usually implied , so that is why i agreed with you that we should not use the phrase the jews after your first reply and apologized for using it at all . we should find a phrase that works . how about \" some of the non - christian jews of judea \" ? would that be okay ? it is about as specific as i can make it . : that said , i think the phrase , say , \" the european settlers persecuted the first nations people , \" is useful . it is implied by the word persecute itself that only some of the european settlers persecuted some of the first nations people , yet is was done because of differences between the groups , in part , by individuals who represented the europeans as a collective , such as leaders and authorities . it is not about establishing absolute col lec tives , just using terms of con vi eni ence for describing conflicts between groups of people in general terms . if you think that the word some is needed because the concept of persecution does not make the generality of the phrase explicit enough , i am fine with that . : what happened to romans who di so be yed the emperor ? they were treated less harshly : i am afraid i do not know what you mean . less harshly than whom ? : than non - romans who di so be yed the emperor . i think that was embodied in roman law . : in any event , this is irrelevant . you are making a vast generalization when we are talking about one specific issue . : well , you say that the romans are responsible for the persecution in this specific case , because the hands of the jewish authorities were forced , so i mentioned the fact that the romans ' hands were forced as well . that seems relevent to me . : jewish authorities were responsible for maintaining peace . those who did n't were killed by the romans . moreover , civil unrest always led to massive military action by the romans resulting in hundreds or thousands of people killed or enslaved . these are simple facts , and they explain why jewish authorities tried to maintain the peace . : i think you are blaming the victim . two of the three groups involved were victims , but one group was a victim of both of the other two . : i think you go too far in saying that judea had lost all hope of being free from the empire , though . : again , what is your evidence ? all of my research argues , strongly , that you are wrong . after , most jews had lost hope of being free from the empire . after virtually all jews lost all hope of being free from the empire . you have told me what you think , but you have n't given me any evidence that i am \" going too far \" and have not shared your research with me . : all of your research ? i have to admit that i am no expert on the subject , but the little i have read about it suggests the opposite of what you claim . i will see what i can find as far as evidence goes , and in the meantime would you mind sharing your research with me ? i would like to read both sides of the story myself . : persecution may refer to unwarranted arrest , imprisonment , beating , torture , or execution . it also may refer to the conf is cation or destruction of property , or incitement to hate christians : okay , how many documented cases are there of jews arresting , im prison ing , beating , torturing , or executing christians without warrant ? how many documented cases are their of confiscated or destroyed property or incitement to hatred ? what is your evidence ? : those s edi tious statements were a matter of christian belief . the romans did not like that belief because it threatened them , so they decided to persecute those who believed it , ( i . e . the jewish christians ) in order to eliminate threat . since the jewish authorities of judea used their authority to turn over the christians , they played a part in that persecution . : i am not sure what you mean by \" christian belief . \" christian belief as opposed to ( or differentiated from ) what ? : the jewish christians believed that christ is the lord . the non - christians did not . this belief is the source of the charges of sedition . it is also part of the christian belief system . i would say that it is the definitive belief of christianity , more - or - less . : i am certainly not justifying any act by the romans . i am making no claims about right or wrong . i am saying that if jews ever informed the romans of what christians were saying ( a far cry from unwarranted arrest , beating , execution of which there is no evidence ) it was not \" because \" the individuals in question were christian , but because they were com mi ting s edi tious acts that were illegal under roman rule . that 's all . : their illegal act of sedition was believing in and esp ousing one of the central tenants of christianity . would they be christians if they did not commit that crime ? : i will take a look around for some non biblical sources for my side of things . i know that i saw something somewhere on this talk page . also , i will see if i can find the book in which i first read the thing about the political vs . spiritual kingdom of god . i have final exams all next week so i might not get around to it until those are over . would you mind if the npov tag was removed ? everything is bound tight to the new testament in that section , and the fact that the early christians were jews is outlined . i have not read it in a while , so i will check to see if there any other problems with it we have covered here so far . i have to thank you for such an engaging discussion\n",

( talk ) ah , yes , but we probably need a quotation from another view that conflicts it . would anyone be able to find one ? her u nar some comments regarding france 's utter defeat in the napoleonic wars should be part of the article , nonetheless . the fact that france slipped from being the top european power to a secondary level , clearly below britain 's and soon also below germany 's and even austria 's , is hardly contentious . it must be remembered that the revolutionary wars and the napoleonic wars came hard on the heels of what appeared to europe 's intellectuals as britain 's final , un avoiding loss of great power status , following the independence of the u . s . ( just six years before the assault on the bas tille ) actually france was the dominate continental power until the franco - prussian war and remains a great power to this day . i must respectfully disagree with this latest assertion , since france was smaller in size and less influential than both austria and russia before the prussian war . even if one were to concede that it was the main \" continental \" power , that would imply a loss of status - before the napoleonic wars , it was the main european power , including britain , and had beaten combined enemy armies time and time again . as for keeping great power status to this day , i 'm sure that should come as great surprise to the french , humiliated by nazi occupation and re sol u tely defeated both in vietnam and algeria . now , it 's true they can veto stuff in the un - just like the ( then ) underdeveloped island of taiwan did until , for whatever that 's worth . aussi esta who cares about your stupid pov ? you are telling nonsense . nazi humiliation etc , p ff . were n't the us humiliated in vietnam , in cuba and now in iraq ? so they are n't great anymore then right ? did n't the soviet retreated from afghanistan ? what about them ? the german were defeated and occupied in and what about them ? what about the old good british ? they were wiped by the germans in the campaigns of ( norway ) then ( france ) and dun kirk , a defeat transformed into a great victory , what a joke ! actually in indochina and algeria the french had times less casualties than their opponents , is this a defeat ? a defeat is supposed to happen when one is loosing a war not when he is winning it . these two de colonization wars were wasted by politics . the very same happened in the overlooked suez crisis of . the british surrendered there . they left their french and israeli \" allies \" without warning . ever heard about the mad ag as ac ar war of independence ? no ? why ? because france smashed the rebellion in a such violent way there ashamed of . no one knows what happened in madagascar in so it is not in history books . moreover france is still a great power with remaining overseas territories and a strong nuclear force ( the third one in terms of warheads after russia and usa ) your beloved austrian and german does n't have . so watch your tongue . quoting a non neutral pov is just the same as giving your own opinion . who do you think you can fool with your fran cop ho bic tricks ? ah , the legendary french manners . brushing insults and rants aside , my point remains unchallenged : following napoleon 's defeat , france slipped\n",

      "hi de van am pri ya ! ' thanks for this detailed post , which included some valuable information that was quite new to me . hello sp on si anus , great to hear back from you ! i definitely appreciate your words and insights . perhaps they can help us resolve this issue for good . very quickly , a few responses to your points above : . regarding maps in general - i agree , map making can be a tendentious issue . i can not justify a caliphate map , esp one which i have not seen ; however , since issue was taken with this , and it comes from the same german atlas , perhaps we could use another source for our indo - greek map . regarding pataliputra - i do believe the consensus map did just that showed an arrow leading to pataliputra . however , phg unilaterally elected to change that and imposed his original research and interpretation on that map by en ve lo ping the entire g ange tic plain . i am fine with a simple arrow going there given the debate but i do wish to bring up a number of points given the application of hindu texts to this question . a . yavanas , as indian scriptures and records both attest , was applied not just to the greeks , but many different foreigners ranging from the greeks to the arabs and the turks . sp on si anus : i am not very familiar with indian sources , and have to take your word for this . however , the wikipedia page provides several examples when indians during antiquity used the term in a manner which can certainly only mean the greeks . the arabs inherited the greek trade routes from egypt to india it is quite possible that the term y av ana posthumously came to refer to sea - fare rs from the west , just as \" rus \" was the name of the viking travellers in the east and then was transferred to a slavic people ( russians ) . as such , we must be cautious in our interpretation . moreover , the gau tam ip u tra ( a second century ce figure ) is noted as being a destroyer of sha k as , yavanas , and pa hla vas . there is no mention of the kus han as , who dominated north india during this period . this of course would lead to the logical supposition that he was referring to the kus hans who employed greeks as both ar tis ans and soldiers , and not to mention , took on aspects of greek culture themselves . this would leave open the possibility of ha thi gum pha referring to a kush ana . i am not saying this is an absolute truth . i 'm just saying that the potential exists . the kus hans , of course , having actual historical evidence ( r ab at ak , etc ) indicating their rule and reach extended that far into eastern india . sp on si anus : this is true , but neither are the kus han as mentioned in chinese sources under that name iirc they call the to ch ars as well as the kus han as the y eh - chi . no mad entities are often known under several names , and the quote above mentions sak as ( scythians ) which is a term for no mad people that certainly includes the kus hans in its wider sense . the \" proper \" sak as ( i . e . the indo - scythian tribes such as those of ma ues , az es etc , who at this period were probably long absorbed by the kus han as ) were in fact more hel len ised than the kus han as , so it seems odd that these should not be included in the term yavanas if the kus han as were . in this inscription , sha k as probably refers to tribes of no mad ancestry and yavanas to a ( certainly very indian ised ) remnant of indo - greek settlers in indian cities . this dichotomy between no mad warriors and urban citizens is well known from other n atur alised no mad kingdoms , such as the li ao and jin states in china . the pahlavi were the ( indo - ) par thians , i assume ? b . the king sag ara - an ancestor of the god king rama is credited with defeating the usual host of tribes mentioned ( including the yavanas ) . now , liberal hindu calendar estimates aside , even if we interpret this under the framework of the ait , we are at the very least looking at the epic age for such a figure ( so roughly s bce ) , and of course , much further back according to some indian historians . given this , are we to interpret that the greeks were in that part of the world that far back ? after all , the exile of ion ians by the acha emen ids would at the very earliest have taken place in the th century bce . this is the reason why i have been advising caution in the interpretations of hindu texts , be it the mahabharata , ramayana , or the yuga purana . sp on si anus : most interesting and all new to me , but are these sources credibly dated to before the hellenistic period ? mythological kings are often credited with purging the country of various foreign invaders , no matter the historical accuracy . regarding the current map - i do n't necessarily see the point of highlighting embassies ; after all , the p and yas and the kus hans also sent embassies to rome ( i do n't recall any map showing that ) . nevertheless , this is not a priority in my book given the use of circles . previously , phg was using arrows to demonstrate that which could be misunderstood for military campaigns . that is why the matter was brought up . regarding the current map proposal - it takes far too many liberties with the writings of str abo and poly bios . nar ain himself raised this points , and this map has the indo greeks reaching into mad hya pradesh and the kon kan something which can not be justified . nar ain raised questions about how tarn interpreted oz ene to be u jj ain and the reason for its listing as a conquered city was because of spelling ( see nar ain indo greeks ) . the same point applied to gujarat . and , we should note , saur ashtra refers to the peninsular region of gujarat , and not the border regions of maharashtra . what proof is there that they captured u jj ain and b har hut ? sp on si anus : i agree that the south - eastern parts of the indo - greek conquests seem less motivated than those in the north ( mathura ) . also , the \" atlas der welt geschichte \" map was actually striped for indo - greek territory , full colour only for the original bactrian kingdom . it was however based on the outdated model that all conquests took place under the long reign of de me tri os i , supported by menander as a sub - king . that map is indeed not perfect , but i have not seen any better original work . i could mail it to you so you can see for yourself . regarding coin ho ards and mathura - while large ho ards of indo greek coins have been found in various parts of northern and western india , given the commercial nature of this civilization , we must again be careful with how we interpret this . after all , menander 's coins were found as far as britain and ho ards of roman coins were found in the deccan , and we can not seriously say that both kingdoms extended that far . i believe this applies to mathura as well . i am not denying that the indo greeks could have captured mathura . however , i am saying that we can not ascertain this beyond a reasonable doubt . after all , there definitely is a chance that mathura , as with pan ch ala , was an independent vassal kingdom of the sun gas . sp on si anus : the nature of the hoard finds in eastern punjab seems to me to support that the indo - greeks indeed held this territory as their own for a long time . single coins is one thing but this evidence is far more numerous . take the am bala hoard from just north of new delhi : it contains only indo - greek coins of an tim ach us ii , menander i , stra to i , ar tem i dor os , her mai os , apo llo do tos ii and hippo str at os . those rulers span more than a century ! why did n't whoever buried that hoard include any coins of the actual rulers of am bala if these were not indo - greeks ? as a contrast , a hoard found in mathura contains only coins of stra to i . surely this indicates that the owner was on the payroll of stra to , probably as a soldier . a merchant would have gathered a more mixed hoard . the majority of indo - greek coins found in punjab were smaller denominations mostly indian dr ach ms , which were lighter than the attic standard . this indicates that we are not dealing with tribute , which would not have been paid in petty cash . several later indo - greek kings issued magnificent attic te tr ad rach ms without khar o shti inscriptions . these coins are invariably found in bac tri a and were no doubt used exclusively for dealings with the nomads there . menander 's british coin is indeed a story worthy of its own wikipedia page . but perhaps not sufficient proof of an indo - greek invasion , especially since it was found in ten by in wales . regarding your point about ethnicity - i agree ! that was one of the questions raised by nar ain . these were not pure blooded greeks who were in a bactrian bubble before rolling into india . they of course inter married with the local population and took on aspects of bactrian persian culture as well . however , that does not mean that the \" threat \" to the longevity and extent was on that count . there are very valid questions about the nature of and extent of indo greek rule in india . as yourself noted , the cer ti tude of tarn has diminished into uncertainty . sp on si anus : strange enough , raw linson , who wrote the first bactrian history around , seems to think that even kings as early as aga tho cles were more or less indians posing as greeks . he writes of menander : \" his features are coarse , and do not appear to be those of a man of pure hellenic desc ents . \" this is of course nonsense as well , but it is fascinating that the development has gone full circle . regarding other factors - nar ain points out that there is too often a he uri stic eng ra ined in approaches to this period that this was a zero sum game between the indo greeks and the sun gas . we do not appropriately account for other poli ties and tribes . the pan chal as and ma thur as ( mentioned in the yuga purana ) were seem in ly independent according to this interpretation . moreover , we have the y aud he yas in western india and the sat av ah anas in the deccan and central india . these were all trading peoples who would have exchanged goods and gold with their greek neighbors . i noticed that the sat av ah anas were not provided with the same benefit extended to the greeks , as we have confirmation of andhra rule in gujarat and central india , and they successfully invaded mag adha . sp on si anus : nevertheless , menander i is singled out in both eastern and western sources as a great conqueror . the modern chronology places menander as a considerably later king than de me tri os i , and most likely menander 's conquests did not begin until after bce , when the menace of e uc ra ti des i had disappeared . and by this period , there existed already a substantial indo - greek kingdom , as the numerous coins of apo llo do tos i indicate . this provides us with an additional indication of the greek expansion into india . because while the outdated chronology allowed us to look at menander 's conquests in the same context as the initial invasion of push kal av ati , ar ac ho sia and gandhara , we now must assume that his territorial gains begun from a base in punjab . hence , menander 's expansion if it was historical at all must have cut deep into the indian heartland . my personal view is that the fact that menander was remembered at all , along with his immense output of coins , could indicate that the indo - greek kingdom was briefly the vast empire that str ab on describes . but as said , i agree that the southern extensions of the map are possibly ex ag err ated . regarding the german map - since sub j ec tivities are again an issue , that is why i recommend the map that windy city dude brought up ( oxford map ) . his lack of depth in the topic aside , the dude provided us with a published work with the most accurate presentation of the indo greek kingdom free from debate . on the point of sialkot , as nar ain ( who i must again reference on account of his original critique of the existing framework ) points out , we have no clear evidence that sak ala was in fact the capital city of menander . after all , the div y av ad ana credits pus hy ami tra 's rule extending as far as that city . sp on si anus : the mi lind ap an ha begins by stating that \" mi linda was the king in the city of sag ala \" . why should it claim that , if menander for instance had taxila as his capital ? and the chronological shift works here as well : if menander 's rule began in bce , pus hy ami tra might well have ruled the city during the earlier part of his reign . anyway , the map windy city dude suggested is an overview of various powers in northern india for about half a millenium . however well respected the source , a map of that type does not focus on details . the map e qu alled the indo - greek and the gra eco - bactrian kingdoms that alone should disqualify it for use here . and it was earlier ( ) than atlas der welt geschichte . i am not saying that i necessarily subscribe to nar ain 's point , but that the versions proposed by previous wiki contributors may not be so ridiculous after all . while i know that phg 's complaint was that windy city dude has not read poly bios or str abo , phg was also mis characterizing nar ain 's wor ka seminal work which he had not read ! nevertheless , this is minutiae . my point here is that we can address these various scenarios in the article ; however , the map itself , because of its proliferation on the web , should be representative of modern scholarship in the interest of accuracy . we should have a map that we call agree represents indo greek holdings beyond a reasonable doubt . all subsequent scenarios , theories , and possibilities should be addressed on the actual article . while i think we appeared to have solved one issue ( namely with the campaign arrow to pataliputra ) , i believe we have ex ac er b ated another . the extension into the northern deccan and central india can not be supported with current evidence . after all , the sat av ah anas lost those regions not to the indo greeks but to the sha k as . if you believe otherwise , could you please refer me to the evidence that proves it is so ? on the question of mathura . my responses above raised some concerns about its inclusion ; in the interests of resolution , and since this was , by phg 's admission , a shorter term expansion if it did happen ( back in indian hands by bce and taken by menander ca s ) , perhaps you could suggest some sort of compromise here . sp on si anus : no , the thirty years are based on a mis dating of str aton i , who was certainly not the son of menander i ( another one of tarn 's assumptions , unfortunately repeated by bo pear ach chi ) and as mentioned had his coins found in mathura . str aton i ( who may in fact be two kings ) ruled perhaps until the s bce , and there as mentioned coins of other late kings found even further east . that is why the interpretation that am yn tas was the king of the ha thi gu mpa inscription makes so much sense . am yn tas was the last ruler whose coins are found both in bac tri a and punjab . mathura might well have been in greek hands until apo llo do tos ii ( c . - bc ) , who in fact was one of the most important kings , even though his rule was exclusively east of the indus . the later chronology is indeed in need of some serious re - arranging : phg has worked according to bo pear ach chi , for lack of better comprehensive works on the topic , but str aton has to be altered sooner or later for he is distorting the entire later history . some of my own earlier speculations based on this must be removed as well . perhaps a newer revision could be based on robert senior 's \" end of the indo - greeks \" . best regard sps if you have n't already , you should check out the yahoo hel len is tica group where there are very interesting discussions on the indo - greeks . i am e gil . ds indo - greeks : summary hello again de van am pri ya ! first of all a technical question : some of your posts , at least on my browser , tend to come out as boxes with an elongated single line . do you know why this is the case ? a . the ma pi hope you received the map from atlas der welt geschichte . as you can see , it uses striped purple lines for the indo - greek kingdom , whole colour for the bactrian kingdom . ar ac ho sia is marked as belonging to the latter , which probably was true in bc , the date the map is centered around . however , this atlas frequently uses the striped lines to represent disputed territory . perhaps i should have told phg this , for the representation is perhaps somewhat ambiguous . the southern parts are certainly meant to represent the kingdoms of sar ao stus , and si ger dis . the part which i think you may be correct to doubt is the territory around u ds che in ( u jj ain ) . however , oz ene should be the same city like tarn says , since per ip lus states that oz ene lies \" inland east \" of bar y gaza just like u jj ain does . nevertheless , the per ip lus does not mention greek influence there , only in bar y gaza where coins with symbols of menander and apo llo dotus ( or rather the apo llo to di , i & ii ) were abundant . i do not even recall tarn mentioning oz ene as a greek city , but there seems to be few indications that this was ever the case . but in any case , this leaves us with a relatively small fraction of the map being dubious the part northeast of bar y gaza . the dates on the map are of course also outdated but please note that these are based on tarn 's speculations about the intrinsic relations between different indo - greek kings . they have nothing to do with the foundations for the extension of the indo - greek kingdom which is based on interpretations of ancient sources . tarn then \" distributed \" the conquests among de me tri us , menander and e uc ra ti des , according to how he believed they were related . hence while the dates are obsolete , the overall picture not necessarily so . phg did of course remove the dates when he modified the map . i have stated before what is wrong with the oxford map and i stand by this . b . on the term y av ana . you are certainly correct that y av ana yon aka has a sanskrit root as many indoeuropean words indeed have . nevertheless , yon aka was a version of a name the ( jon ian ) greeks gave themselves , and an example of a word that has left the ancient sanskrit , only to come back meaning just \" greek \" or \" foreigner \" . just as today , i assume that indians use a variation of the same greek word ( ion ) meaning \" e lec tri cally charged particle \" , without thinking much about its original sanskrit root . the persians also used a version of the term yon aka for greeks , and for sources from the hellenistic era , i still maintain this is its general meaning . the arabs gradually took over the greek trade routes . this begun already in late antiquity . before the arab language became global after the rise of the caliphate , arab travellers often spoke greek . in fact , the hellenistic impact on the early islamic civilisation was considerable and greek was an official language of the early caliphate . this is perhaps forgotten today . the indians did as you mention also travel west wards , but it seems as though the interaction with the gra eco - roman world ceased during late antiquity . the last indians to visit the byzantine empire were iirc in the days of an ast asi us ( c . ad ) , where an embassy was registered . and in those days , the line between ethnic greeks and greek - speaking people was certainly blurred in fact it is very consequent that the indian understanding of the term yavanas was similarly wi dened to include the arabs , the new rulers of those greek territories ( egypt etc ) which were in contact with india . in fact , the double nature of greek interaction with india , first via bac tri a and then , after the discovery of the mon soon , via the mediterranean , also gives the word y av ana two distinct meanings . apart from the language , syrian egyptian and bactrian yavanas may have been very different people indeed . c . menander 's conquests . i heartily disagree with your suggestion that menander 's conquests were limited to punjab . there are several indications con ver ging , which all emphasise menander 's eastern expansion . sources . menander is explicitly despite the general lack of info on indo - greek kings - mentioned by str ab on , who is generally thought to be a most reliable source , and probably had first hand contact with greek and indian merchants a mere century after menander . and as you know , he explicitly mentions pataliputra , as well as the indian coast land \" the rest of the coast \" . this is not a description of petty conquests in jammu . then there is the reference to sag ala in mi lind ap ah na which indicates though not certainly as you point out that menander was based in eastern punjab . that such was the case is supported by the fact that e uc ra ti des , whom we know was a contemporary of menander , ruled in the western part of the indo - greek kingdom . another king who was a contemporary of menander was zo il us i ( menander over struck zo il us i , so perhaps he reigned - bce ) ; he was also a \" western \" king whose coins are rarely found in punjab . finally there is justin 's \" de me tri us , king of indians \" , possibly another king who ruled west of menander , since it was he who fought with the bactrian e uc ra ti des . so menander 's str on gh olds were clearly in eastern punjab , for push kal av ati and gandhara were over taken by other kings at least twice in his reign . the yuga purana source may be obscure as you point out , but nevertheless its description of the yavanas supports exactly what we have from str abo a greek attack on pataliputra . the civil war which forced the greeks to leave is also well supported by authors like justin . and the mention of siege engines which were a specialty of the greeks is a third concrete , verifiable detail . what more could we ask from historical sources , than a consensus of writers from different continents ? menander certainly attacked pataliputra though how long he held it is another story . the importance of coins i know of at least four major ho ards found in eastern punjab which are exclusively indo - greek ( of course there are many more coins ) : am bala and son ip at north of delhi . both contain a different mix of exclusively greek kings spanning from ca - bce . then there is the mathura hoard with only pieces of str aton i , and a similar hoard close to mathura mentioned by tarn , consisting only of dr ach ms of menander . a fifth hoard of akh no or in eastern punjab contains late kings from apo llo do tos ii - str aton iii , as well as some k sh at ra pa coins . note that all these five ho ards end with different rulers , i . e . they were likely buried during different periods . of course there is the possibility that a single hoard was buried by a refugee or a merchant who travelled abroad , but the overall impact can not be dismissed that easily . while abundance of indo - greek coins is not in itself sufficient to prove they ruled a specific territory , in a more general sense it t esti fies to their importance . striking many coins means controlling vast resources , which in its turn indicates the importance of the indo - greek kings . finally there are indo - greek kings whose coins are not found in eastern punjab at all : for instance zo il us i , nic ias , the op hi lus , ar tem i dor us and ar che bius , who was nevertheless a rather important king . obviously there were eastern and western states within the indo - greek territory . so if you suggest that the punjab coins of for instance str aton i were found east of his actual dominion , you have to consider the opposite opinion as well : that coins found in gandhara or push kal av ati could in fact have been exported to the west by a king ruling in eastern punjab ! much of your criticism voices concerns the validity of single pieces of evidence . while such criticism is certainly not unfounded the overall picture imho supports a consistent greek rule in eastern punjab . d . suggestion ' i am willing to accept that the territory of u jj ain is a bit too speculative . if there is no problem with \" original research \" i suppose that phg could modify this on the welt geschichte map . that will however lead us to a map that is rather similar to the current one which you objected against only with the pataliputra expedition marked only as an arrow . the mathura territory should however remain . i have presented a few more modern arguments which i hope are convincing enough to support this view\n",

      "let 's try a middle in fielder alan tram m ell , cer ti fi ably a good hitter with some defensive value . was he ever regarded as the best player in baseball ? did anybody , while he was active , ever suggest that he was the best player in baseball ? that is a very tough standard . in , he was arguably the best player in the game , and he had one of the greatest seasons that any short stop ever had off en sively and that includes vaughan , banks , rip ken , y ount , and je ter . but that is a freak season in a career not quite as stellar as those hall of fam ers . nobody is going to compare him off en sively to all - time tigers as offensive players not to cobb , kal ine , heil man , greenberg , or crawford . was he the best player on his team ? maybe , and maybe not . if he was n't the best , he was close to the best , with a bunch of players ( typically morris , whitaker , par rish , and at times gibson or hernandez ) . in he was clearly the best player on the team and arguably better than the fellow who got the american league mvp , george bell . was he the best player in baseball at his position ? was he the best player in the league at his position ? close , but no cigar , except in when he exceeded even cal rip ken . did he have an impact on a number of pennant races ? the tigers were pennant contenders throughout most of the s , and tram m ell was much above average . short stop is typically a difficult position to fill with an above - average offensive player , and it is easy to see that the tigers would have been in contention with a short stop hitting about . with little power only in . tram m ell was one of the reasons for there being no meaningful pennant race in the american league east in , which is one way to answer the question ; in the tigers would not have been in contention without his one spectacular year . was he a good enough player that he could continue to play regularly after passing his prime ? he played until age . he did play regularly until his mid - s and had some gau dy averages . is he the very best player in baseball history who is not in the hall of fame ? nobody is going to compare him to shoe less joe jackson or pete rose who are excluded from the hall of fame for reasons other than statistics . he is n't barry bonds or roger clemens , neither of whom is yet to become eligible , and are both either automatic selections if they are n't banned from baseball for some offense . it 's hard to compare him to a pitcher like bly le ven or morris . if you are looking at middle in fi el ders he is probably after barry larkin and possibly craig big gio , but definitely above lou whitaker ( see below ) and dave con c ep cion . he has some advantages over buddy bell , a stellar third bas eman for defense but who played almost all his career for teams that missed the playoffs by a huge margin . are most players who have comparable career statistics in the hall of fame ? i 'd say about half . do the player 's numbers meet hall of fame standards ? he is a better offensive player than o zzie smith or luis ap ar ici o , but without the stellar offense . much will be said of omar vi z quel as a contrast tp him . he would not be even in consideration for the hall of fame except as a middle in fielder or catcher with such statistics . he would not be in consideration for the hall of fame except as a middle in fielder or a catcher . is there any evidence to suggest that the player was significantly better or worse than is suggested by his statistics ? he played his entire career in tiger stadium , a park that gives few cheap home runs to right - handed hitters and reduces averages for any line - drive hitter . contrast his team mate lou whitaker , a fly ball hitter who hit lots of home runs off the right - field over hang in tiger stadium . that park also allowed him to play short stop far longer than otherwise . if he had played in a park with artificial turf he might have hit for a better average , but he might not have been a short stop . injuries ? he had lots of them , but those are not to be considered . they may have cut down his play , but did not shorten his career . is he the best player at his position who is eligible for the hall of fame but not in ? barry larkin probably takes precedence . barry larkin belongs in the hall of fame , too . how many mvp - type seasons did he have ? did he ever win an mvp award ? if not , how many times was he close ? ? high average with middle - range power by a short stop , but there were short stops robin y ount and cal rip ken having some great seasons . ? not his best year , but effective . ? finished second . how many all - star - type seasons did he have ? how many all - star games did he play in ? did most of the other players who played in this many go to the hall of fame ? he might have had more had he not been on a good team ( see buddy bell ) . if this man were the best player on his team , would it be likely that the team could win the pennant ? he was at times , and there was . but he had ( contrast dale murphy ) teammates themselves close to him in value . what impact did the player have on baseball history ? was he responsible for any rule changes ? did he introduce any new equipment ? did he change the game in any way ? no . if he does so it will be as a manager , which he has not yet done . his record as a manager is entirely with sub - . teams , including the pu tri d - record of the detroit tigers , so that is no help . he does n't look joe tor re as a manager yet . did the player uphold the standards of sports manship and character that the hall of fame , in its written guidelines , instructs us to consider ? nothing remarkable to his detriment or favor\n",

unfounded de mag ogy of dc on stalin , etc . - moldavian language in moldavia during soviet union used cyrillic alphabet ( by the way , another proof that there were two languages used in moldavia and not one , as dc says - russian ) , the name in cyrillic is given for reference . besides , it is about encyclopedia and not pejorative cono tations . moldopodo . the name of the city in russian there are two formulas used : and . moldopodo erases the reference to the second formula . it is used on the building i den ti fications in the city , including the city hall , it is used on the web page of the mayor of the city ( who by the way is an ethnic ukrainian like moldopodo ) . i am not contesting that outside the city the other formula is prefered more often . i would not oppose a footnote indicating the frequency of the useage of each form . * additionally : we can have a section names of the city and write all that there . in the intro , we can leave only current names . moldopodo 's answer shows that he fails to understand the problem : is in russian , not only in moldavian romanian cyrillic . of course , if people would agree to simply forget it , one would eliminate a lot of confusion : balti - in romanian and english , - in russian , and fin ita la com edia . but , if the administration in the city uses , we have to mention it somewhere in the text of the article . : * additionally : is already mentioned in the intro , where is the problem ? and for determination of the right word in russian it 's not b l i administration who decides , but a relevant body in russia . besides b l i was and still is mentioned in english as belt sy in numerous documents and internet as well . moldopodo * i see this as more of a problem for ru : wiki . since this is the english wikipedia , only the most common names used in english should be given here -

of the moldavian parliament ( the dif fin ition of the territorial units , their names and composition ; a law which can be found on the webpage of the parliament ; all laws are brought there up to date on a daily basis , that is , small changes are entered into the texts of the laws on the day of their add option - you can read all that stuff on the webpage of the parliament , it is a very strict procedure ) , moldova is divided into municipalities , ra ions , autonomous territorial unit , and special territorial unit . balti is one of the municipalities not sub or din ated to other units ( there is even a [ wiki link : administrative divisions of moldova wikipedia article ] explaining all that ) . the capital cities of the territorial units also have municipality status ( it is about the degree of financial autonomy ) , but unlike balti , those municipalities are not first tier territorial units of the country . legally and colo qu ally , the word municipality has two meanings : one of the first tier units , or one of the cities with that status . saying balti is one of or one of is giving preference to one notion over the other . much more correct would be to say balti is a municipality . i am not saying one can not elaborate on that , if you wish , but without giving preference to one of the two notions . * additionally : you can also see the template at the bottom of the article . you editted and deleted half the article without even reading it first . * additionally : well , then the template is wrong also and i will change it . there are five municipalities , not and not four . it 's basic mathematics . your info is good to be put in an article on moldavian municipalities , where you may explain the tier dif fe ren cies . moldopodo * disagree with dc - anyway , dc contradicts herself himself . it is clear the total number of municipalities in mod lo va is five and not more or less . consequently b l i is one of five municipalities . moldopodo . it is often referred to as \" the capital of the north \" this was a proposal by some politicians , to add into moldovan legislation these words . it was opposed on the grounds that it says nothing specifically . it would be like giving in the con si tu tion of the new york state \" new york city is the capital of the south of the state \" . so , there is no such legal definition in moldova . however , those politicians have continued a pr cam pain to promote it . the ordinary citizens are led to believe that should the city receive such status , it would allow something that would allow to improve the economics of the city . but it would allow nothing , as there is no law about \" capitals of the north \" or \" capitals \" or sm th similar . it is a cheap way to blame some deficits of city administration of someone else , indefinite . now , i am not saying we can not cover these aspects in the article . but to say in the first paragraph of the article , and to state it like a definition , is to add opt a political view . i think a wikipedia article should not do that . a small paragraph about that down throught the text is ok by me . * additionally : please , re - read my last sentence , just bolded . my objection is the presence of that in the intro , and to saying it correctly , i . e . not \" often \" but \" sometimes \" or \" some people call it \" . often means several times a day , which is not true . the fact is the name is not used outside the limits of the city , ) , and inside only by a small minority of inhabitants ( equally distributed among the ethnic groups ) [ for references that moldopodo wants , i would have to find all the interviews and de cl ar tions of the current mayor and of some businessmen , mainly k . , i forgot his name , he now sold his businesses and relocated to ukraine . and i do n't have days to find all their w ri ttings , many of which might not be on internet at all . i believe moldopodo has read them . ] * disagree - dc , again you are missing the point , it 's not about politics , please read the answers that are given to you . my city is referred to as a capital of the north or northern capital even on numerous internet sites , not only in english , russian or romanian . this is simply obvious . i invite you again to check google . moldopodo * do n't see the problem with it . it 's not like anyone 's going to relocate the capital there or something . i 'd suggest the \" northern capital \" , though . * disagree with dc -

[ wiki link : di mi trie can tem ir ] has described , among hundreds of other things , the flora and f oun a of the region , and he described a secular forrest with trees of big diameter . it would be very nice if that would be the situation today , but it is i logical to say it is covered with for rests now . * dc is correct here , afaik . * agree and i did not really have a problem with this . i guess it was left out in front of all the edits . moldopodo . in the middle of the [ wiki link : b l i steppe ] . this is a phrase that moldopodo keeps adding , and i keep deleting it . unfortunately , it is a politically motivated notion . the russian descriptions often used it , and they consider it as part of the southern - russian steppe . in international literature , one cal les the \" southern - russian steppe \" asian steppe , or eurasian steppe . wikipedia also uses the international terminology : [ wiki link : eurasian steppe ] , and its component [ wiki link : pontic - caspian steppe ] . according to the international literature and maps , the steppe lies mani ly to the east of the river dniester ( all the way to northern china ) , with only a small band along the black see shore on the western bank of dniester being steppe , which is - km from the city . the change in the relief and vegetation is quite sudden at the river dniester , and is due to the start of the pre - car path ian area . this is a well - known scientific fact . however , in the second half of the th century , when the notion balti steppe has appeared ( under the influence of the pan - slavist current in the russian empire ) , there were not so many geologists and travellers through the region . therefore , the idea that the steppe continues on the western shore of the dniester took hold in some literature due to its agressive promotion by the pan - slavist current . in the wake of deforestation of large areas in northern moldova in th century , this can be observed even by a child : the re ver s and creeks make deep g org es , but if you look at the - km areas between neighboring creeks , you see easy hills . as you go more to the south , these hills are more abrupt , up to slopes , but in the north , you have a slope . so , each of these - km areas look like bomb ated step ps ( only by relief , not by the traditional vegetation , which here are woods , not pra iries ) . but then , at creeks , one has big g org es , with - slopes . it is incorrect to call the whole of northern moldova steppe . it is not a traditional pra iries . you can find some areas up to - square miles in size that look like steppe , but not the whole north of the country . if you wish , see also the article geography of moldova for more details . * additionally : the pan - slavist origin i just gave for your information , i do not oppose it because it was pan - slavist , but because it is factually false . ( not everything pan - sla vists came with was false . ) for the article , the only thing it is relevant : it is not factual , it is not a [ wiki link : prairie ] . [ to moldopodo : what \" russian cono tation \" has the word steppe ? if you see a russian pan - slavist ( not all russians were pan - slavist in th century , there were equally strong currents ) cono tation , then yourself betray that you know that the term was invented . ] * do n't see how a neutral geographic description like \" b l i steppe \" ( not even \" belt skaya steppe \" ) can be pan - slavist , but whatever . if it 's factual - leave it be . if it 's factually incorrect - keep it out . * disagree - again unfounded de mag ogy of dc - to correct me , state me one source and link where it is said that b l i steppe is a pan - slavist or political or something like that . i guess you just do n't like the fact that the word is of russian origin ? b l i steppe is officially recorded by numerous sources ( check internet , britannica encyclopedia , etc . ) and has no specific political or russian con ota ion . and even if it had one ( i ca n't see which ) , would you call then mountain a river ? i dis ag ee and remind you , it 's about encylopedia and not your im ag in tion , dc . moldopodo . eli sa ve ta , moldova eliza ve ta and sad o voe , moldova sad o voe vs eliza ve tov ca and sad o voe there are two issues here . one , there sure are localities called sad o voe in other countries , and could be the same for eliza ve ta . second , the moldovan law xv - on the administrative division of the country calls it eliza ve ta . eliza ve tov ca was the name used during the soviet union , the name in russian . * you tell me , moldopodo , there is no other sad o voe in the whole world ?

tell honestly ! if you do n't know the language of your own country even at a very - very simple level , proved by the fact that even with a dictionary you make mistakes in a word that means the name of the city you live in , then please . give us a brake with your super - knowledge of the language you do n't bother learn even at an elementary level . you have to translate \" bal ta \" from romanian to english , not swamp from english to romanian . you found a dictionary that does not even have \" bal ta \" - it is a dictionary in construction ! here is a good online dictionary , i 've used it for - years : [ externa link : http : www . diction are . com ] . alternatively , go to the library , pick up a dictionary , and make a small effort to learn a few words in the official language of your own country . it is a very simple language to learn , it is not chinese or hungarian to have to learn from zero . foreigners come to moldova and in year speak the language . you live there for years and do n't bother . instead you blame people of nationalism . and what is your lack of knowledge of romanian , not nationalism ? noone asks you to write literature , but , - , words anyone can learn . : * disagree . by the way , something tells me that romanian version ( balt ) of swamp is somehow related to russian version of swamp ( bo lo to ) . as for translation , i will not fall into an empty of sense debate full of de mag ogy and will simply invite everybody check the english romanian dictionary on line ( http : www . ec taco . co . uk english - romanian - dictionary ) . please type in \" swamp \" . the translation is mla tin , balt , sm rc . moldopodo let 's take a look at [ external link : dex ] , the official romanian - language dictionary . dex defines balt as : . n tin dere de ap st t to are , de ob ic ei nu pre a ad nc , av nd o vegeta ie i o fau n ac va tic specific ; zon de lun c in und abil , cu loc uri n care stag ne az apa ; p . ext . lac . ap de plo ai e ad un at n tr - o ad n ci tur ; gro ap cu ap sau mo cir l ; ( prin ex ag er are ) can tit ate mare de li chi d v r sat pe jos ; b l to ac . stretch of still water , usually not too deep , having a specific kind of aquatic vegetation and fauna ; forest zone prone to flooding , with places where water stag n ates ; by extension , a lake . rain water gathered into a ditch ; hole containing water or muck ; ( by exaggeration ) a great quantity of water spilled on the ground ; puddle . make of this what you will . . moldavian language vs romanian language this is a politically motivated scandal that goes on for years . its trace on wikipedia is in fact smaller that the real scandal , which is very ugly . in short , the moldavian law uses three terms for the language : * moldavian , with the existence of a mol do - romanian identity unity ( language law of ) * romanian ( declaration of independence ) * moldavian ( constitution ) the origin lies in the stalin 's decision in to introduce the term moldavian language . it was to help him gain bessarabia , which then was part of romania . this decision was practically implemented in , when the area was occupied by the soviet military . during the soviet time , the usage of the word romanian language was equivalent to extremist nationalism , while the usage of the word romanian was qualified by the authorities as fascism ( there were people that were condemned for years of labour in siberia for \" fascism \" for answering to the judge \" i am romanian \" ) . as a result , when the soviet system fell , people were afraid to use it . a more neutral formulation \" limba de stat \" ( \" state language \" or \" official language \" ) was and still is largely used . by , the fear of \" romanian \" has past . in , a political setback has occured , and the word \" moldavian language \" was introduced in the constitution . since then , the issue of content has been that many people , countries , also eu , object to the usage of a term invented by stalin 's request and a pro val . the term \" romanian language \" is currently widely used , including in all the education system of moldova ( all manuals are called romanian language ) . a more neutral \" the official language of moldova \" is used in delicate situations . the problem for our article is that moldopodo did not introduce the term moldavian language until his last edits : he accepted the standard international ter min ol ory ( romanian language ) before , and only after the disagreements of op pin ions have occured on other issues , he introduced these changes . this is a sign of increased demands and increased agre ssi veness when there are cont ra di tions . it is not something specific to moldopodo only . it is the traditional soviet way of negotiating : they tell you x . if you do n't accept it , they demand x y . they add y as a revenge that you de ared contradict them . i can also add other demands that i think ought to be discussed , but because there are many issues in discussion here , i limited to the essential ones . we can discuss other issues later , when there is a history of mutual col ab or ation , it would be easier to frankly and openly talk then . and i am prepared to wait ( even forever if necessary ) and not introduce these other demands unless discussing them beforehand , and receiving agreement . but i am not introducing them now , because i want a civilized concensus , not an eternal edit war . on the same tok ken , i object to the increased demands , a policy of \" revenge \" used for agressive \" nego ci ations \" . * additionally : to illythr : i meant to say on stalin 's request and by his a pro val . sorry , i corrected my slef . how about we use \" moldavian romanian \" consistently on wikipedia ? politically , the issue will still go on for years , and it is a pit ty to come back to it again and again on wp . to moldopodo : please read , the language law , and the declaration independence , where it is written black on white that romanian is the official language of moldova . : * again , stalin himself did n't invent or even introduce it . as for usage - i think that administrative issues should use \" moldovan \" and linguistic ones - \" romanian \" . * : actually , stalin requested the change of moldovan alphabet to latin in the early s . this development was later reversed , but i have no info on whether stalin had any active personal involvement there , or just gave the go ahead to initiatives of local ap par at chi ks . * disagree . again too much de mag ogy , what does soviet negation have to do with this , x , y , z , what 's next ? however , the encyclopedia facts are simple . please check all valid moldavian legislation and find at least one word \" romanian \" . off cially the language is called moldavian .

dc , vandalising this article tries to present falsified history . moldopodo * : ) vandalism is disruption of wikipedia for the purpose of causing mayhem . that is not what dc does . * : ) sure , moldovan was present everywhere , but russian dominated , especially in cities . . negation that anti - communist demonstrations has taken place . labeling ethnic moldavians , as a community , with extremism . - b l i is known as the \" quiet city \" of moldova . only four public demonstrations take place in the city during this period , none gathering more than , . the main reform - oriented part of the population was formed by the students and faculty of the local university , which regularly gathered indoors , sometimes numbering several thousands . was replaced by - b l i is known as the \" quiet city \" of moldova . regular peaceful demonstrations and gatherings take place around the lenin monument in order to support the old system and keep the language balance . a couple of demonstrations are organised from chi in u by representatives of the extreme right organisation national front with slogans like \" baggage - station - russia \" , meaning pack your baggage , go to the train station , and go to russia , a message to the russian speaking moldavians . this is pro - soviet propaganda , as it is outrageous even to claim that : there were never regular demonstrations in the city , it was \" the quiet city \" . when the soviet authorities learned about the preparation of each of the demon trations , they organized one on the same date and same our , and try to end it in - minutes . each time , when asked to go home , the people when to the tri bun es from which the soviet ap par at chicks spoke to them half hour , took the micro phones from the ose , and continued for another - hours . then , the demonstrations ended with marches \" jos mafia \" ( \" down with the mafia \" ) from the city hall to the university . also , ee are not talking about chis in au here , but about balti . labeling an entire ethnic community with using a slogan that . of them oppose is soviet propaganda ! the russian and ukrainian communities have never been labeled of persecuting the ethnic majority , of sho vin ism . it was the soviet leadership and individual sy mp ath y zers that were blamed of sho vin ism . it is very un si vi lized to add labels to whole ethnic communities . the majority never cal les for \" baggage - station - russia \" , some der a ined individuals did , and were immediately opposed by the people . it is the faithful continuation of the policy of calling one fascist for calling oneself romanian . * proper sourcing should solve this issue , i believe . * disagree with dc - any proof , source , link ? besides , dc has deleted the edit : the pression to set moldavian as the only one language turned into separation of eastern can tons of moldavia and creation of a break - away republic . moldopodo local elections since all local elections are won by the old [ wiki link : soviet ] apparatus candidates , the russian minority being stronger politically not least because of its higher turnout rate . however the policies of the local authorities have evolved from one individual to the next , so that although extreme left by today 's standards , some of them would have been considered quite liberal in [ wiki link : soviet ] times . * disagree with dc as far as the text in bold is concerned - any proof , source , link ? moldopodo currently , the municipal activity is done in russian and romanian , in disregard with the national language [ wiki link : law ] , which states that romanian moldavian is the only official language of the country . * disagree with dc - any proof , source , link ?

moldova , not romania is there home . aqu iring romanian citizenship does not mean to \" rep at ri ate \" anywhere . * disagree with dc - any proof , source , link ? i know plenty of moldavians who received romanian citizenship and left for romania for good , from b l i namely , because they identified themselves with romanians and romania , just as some russians and ukrainians did . now , is that an info to be put on an encyclopedia ? also it is just another false statement by dc that people had to renounce moldavian citizenship to go to ukraine or russia . people who left for russ sia and ukraine had for home moldova as well , they were born in moldova , but had to flee in front of people like dc , outright national sts , trying to assimilate everything to romanian and to rewrite the history on the expense of people 's lives . moldopodo . erasing that there were doubts about the accuracy of census from now on , this is old stuff , not as revenge . n . b . the accuracy of the census data was questioned by international observers , as the census officials , possibly motivated by financial short ages or political considerations , often filled in approximate figures , based on police data , rather than questioning large portions of population . however , the trends , proportions , phenomena put into evidence by the census data were not questioned , as the filling in was mainly due to economic situation . this is a necessary information imho . expressing the same with different words is ok . note , it is about accuracy not correctness . * disagree with dc - this article is about b l i with the statistical data submitted by state administration . if you have a link , verifiable source that questions this census write an article on this census and put it in there . such comments have no place on the article about b l i proper . moldopodo . estimations according to the romanian official estimations for , based on the census of , the city had around , people . was erased by moldopodo . * do n't see the need to delete it . * disagree with dc - we need a link and a verifiable source here . moldopodo . . in , another romanian census was carried out , however its data was not processed because of the [ wiki link : soviet occupation of bessarabia and northern bu ko vina soviet occupation ] . preliminary data suggested cca , inhabitants . v sin another romanian census was carried out , however its data was never processed because of the beginning of the [ wiki link : world war ii ] the military action of wwii started in the region on june . the wwii in the world has started on september . the census was taken \" as on january \" . start od wwii in poland was not a hinder . the data was not finished to be processed because on june soviet tr ou ps have entered . the word \" occupation \" is used because that is the title of a specific wikipedia article about the events . * disagree with dc - we need a link and a verifiable source here ( on this census , its date and other important details ) . anyway , that 's the version that was on russian wikipedia , which i find much more neutral and positive as an article . moldopodo . ethnic composition according to census i understand that it was cl asi fied and crime to write that information during the soviet period . but what is wrong of writing it now ?

' : registering should n't require commitment either . if even one person registers with the intent to use their account later , and finds their account deleted when they finally find the time , then unless the decision has improved the speed of the servers by a significant amount , it is a failure . : oppose ninety days is too short . learning to have an interest in and a commitment to wikipedia will take longer than a year for many . i have been using wp for a couple of years . i started and account to fix some stuff i saw . i still am a green horn about how to do a lot of stuff . putting in a obstacle for people with busy lives is just an unnecessary hurdle . if an account lies untouched for a year , then i think it makes more sense . right idea . too short a horizon : if you fixed some stuff you saw with your account , then your account will never be deleted . please read the proposed policy carefully . ' : you need to log in before this vote can count . oppose this is lu dac rious ( incivility removed ) there is no reason to delete inactive accounts that have yet to make an edit within days ! a non - editing account 's computer may break down , disabling a log - in w in days ! if not the case , it should n't matter anyway , as registered accounts should be left alone . : calling wikipedians you do n't agree with nazis is not only against [ wiki link : wikipedia : civility ] it is also simply rude . oppose emailing would n't work as email is optional , i believe . i would n't like to log - in to any site finding my account is gone ! when necessary , an usurper can be pe formed . : no it ca n't . oppose . this does n't seem to have much benefit to the project compared to the amount of effort involved and feels like an attempt to snag some usernames ( ie first names ) that were taken several years ago and are inactive . : if they are inactive , and never edited , then why should they be kept ? i do n't understand the objection . oppose editing is not the only way we can help wikipedia . : could you clarify what you mean by this ? * i think he means that if we do something like donate to wikipedia , then we are helping as well , and that we do n't have to actually participate in order to help out . : * maybe he means that you can proofread without editing ? or talk wikipedia up to others ? i really ca n't think of a way to help , other than actual editing , that would require you to keep a username from which you never made an edit , and to which you did n't even sign in for more than days at a time . strong oppose . there are many valid reasons to have accounts with no edits ; to keep your preferences , to have an alternate watchlist , to have the same username on several projects ( there are people with accounts on all the wikipedias ) , to reserve a username ( like and the doppelganger usernames ) , and so on . just because someone has not logged in in a while , it does not mean he should lose his account . and emailing the owner of the accounts is n't enough ; we have accounts without an email address , unconfirmed email addresses , dead email addresses ( some people forget to change it when they change isps ) , agressive spam filters , broken email servers , and so on . oppose i really do appreciate what you 're trying to accomplish here , and it took me awhile to decide my vote , but in the end , in actual practice it does n't seem to serve a useful purpose . all that vandals sockpuppets will have to do is make one \" legitimate \" edit with their fake account and the account is safe for future use . meanwhile , legitimate users who , for whatever reasons , register and then not edit , risk losing their account . and of the , zero - edit accounts , how many were purely unused , and how many were simply d op pel gang ers ? plus , i imagine the number of unregistered vandal - user edits far outweighs the number of \" stale \" accounts , so the time resources needed to pull this off seems a low priority in my opinion . : there are ways to mark [ wiki link : wikipedia : doppelganger account doppelganger accounts ] , which requires making an edit to the account 's userpage . and since an edit was made to the page , the account can no longer be deleted . while anonymous edits by unregistered users may be a problem , this is just as much a problem . : i , um , know that . what i asked was , \" how many ? \" it 's been said that there around , ' zero - edit ' accounts , but how may of those are doppelganger accounts that simply have n't put the ' d op pel - template ' on their page ? is there even a way to know ? for all we know only , - , accounts are truly ' stale ' , that 's hardly an epidemic for a site accessed worldwide . like i said , the vandals are the ones who 'll know the rules better than the newbies , and will exploit the obvious loopholes ( i 'm not even a vandal , and i can see many ways to abuse this if it became policy . ) like i said , it is a good idea on paper ( on the screen ? ) , but in practice it 's simply not going to do any good , and only creates one more thing for vandals to mess around with , especially the sockpuppet variety . further , i find it really hard to believe that this is as big of a problem as non - registered user vandalization . oppose days is too short , once i had an eye injury and c ou l dent read , use the computer , or watch the tv for months : two months is only days . days is months and the proposed days is months . i do not see what is so complicated about that . i know it may be hard to see that sometimes , but wanted to clarify that . strongly support ! : did you mean to put this in the support section ? oppose at least until single - login is implemented . there has to be a reason we have - non - editing accounts , and without knowing what it is , i 'm loathe to change the status quo . i do n't actually see what it 's harming , and the way for vandals to get around it ( for the examples ) is trivial . sorry . : given your \" single - login \" objection , how about if we agree ( for starters ) to only erase usernames that do not exist on any other wikiproject ? : i 'm a sucker for data . the figure is an out lier for me , and i want to know why . for example , how many of those no - edit accounts exist under the same username on other wikia projects ? how many have items on their watchlist ? how does the creation rate compare pre - no - ip - page - creation and post - no - ip - page - creation ? how many names appear ( and this is subjective ) to be spam accounts ( random strings of characters , for a start ) ? oppose will hurt people who login only for the preferences and the watchlist who have to go away for a while . time period is too short . also will affect people on other projects re serving user names . : * oppose the time until delete should be longer for accounts with more edits . if it has only a few edits on one or two articles , days is fine . if it has significantly more edits to more articles , more consideration should be given to longstanding users who might end up on a wikibreak . : * : please read the proposal more carefully . accounts with any edits can not be deleted at all . ergo , an account with \" a few edits on one or two articles \" can not be deleted . this proposal only applies to accounts from which no edits have ever been made , and who have not logged in to their account for over days . : * : i misunderstood the policy , and my opposition has been re sc en ded . sorry ! oppose , i 'm \" parking \" user : cyde on many other language wikis to prevent impersonation , and under these guidelines , those would end up being deleted . likewise , people who speak other languages and are parking their user accounts here to prevent impersonation should n't be punished . : once [ wiki link : m : sul ] is implemented , this will no longer be an issue , but until then this is a valid concern . right now the best thing to do would be to create a userpage on the wikis where you parked the account ( perhaps with a soft redirect to your userpage ) then your account will be kept . : but i do n't remember any of those passwords ; i used throw - away passwords purposefully different from my en - wiki password ( for security reasons ) . i never intended to need to edit with them again ; parking indefinitely on that username is good enough . i ca n't help but think there are other people who 've done as i 've done and they 're going to be bitten by this days thing . : well using throwaway passwords means you will probably get all those accounts counted as conflicts when single login is imp li mented , with no way to associate them . so far as i can tell , sul will probably be imp li mented first , so by then you ( hopefully ) will have gotten a dev to reas sign the accounts for you . if using throwaway passwords is common , it would cause problems for both this , and [ wiki link : m : sul ] . about deleting blocked accounts . some editors have expressed reservations about deleting blocked accounts . i think that blocked accounts that meet the other criteria set forth above should be deleted . the concern is that deleting the account will leave the original creator free to recreate the account in an unblocked form . the vast majority of accounts that are blocked have been blocked precisely because of edits made under those accounts ; such accounts do not fall under this policy . the only way that an account gets blocked without ever having made any edits is if the username itself is highly offensive , an imposter , or uses a pattern of a known vandal , such as \" on wheels \" or \" is communism \" . the creators of such accounts are generally well aware that these accounts will be blocked immediately , and are not making long - term plans to use them . after days , the creator would likely have long forgotten that it had ever existed . if the creator would be inclined to recreate the same account ( surely only to be blocked again ) , this policy would not affect their ability to create an account with a nearly identical username , by having five exclamation points at the end instead of four , for example , or any number of other n once variations . thus , deleting these accounts offers no additional convenience to vandals whatsoever , as they can always create an account with a marginally different name . however , enacting this deletion policy will provide us with the great benefit of erasing many stupid and offensive usernames from the rolls of our user list . i therefore implore the community not to impose any limitation on the application of this policy based solely on the blocked status of an account to be deleted under it . cheers ! : actually , this strikes me as a good reason to keep blocked accounts : once we 've blocked \" on wheels \" , which we will do every time it 's created , we need never block it again ( and taking the effort to create it and failing may discourage the next vandal , which would be a [ wiki link : good thing ] . ) since an account with zero edits should be blocked only for inappropriate user name , this is , i think , the only question . : my point is , if we do n't delete these accounts , they stay in our database , and the vandal ( if inclined to make trouble ) simply takes the same amount of effort to make a slightly different offensive username . in short , if we do n't delete the account , we 'll end up having to block a different one , and will only increase the number of such perma blocked accounts in our database . besides , after days , hopefully that vandal will have found better things to do than bother wikipedia with offensive username registrations . however , i 'd be open to some compromise - suppose we agree to start with the oldest accounts first , as there are some never - used vandal accounts who have been blocked for years . knock out all unused blocked accounts that are more than a year old , and talk about proceeding with the rest after that is done . : i 'd be willing to simply add a note , commenting that there may be reasons to leave some blocked accounts , like and , in existence and perma blocked ; these may be as numerous as the indef - blocked attack accounts . : same rationale for deletion still applies . if vandalized and was blocked , the account can not be deleted ; if made an account but got blocked without ever having edited ( either because they never got the chance to make an edit or because they never intended to do so ) , i think it fairly safe to presume that days on , the creator of the account will have forge tten it ever existed , and will not go looking to re - create it in order to vandalize from it . furthermore , if the vandal does want to vandalize , he can just as easily create or . by leaving the account , we impose no extra work on vandals , but merely keep our list of users clogged up with nonsense . : i will add a note explaining that there is disagreement on this point . : i concur with ba on this . : to give an example of one of the two cases where i think it might be useful : is perma blocked as an impersonation account of . in this case , it was actually used ; but there are examples where such things were caught immediately . that should stay blocked . we do n't want anyone else picking it to impersonate the existing user ; and we do n't want some newbie picking it by accident . : that is food for thought - i can see a much stronger argument being made to keep blocked imposter accounts than to keep blocked or type accounts - are pretty much all imposters tagged as imposters , tho ? if they 're so tagged , i 'm sure we can set them aside for now and worry on them later . : not sure who ba is , but i agree with sep ten tri on alis ; deleting blocked imposter accounts just makes more work later . we 're not in a shortage of names currently , i see no need to go overboard . seems like it would be simple to make the bot software that is going to do these deletions skip over any account with a current block . : i presume he meant bd - anyway , my problem is that we have some really unpleasant and pointless \" attack \" usernames which would be great to get rid of ( and if they 've been around for more than days , it is probably harmless to destroy them ) . single login do n't know if this was mentioned before but would n't it be han di er to do this after single login is implemented ? many users on another wiki ( commons , foreign language etc ) made an account here to protect their name . and from what i 've heard single login does look now like it will be there in the foreseeable future . : wo n't such users want to trash all the individual accounts in exchange for a single login account then ? i concede , i 've made accounts on other wiki 's which i virtually never edit in order to protect this username . perhaps once this is implemented , we can have a notice posted on the other wikimedia projects for a short time to alert editors that old , unused wikipedia addresses are getting deleted , and the way to save them is to make an edit from them . : i assume there will be a way to join accounts . if so , then it would be better imo to wait till single login is implemented . it does n't seem that this proposal has to be implemented in a hurry anyway . it can wait ca n't it ? see also [ wiki link : meta : communications sub committees press pr sul this press draft ] . i saw referring to it recently . : well , i 'm not sure this proposal would affect anything for people who have cross - namespace usernames . either their old account will get booted for non use , or will get sucked into the new one . i presume that the single user account will not be deleted if there 's a single edit from it on any of the projects , but i also do n't want to hold my breath waiting for it to come about . my immediate concern is eliminating the unused offensive and insulting usernames created as a one - time gag . those should never be recast as single - user accounts either . : the only thing which could happen i think is that for instance the german equivalent ( famous admin name needed hmm ) tony sidaway has an empty account here , which he could lose if someone else registers it after the cleanup and makes a few minor edits on it . therefore making the account impossible to use for the german user . i have to admit that this scenario is not that likely to happen , but still . : there should be enough time so that he 'd be able to log into it for a certain amount of time , or make an edit to per serve the account . he came here to preserve his account by making it , i 'm sure he can come here to per serve it by logging in every so often or making an edit . : having a notice posted at every wiki project for a few weeks before we start deleting accounts should be enough to cover that concern ( although i 'd give obvious vandal attack accounts and inappropriate usernames no grace period ) . : all the obvious vandal and attack ac ounts of course can definitely be deleted . with all the other ones i still think it 's better to wait , just to be on the safe side . there 's no real hurry . : hm . how about if there was a way to check if the same username is registered on another project ? that way , we could immediately ( ) knock out the vandal attack accounts , and ( ) knock out unused no - edit accounts for which the name exists only on en . wikipedia ( which there must be a lot of , because my understanding is that en . wikipedia has orders of magnitude more accounts registered than any other wiki project ) . : it would be great if that 's possible . is there such a way ? : is n't there always ? i have great faith in the ability of technology to provide the solution ! : there 's [ external link : interiot 's single user login conflict checker ] but it 's pretty ( understandably ) slow . born h ji 'm thinking also about the scale of this undertaking . we 're talking here about deleting well over half a million never - used accounts - i doubt that can be done overnight . if we op ti mis tically say we 're going to delete , per day ( or one every seconds ) , it will take more than a month to knock out those that exist as of now . we must determine if we can set a priority order - the first thing to go should be any account that includes an obvious vulgarity or attack in the username , and once those are done we isolate those usernames that are unique to en . wikipedia and do knock them out in chronological order , deleting those longest unused first . perhaps we can introduce some other qualifiers like length of username or number of exclamation points ! ; - ) * well , we can always look at the [ external link : evil plans ] . [ wiki link : wikipedia : esperanza xd ] just a note : deleting usernames with or more edits . can not happen due to legal reasons . please read the [ wiki link : gfdl ] . sigh . : yes . that already was discussed here and on the project page though . : indeed , that is not what this proposal is about . implement ? this proposal has been voted on for days now , does anyone know when it is scheduled to end as there is virtually no opposition - with nearly a hundred and fi fe ty users voting in support and a mere opposing votes . just wondering .

well , we need references to define such , what common descent is . that is , lineages that people in a population have in common based on various criteria , both objective and subjective . such common descent manifests itself in other traits which may be related to it : societal , cultural , biological , behavioural , etc . \" how long \" is one of the boundaries such identification based on descent includes , but gene really refers to a common population group , not merely a times cale . you may not know the names of your great - grandparents alun , but alot of people do ( i disagree with you and would say most ) and there are various historical records for tracing descent as well as traditions , customs and family history passed down from your ancestors . other factors showing common descent : common alities in [ wiki link : physical appearance ] , memories of settlement and colonization , common [ wiki link : human behaviour behavioural ] traits which may or may not have genetic origins , but deemed as part of your ancestry . there is also other evidence for such , the most recent of such being population genetics ( early in development ) , which can state that the majority of an ethnic population are closer to each other in terms of markers of descent than other groups . the common descent however does not need to be measured in such a manner as in terms of how close they are to each other than to neighbouring populations . * can we cite a reliable source that claims that to be part of the \" fr ren ch ethnic group \" one has to have deep \" french ancestry \" ? what is this source ? where is there a definition of \" ethnic french \" that says this ? how does one \" prove \" deep ancestry in france ? * how old is the french ethnic group ? when did it start to emerge ? we know it did so in historical times . what were the groups that formed the french ethnic group ? there are groups that are now considered french that we know at one time were not considered part of the french ethnic group . for example the [ wiki link : oc ci tania oc ci tians ] were certainly not \" french \" in the thirteenth century , how and when did they become french ? should we include them as french . are bre tons ethnically french , what is their relationship to the french ethnic group ? if we want to identify people of the \" french blood \" then the people who belong to it are different depending on the period of history we are looking at . when we speak of excluding some people because they are not \" ethnically \" french , then how do we decide when and where \" anyone \" became \" ethnically french \" ? this appears to be an arbitrary distinction . many bre tons may not consider themselves \" ethnically \" french even today . on the other hand they certainly are french , that have french nationality and they live in a region of the world universally recognised as under the ju ri stic tion of the [ wiki link : france french ] [ wiki link : state ] . so how arbitrary do you want to be ? : many [ wiki link : bre tons ] would not classify themselves as french , even in terms of a nation ( see [ wiki link : breton nationalism ] ) and the same can be said about [ wiki link : basques ] , [ wiki link : cor si cans ] or any other ethnic minority in france , indigenous or foreign . if you want to gain a quick understanding of the ethnic \" picture \" among the indigenous peoples of france , this ethno linguistic map helps massively : [ external link : lan gu es de la france ] * the french people are a [ wiki link : nation ] , this can be thought of as a type of ethnic group . but nations have a much more culturally and socially heterogeneous membership than smaller ethnic groups . what is the difference between a nation and a smaller ethnic entity ? usually it has something to do with a defined geographical region , nations also have creation myths associated with them . the french nation is clearly of heterogeneous origin , groups were included that would certainly not previously have identified as \" the same blood \" . in the book \" language and nationalism in europe \" edited by stephen barb our it states in many , perhaps the vast majority , of modern nations there is likewise no evidence that in defending the nation one is defending one 's own genetic material ; the notion that the citizens of modern nations are kin s folk , while the citizens of ( potentially ) hostile neighbours are aliens , makes no sense in view of the highly varied genetic make - up of most modern populations . we can postulate that the need to belong to a community of some kind is a fundamental human characteristic , and that nations have arisen to fulfil this need , as earlier more primary communities - local , * tribal * , and religious - have lost their significance through economic and social change . \" he then goes on to cite anthony d . smith , giving his definition of a nation a named human population sharing an historic territory , common myths and historical memories , a mass , public culture , a common economy and common legal rights and duties for all members . nations , in the modern sense can only be relatively recent phenomena . finally on the distinction between nations and smaller ethnic identities ( ethnic groups if you will , though a nation can be seen as a type of ethnic group ) nations often de ve lo pe from ethnic groups . ethnic groups and nations often share names . the clearest difference is territorial ; both in earlier times , and in certain areas today where a nomadic economy prevails , ethnic groups can be scattered across vast territories , interspersed with other groups , and can practise a shifting lifestyle , occupying no clearly defined area . what is an ethnic group ? ethnic groups pre - date nations in the modern sense by millennia , a situation confused by the fact that the english word ' nation ' and it 's cognates in other languages are often used to refer to ethnic groups as well as to states and nations . unlike a nation , an ethnic group need not occupy a territory . also , unlike a nation , it 's ' common myths and historical memories ' may be much more plausible ; since ethnic groups may be much smaller than mo der nations , the often quite implausible myths of common descent that nations espouse ( and they may have been created or radically adapted by modern pro po gan dists ) can have much more credible equivalents in the case of ethnic groups . and , rather than ' mass , public culture ' uniting dis perate elements , there may be a high level of shared cultural norms ; and there is usually a shared language . so france is a nation . * according to your own cited material here , [ wiki link : ethnicity ] and [ wiki link : nation ] are dis in ct concepts which is clearly true in most cases . they often coincide ( especially amongst [ wiki link : eth non ation alism ] ) and at the same time often do not , as is the case in most countries nowadays who grant citizenship for example mainly via [ wiki link : jus sol i ] ( \" right of territory \" ) rather than ( or addition to , like [ wiki link : italy ] and [ wiki link : israel ] ) [ wiki link : jus san guin is ] ( \" right of blood \" ) . * if you want to claim that only people of french blood \" can be \" ethnically \" french then you need to do several things . find a [ wiki link : wp : rs reliable source ] that specifically claims this . ie a source that states what \" french blood \" is and that only people with it can claim to be part of the french nation ethnic group . * it is not simply about just french \" blood \" alun , and as i explained on the wikiproject : ethnic groups talk page , descent is more than just the biological aspects . find a source that claims that the \" french ethnic group \" is not a nation , or is different to the french nation ( not french state or french citizenship but nation ) . * no , there is no need to have any source that says they are \" not \" a nation since the concept of nation is distinct in many ways from that of ethnicity , as is mentioned in your own sources used above . all we need is sources regarding the french ethnic group , whether we create a new article or re - incorporate it into this one . make a realistic case that people with french citizenship who do not have \" french blood \" are excluded from the \" ethnic group \" or \" nation \" . * again there is no need for such and no one is mentioning french \" blood \" , only all the aspects associated with french descent . find a reliable source that clearly shows that french people all share a common ancestry with each other that they do no share with other ethnic groups . or failing this a reliable source that states that french people overwhelmingly believe that they share a common descent with each other that they do not share with other ethnic groups , of course you might have to exclude bre tons and basques , in which case these people would need to be excluded from the \" ethnic group \" article . * i 've already stated one source about the common elements or origins of the ethnic french population and there is no need for sources regarding how they are or are not related to other groups ( other europeans ) . all is needed is the information on the aspects that constitute french ethnicity , common descent and others . what are the rules governing membership of this group ? ethnic groups all have different concepts of membership descent kinship identity , there is no universal defining rule for membership of an ethnic group , rather these rules vary from group to group . shared descent does not have to have any basis in biological reality from the point of view of ethnic identity . what are the specific rules adopted by the french ethnic group or do any specifically french rules regarding descent exist ? we need a reliable source , preferably from an ethnographic study , that specifically states what rules govern concepts of shared descent and kinship in the french ethnic group . without these specific ethno logical observations it is hard to argue for the exclusion of people simply based on some vague idea that they are not \" indigenous ethnic french \" . the burden of proof is on the people who want to exclude these individuals as per [ wiki link : wikipedia : wikiproject ethnic groups ethnic groups and the burden of evidence wikiproject ethnic groups ] . * what entails the in cl usi veness and ex cl usi veness of the group will be dealt with in the referenced material that defines what the french ethnic group is . there may be no universal rule or standard ( though some disagree ) , but there is a definition amongst the ethnic french and from others when regarding them . those people that are not indigenous french being distinct is not vague whatsoever , especially when people like zi dane and curie are still identified strongly as berber and polish respectively , something indigenous ethnic french ( or french - french ) do not share . you are right though that the burden of proof is on those who want to create this article . reliable sources are needed and the aspect of common descent again most likely includes some sort of biological basis ( since descent i stel f is marked from a biological phenomena ) as well as other traits eg . cultural ) that can be associated with it . the image that the ogre produced is in use at the french wikipedia , ( [ wiki link : fr : pe up le fran ais ] ) and it appears that a picture of josephine baker has been in use on that page for some time . if these people are acceptable to the good people at the french wikipedia , then i find it really quite strange that there is a bone of contention here . might i suggest that they have a greater insight into this subject att he french wikipedia than editors here do ? if you can find reliable sources for all of this it still may not be convincing because there are bound to be sources that contradict these claims , and we need to include all points of view\n",

      "your arguments change from reply to reply . the arguments you gave to dpotop were not about weasel words but about potentially libellous material and using a widely read newspaper as ziua as source ( and if you anything against ziua 's reliability why do n't you remove also the other statements sourced by ziua and only this one ? ) . i simply directed you to the rules and to the habits of building biographies of romanian v ips . if you have something to counter argue to that , do it , otherwise why bother with straw men ? i see dpotop 's formula and i see nothing definitive in that . it 's a simple statement according to a source , which is how it should look like . anyway , do you care to give dpotop a threshold - after how long that information can be published here ? a day ? a week ? a month ? : again , the point was about how potentially libelous material is passed for reliable information , and about how conclusions and facts are intertwined . i do n't think that you have seen dpotop 's version , or at least not all of it ( check out his edits to the \" biography \" section ) . nor have you seen my version ( check out my edits to the \" controversy \" section ) . do so , and then we 'll talk some more . : on the first point i think i already argued . ziua is equally used for potentially libelous material because is a widely read newspaper . if new arguments opinions evidences are published , they can come on this page and enrich it . i 've seen dpotop 's version ( i 've checked the edits , it 's the same according to ziua . ) . and i 've seen your version ( removing completely his edit , not moving it to \" controversy \" section , not s wee tening some potential weasel words ) . you have a point the article is too fresh and it 's wise to wait for a reply , but that 's it . concede with dpotop on a several days break to see if anything pops up , but you ca n't simply reject this information just because tismaneanu denies it or you do n't trust ziua on tismaneanu . as we 're at it , g om a denies he 's an antisemite and that did n't stop first the fact , now the view to be here on wikipedia . : i repeat : have you seen [ external link : my version ] ? have you also per chance seen dpotop 's edit where the word \" de fe ction \" is placed in quotes , and where conclusions about the file ( such as \" prior to tismaneanu has been well integrated in the communist party structures \" ) are cited as facts present in the file ? have you ? and what about the current version , where some user has run amok with various pov claims ? have you seen it ? : no , i have n't checked the entire history , just the versions where you and dpotop changed the biography section repeatedly one after another . \" de fe ction \" sounds dubious , but that can be replaced with ' alleged de fe ction ' or wider phrases as the point of the new information is to show it was not actually a de fe ction . and as long as the edit starts with \" ziua published a new article \" i do n't see how the information becomes a fact . if you say \" according to ziua x \" or \" ziua published a new article stating x \" to me is the same . : placing the word in quotes was dpotop 's own initiative , and has nothing to with the file . in fact , the file clearly points out that it was a de fe ction , so no need for \" alleged \" or any such formulation . the edits in the biography section did not start with any relative statement , so you should perhaps read them again . let 's add to this that questionable material should never be equated with \" biographical info \" ( especially since dpotop 's edits rendered as certain in the first section what they later on claimed they were doubting ! ) . : true , not with the file , but there were allegations about his col ab or ations with communists after he left romania and i think this is what dpotop had in mind . anyway , placing quotes was ina propriate , i agree . : dpotop 's first edit in biography is \" according to his se cu ri tate 's file published by ziua \" - not the most cautious sentence in the world , but certainly not a fact . it is relative , it depends on two sources a ) ziua b ) the file . : as for the last thing , we 're in agreement again . the ' controversy ' section is suitable for such things until they 'll get unanimously admitted . : as for the last edits ( if you mean the earlier edits of vin tila bar bu ) , you have to agree they are not all harmful . there is tismaneanu 's activity in youth where he produced materials clearly supporting marxist - leninist ideology - you ca n't say if he really believed in them but they can be safely labelled as \" communist activity and publications \" , ziua published indeed a facsimile ( you can download the jpg image from the article 's link ) the authenticity can be questioned however , and the claims are indeed accusatory . i really do n't find useful mentioning a large list of how many communist elites sent their children to the school tismaneanu graduated so i wo n't comment on that . yes , there are weasel words but my point the added information is not entirely pov . i 'll work a bit on it , right away . : a discussion about [ wiki link : au ton om ist marxism ] , which is what the text refers to , is actually , in itself , not that much of marxism - leninism . what i can draw from the texts is that he was a marxist analyst required to present a conclusion ( not a body of text ) with a marxist - leninist color to it . the first part of this argument reflects a possible ideological choice ( * which is not the same as that of the regime ) , the latter does not ( if it would , almost every person who ever published something of substance in post - communist romania would have to be a \" leninist \" - given the idiotic messages censorship imposed on them ) . it is absurd to assume that a person using marxist rhetoric , imposed or cultivated , is necessarily a supporter of the regime ( from [ wiki link : sil vi u br uc an ] to [ wiki link : roy medvedev ] , the world is filled with c oun te rex am ples ) . from what i gathered from tism ne anu 's various interviews , he was having doubts about all forms of marxism at that time ( and had never supported official dogma ) . : but he 's not accused of having a communist belief , just of having communist activity . and i do n't think his published material is reduced to autonomous marxism . this is like saying v adi m 's activity before ' was simply poetry . his thesis about the new left and the frankfurt school allegedly ( i have n't read it ) concluded : \" the capitalism can not be anni hi lated by vague re ver ies , by dogmatic revolts , by sudden transitions and metaphysical studies . the only way to overrun this status - quo is the socialist revolution , where the pro let ariat under the leadership of the revolutionary political party will have the main role \" . this looks like mar xi sim - leninism to me and in some aspects even opposed to au ton om ism . also tismaneanu had a publishing activity in the papers of his time and even co authored to a book . i remember on article from jur n alu l national where the conclusions of tismaneanu report were par o died with tismaneanu 's materials published in co - au torship in an ed uc ative guide for the youth . you may know about them , if not i can search them for you . : i was specifically referring to the article in jur n alu l , actually . my point still stands : i believe that , from the fragments quoted , one can clearly discern a marxist ( not marxist - leninist ) perspective on au ton om ism . note for one the reference he made to communist romania having applied a , to paraphrase , more authentic au ton om ism - which , imo , is equivalent to the opinions of historians who were required to say something nice about x or y policy in order to get their volumes published ( and we could perhaps note , unlike jur n alu l , that this point was , in fact , very unlikely to be part of official dogmas ) . this is what i tried to point out about the very quotes ( several scholars expressed similar self - contradictory conclusions just so th sat the bulk of the work would be published ; i never supposed that tism ne anu 's books is au ton om ist in tone - just that it is a scholarly book about au ton om ism which had to pass ideological requirements ) . also consider that v adi m is not criticized for his views , but for his actions , and that he stood by his views after the revolution . tism ne anu 's actions are in no way relevant for \" communist activities \" , and there is no proof that , given the context , those are even his views . : that article on jur n alu l is built on excerpts from \" mic dic ion ar social - politic pen tru tin e ret \" a propaganda book . i have n't read it except those quotes , i am not sure if anyone here has read it , but the title seems obvious to point a propaganda book for the official ideology of those times . do you believe he supported in this book au ton om ist theses or other ideologies and not the ideology of his times ? certainly this is activity in the sense it was pictured ( and i support it here ) . as for your differences between brands of marxism , i suggest you to read the wikipedia 's article here : [ externa link : http : en . wikipedia . org wiki leninism ] . the emphasis on the role of party in the pro let arian revolution is actually a core tenet of the leninist doctrine and one of its main differences from ' classical ' marxism . that 's why the conclusion of tismaneanu 's thesis as it is formulated it advocates marxism - leninism as i claimed first time . also it seems he had a rich publishing activity in those years writing in many magazines and periodicals . true , i do n't know what exactly he wrote on , but again for a sociologist in those times what he could write ? criticism on communism ? let 's get serious ! : so we have a sociologist in ce aus escu 's era , with rich publishing activity , on whom we have quotes clearly supporting marxism - leninism , who co - authored in propaganda books , what do you want more ? : for now , let us note that ro wiki indicates that the book was never published ( it is an unsourced information , but it may turn out to render part of your point utterly irrelevant ) . : i beleive you have built yourself a straw man . let me state it again : i do not believe his book was au ton om ist , i believe it was about au ton om ism . i do not need a link to \" leninism \" , thank you very much , since my point was that the regime was leninist , making every little thing it touched leninist . the question about \" criticism of communism \" is a false dilemma : nobody could write criticism of communism , which does not make their writings pro - communist ; as yourself say , sociologists in particular could not avoid marxist - leninist rhetoric , which does not make them marxist - leninist ! my actual statements were regarding allegations about the purpose and form of his books , both of which are contended to be this and that , without definite proof . : the ziua file , if authentic , only says that he worked as lecturer at the propaganda commission of the municipal committee in parallel to his scientific work . this , in itself , does not even mean that he worked as a propagandist , but as a low - ranking cadre lecturing on certain topics ( at a time when all academic staff were required to be active on the party line ) . the weasel words about \" well integrated \" et al are not necessary conclusions of the text , and are based on the pov of some guys . furthermore , the document neatly separates the bulk of his academic contributions from his political attributes - and the latter are , under any definition , minor . : i agree . but i 'm supporting here only an admittance of his activity , not em ph ases . : again , if you actually check with the version i endorsed , you will see that his authorship of propaganda texts is mentioned ( i must insist , editors ' speculations that would include his scholarly works among propaganda does not belong on this page ; credited claims amounting to this are included and should remain confined to the last section ) . what i ask for is : * a source not to be cited for one conclusion while it is presented as controversial in another section of the same text ! ( therefore , references to his \" propaganda activities \" should be drawn from sources other than his alleged file , at least for now . ) : * all speculation about \" well integrated into party structures \" and other such crap to be dropped pronto , since it relies on weasel words and the qualifier is in no way a fact , but a comment [ an inaccurate and tendentious one ] of a fact ( if one wants to credit and attribute it , let him or her do so , and we 'll move it to the bottom section , where various opinions belong ! ) : as for br uc an , he 's openly admitted a communist in his wiki page , why the he si tations on tismaneanu ? : as i have said : br uc an was clearly a marxist - leninist . with tism ne anu , the proof appears to be far from sufficient , and facts used to draw that conclusion could just as easily not lead to it once you take jur n alu l 's theories out of the article . : the list of his colleagues resulted from the persistence of other users to add it . i think it may be somewhat relevant ( since he himself makes note of it ) , and may prove top be so if the article is to become more detailed ( such is the trend among featured articles ) . that said , i think that it will be alluded to again , so it may as well have a proper citation . i note that [ wiki link : lica ghe or ghi u ] was removed from the list , presumably on the notion that she is \" not notable \" ( although i think she was a horrible actress , she was still an actress in several films , and was also involved in several melo dramas of the nomen k lat ura ) . : you can add lica ghe or ghi u and whomever you want . i really do n't find it an important detail but at the moment the page is not that lengthy and can contain many details . : actually , the article 's length does not ever count in favor of content removal . a featured article is both long and detailed . the point you may want to make is about the info 's relevancy , and it is precisely because every article should aim to become a featured one that the info may be argued to belong ( similar biographical data is to be found in thousands of fas out there ) . : i 've seen lengthy article on whose talk pages it was debated whether if some less relevant info to be removed if not moved in other pages . again , i 'm not contesting your addition . : and about you and me as long as i 'm not replying to you or on you talk page , i do n't think i care about your interests but about those of the people i reply to or the interests of building correcting a page . but if you like to talk about yourself , i ca n't stop you , so you can remind me from time to time what your interests are or are not ( not that i would care\n",

      "censorship was final fantasy vii censored at all ? i mean , the content was n't as strong as , say , final fantasy viii 's , but i would imagine something was censored . plus , it does n't say anything about censorship on this page . could someone please answer to this ? not that i recall . it certainly was n't censored as much as the older games were . as i recall , some language was censored , some was n't . the word \" bastard \" appeared on various occasions , but \" fuck \" and \" shit \" were censored . < rec et in den t some words were censored , some were not , which ones seem arbitrary . only instance i could find of \" fuck \" uncensored : computer : cid ! we have an emergency situation ! a mechanic is still in the engine section of the rocket ! cid : what ! ? who is the little fuck ! ? computer : i do n't know . activating the inter com in the engine section . cid : hey go dd am mit ! who the * & 's still in there ? earliest instance of \" shit \" shin ra manager : i 'm not give in to violence . and i 'm not giving you my seat either ! tifa : barret ! barret : * ! you lucky * ! cloud : so , what are we gon na do now ? barret : shit ! the hell you so calm about ? you bus tin ' up my rhythm . in total , \" fuck \" is said uncensored once , \" shit \" is said uncensored times , \" ass \" is said times ( sometimes occuring as jackass ) , \" damn \" is said times , and i could n't find any occur ances of \" bastard \" . censored words appear approx . times . my version must be different . the \" fuck \" is censored , and the comment with barret the last editor quoted , the first word was uncensored ( though it had an apostrophe stuck in the middle , making it \" shi ' t \" . i noted a lot of uncensored \" ass \" and \" shit \" though , and after playing ff x and ff xii for so long , going back and playing ffvii , i was a little surprised by the language . in fact , it 's the only fantasy rpg i 've ever played with uncensored profanity . but yes , it was at least partially censored . nevertheless , unless we get concrete primary sourcing from an interview or whatever , we ca n't include this in the article . er well , the box says it 's rated teen for mild language and violence . but i 'm not sure of any primary sources that would even deal with this particular issue . beyond a mention that there is some uncensored language i really do n't think this type of info belongs in an encyclopedia . and even the slight mention is iffy to me . well , it 's the first final fantasy to come to america with any uncensored language . but then again , all the final fantasies to come to america in that period of time had to go through nintendo of america 's censorship guidelines of the time . it might be worth noting ( at least in the discussion ) that the computer version was far more censored than the ps x version . almost every instance of \" shit \" was removed , consistently with & or similar characters . also , certain important lines had their translations changed . \" back then , you could get by with only skinned knees \" , for example , was changed to something likely more grammatically correct , but weird to a long time player of the ps x version . i have the pc version of ff and i recall a ton of cid lines where there was censorship as well as ones form barret . they were all situations of anger though so it did n't impact the storyline much . actually there was some sexual censorship if i recall . \" slightly stretched underwear \" was changed to \" therapeutic underwear . \" not sure why it 's better , but i 'm pretty sure they did it because they thought \" slightly stretched \" was sexually inappropriate .

[ i spelling the acronyms for readers that are not used to the wikipedia jargon and who want to analyze what is happening in here . ] - : different points are view are always welcome but these points of view must allow for the article to become more balanced , npov . at the moment , the article is more negative than positive , in fact , which says we need more \" good stuff \" . : i am sure you will find a way to \" di gim on ized \" wikipedia . for example , the only \" good stuff \" about slavery is that some people were getting rich while others were dying and tortured and the children of their children , what was good about a di rec torship , what is good or positive about killing , what is good about prostitution and on . look i do not have time for educating you , but you have go and research , i am not telling you what to do but if you want to know something neutrally do you research but look for verifiable information . i personally do not have nothing against devry inc . but the institution that devry inc . has created for educating our youth and now adults . there is not good stuff coming for devry inc . it is dangerous for our nation , of course you live in england what do you care about it us . - : [ wiki link : godwin 's law ] you lose ! : let us this time mike godwin 's likelihood to be wrong and in this thread make it to approach zero , well what can you hope , to hear from you ? only the winning and losing mentality , go beyond than that , i do not think anybody is about losing or winning in here , just to have the power to do something greater than themselves , does is why you are dong it , right ? - : d'oh ! just so people do n't think vag ary is crazy , let the record show that all references to hitler were edited out . however , it occured past the invocation of [ wiki link : godwin 's law ] . nobody say all you contributors . it has been stated clearly in the subjunctive case , \" if \" , therefore if and only if you are contributor and it happens that you are a devry 's employee , then , seriously consider to go and work for somebody else . yes , i is co dep lowed stupid opinion but what am i writing this in here ? - : who are you to say that people who work for devry should work for someone else ? and why is it that \" [ wiki link : iff ] \" ? i do n't understand why only employees who are contributing to this article should consider working for somebody else . per [ wiki link : wp : coi ] , they are allowed to edit the article but should exercise great caution in doing so . : for the many ips adding content and by the same writing of some of them declaring that they were either employees , or students or both , by analyzing their writing and inputs and interactions on the web , perhaps you are one . regardless , some students and other people are busy in trying their money back that do no have time to come and write to you about it but eventually as the blogs increase they would come and help to portrait devry \" as is \" either good or bad , either more or less , \" as is \" for what i am very happy is you can yourself find verifiable information . : [ externa link : http : www . job ster . com at company devry university ] : it 's a bulletin board - type thing - which is not a reliable source because comments are non - attributable ( at least by wikipedia 's standards ) . see [ wiki link : wp : rs ] . : and quite frankly , i do not understand why you are accusing me of favouring devry . i saw a legitimate request at one of the village pumps , i took offence to your comments on \" wiki impostor \" and what i deemed harassment , so i took out the paragraphs ( which were duplicated anyway ) . i then [ external link : cleaned up the article ] as is my usual job on wikipedia . then : * [ external link : some information was removed about a lawsuit - i said it would be a lot better to say there was a suit but it was dismissed , with a source , although its correctness was n't fully established . still , a source can be found . ] : * [ external link : you then put some information in the lead section , which i took out , removed the original research and put into another section because it was becoming apparent controversy was a part of this university . ] [ external link : you then put the information back without removing it from the new section i made ] and [ external link : i removed it ] . i did not feel like that version was advertising at all - it did not promote anything about the university at all . the sheer lack of description of the university itself compared with the criticism , in fact , made the tag wholly inappropriate ! : > it is not better lawsuits and class actions are different , secondly , i called those who were identify as wiki impostors because the were vandalizing the entry and other entries , like the one from scientology from a range of ip address located in one devry campus as the archive or , now i do n't know even where it is but we can find it , shows , you probably erased something without contemplation and then you were caught and put as wiki impostor , but this was solved as you were for some reason not anon and start to show up . other user even amended his her ways declare the self as devry 's employee and student and ask for help , reasonable , then went of and change almost everything without any concern for yours , mine or anybody 's contribution , now that is vandalizing , since that events you have been also changing things as you please and many things have been accepted by my and others . vag ary is happy about your contribs . and you are happy about vag ary , you probably are one and the same but who cares . - : * [ external link : you then changed a source ] .

: i welcome devry employees or pr people to work on the article with us to provide a balanced account of the article . they can help find sources on the university itself and clarify information we might not know , by directing us to information . there is nothing wrong with that . : i am not jimbo , to welcome anybody in here but if you come and want to add lies or hide lies and present false information , i do n't care if you are henry viii , or devry 's president , i wo n't take it , and you also should n't , you see in wikipedia there are not interest of who you are or where you came from , the interest could be self - promotion , nothing wrong with that when you are an artist and yes why not you have something to let people know about you , other thing when you are talking about institutions that want to use wikipedia as google links , and that capture they called recruit , i have a better word , trap students , now even they want to do it online . therefore , if an employee comes add something that is plausible , alright but as you see many come to add advertising and nonsense , comparing it courses in b ps with real engineering course that is misleading by the naked eye . we need to establish the difference , to the reader , and also present all the facets of this or any organization currently in business , why not ? then , after the information is available then the reader could make a clear decision about it . let us work on that with devry employees , and those who are not also . content . : there has been a couple of occasions where some stuff has been removed and i reverted it - but there was one occasion where it was unsourced content - which is fine to remove . : i strongly suggest you stop accusing people of sockpuppetry and strongly suggest you drop your vendetta against people who appear to be devry employees . they have every right to edit the article as you do although they have the additional burden of [ wiki link : wp : coi ] . so far , there has been little resistance to criticism removal which is a good thing . : sockpuppetry is a bad thing you need to return my entries honor the dicussion . : [ wiki link : wp : sock legitimate uses of multiple accounts ] . and i know a sysop who has multiple accounts for security reasons , but only one has sysop abilities . : there is , however , resistance by you to keep soapboxing comments on this talk page - even you admit it is soapboxing . it is not permitted and it is not vandalism to remove what is not warranted . just as devry university employees are allowed to remove unsourced accusations . : i never admitted doing that , i wrote that is it not a good idea , i explain to you that we need to show resistance to exp lo iters and vandals . antagonizing that behavior is not soapboxing is protecting the content and confront those who are not helping in th process of \" neu tr alizing \" which i explain in this case is presenting the facts . the documentation has , i you have seen , started to talk and is talking . why because people are reading us . that why some users wanted to archive and archive this page , they do not want us to discuss their behavior . accuser that are accusing of the violation that they themselves commit that is one of the tactic that thy use to brain wash and alienate people , student and not the reader of wikipedia , nope , i do n't think so you believe this but when the time comes you wo n't allow it . for that i am already sure . : of course i resist vandalism . but not all edits to this page are vandalism , although you may see it differently . i see content dispute - you see censorship . : as for this thought of yours suggesting that blogs will eventually \" expose \" devry , very well , let them do it . i 'm not bothered . these blogs ca n't be linked to wikipedia anyway as it is not attributable nor are they reliable . if a reputable newspaper does a report on the university , then it can be linked ( and i would like it to , irregardless of whether it is praising the university or otherwise ) . : correct but bear in mind that they did already and entry in this regard not too long in tv , blogs are good way to measure information at first hand . but for now newspapers , be careful devry pay advertising and there articles that just are advertising and also in tv , i am talking the press reporting class action against devry inc . there many and there are of interest , why because they have been filed by students and parents . - : if a newspaper a is a reliable source , it should not run paid articles . those are fine . section break ( in case editors run into edit conflicts editing the whole section ) devry inc . is not anymore a case , it is issue and it is not a joke . devry university is mat uring in what finally is , and ag onizing mal ady for our education system in the united states and there a lot of official reports and people who actually do not have the voice or the means to v enti late this more conspicuously to the public and more importantly to the press . - : and is wikipedia morally bound to expose how bad a university it is ? yes , it is subject to a lot of criticism , partially because of the nature of this business , but take a look at what i found [ external link : here ] : as one of the largest degree - granting higher education systems in north america , devry university provides high - quality , career - oriented associate , bachelor 's and master 's degree programs in technology , business and management . approximately , students are enrolled at its locations that are in states and canada , as well as through devry university online . devry university , a division of devry inc . ( ny se : dv ) , is based in oak brook terrace , ill . for more information about devry university , visit [ externa link : http : www . devry . edu ] . : do it , accept your responsibility , cross it out , that is ad ver ting in here is like ' blasphemy - : putting a link in here is not advertising because i am using it to illustrate a point . i could argue that writing \" devry \" is advertising . it is not . : this university can not be as bad as you think it is . it has good points . it offers a service to the community . it has bad points . all of this can be mentioned in the article . : if you wish to vent out your bad points about the university , you should consider a different medium of approach other than wikipedia . consider public awareness campaigns , protests , or even blogs - but a neutral site is hardly going to be the best approach . : i would not that the cited document is a devry press release and thus a very poor example of \" someone saying good stuff about dev rey . \" your general point is valid ; you just picked a poor example . ) : again ! please x bn , i am im pl oring you and k ne eling begging for you to come into the few senses that you still have by now , do not take out that link dev ry whatever but cross that out ! come on ! you can do it , you can do it ! you have the guts , or it is that you really do not ? it happens that you can not rv yourself ? is that the case then you have to go to [ wiki link : wikimania ] i am not wiki doctor so you have to remove your \" dues \" . - : what do you have against a link that is on the article already ? i am using the link to justify a point . why not argue i am advertising bio health matics . com ? or if i put a google search up , why not argue i am advertising google ? i am not advertising devry . co dep lowed - : o yes is bad as being in hell , i will post many descriptions in here but really i would like you to find it for yourself , i am sure is pretty scary . what this people is doing . well again , showing what devry inc . has to say about devry is an advertising and rather very poor judgment , it is not what you say , or they say or i say , it is about documented and verifiable information , you should cross out , do not delete it this entry , so you remember how wrong you were and how dis respectfully you behavior was when writing about and responding to co dep lowed . who is taking time for illuminating you , now the mantra is simple , wikipedia is morally bound because pretends to embrace all knowledge , so the deep question , is epi ste mo logical in nature , what kind the knowledge we want in here ? fictional example : for example , suppose we were living in time of mussolini , and i am opposed to the and his racist and fascist ideas , then i write about my position on them , that his is not good and need to go out of power and bla , bla ; then you would tell me that we can get not even close to him because he is in power , he is doing good things , like giving people work , and you go and argue this is not the place to talk about mussolini , please do not do it , and i evenly write and say mussolini is really bad and evenly more finally i signed it . you got mad , now you talk to some fascists , they do look like normal for you , well because you are young and they have the power and you do not better or they do things that you like , or just because , you do n't believe in what i am writing . with this attitude you got get and accuse me and vandalize my writings and they finally kill and finally the fascist will take the power and the world would end to be . what ? cp - : of course you may argue , you are comparing mussolini or slavery with devry , nope i do n't , i compared the freedom of giving you my ideas to find solutions , to gain neutrality in how we depict any entry that is \" alive \" . hitler , we know what we know about the whole thing but still there are people around there that , for instance , are saying that the holocaust never happen , and now there are many people that believe in that crap and have an international convention on this mere topic , do yo believe this ? if these filmed and well documented events are not too easy to understand fast to mas quer ade , how you without knowing very well and living out of this country or doing a serious m edi tative inquiry , can say \" it never happens \" or devry is not \" too bad \" . look , now that is beyond me . and all for the sake of \" your \" adding \" good stuff \" because it [ the entry ] needs to be balanced out , what is this line of thought ? so it look nice for some fascists or people of other kind alike ? readers read wikipedia because they know the can edit it when they see something that is not valid . are you want to input fictitious cases just you think is a good idea to em bel lish an entry with \" good stuff \" ? i you do then you are aiding causes that do not have nothing to do with the aims of the wikipedia . \" re compiled all this deep in your soul . \" : well all the same , you claim this you claim that , x bn and other ip address and names , you did n't do your homework in this subject , that is all , do it now , so it takes time but if your really adamant abut devry 's goodness then by all means , find accountable information . i am looking for it several and long years too and i ca n't find conclusively any of it . here , \" neutral \" in an entry does n't mean good or bad , or positive or negative goes beyond this . an entry is and entry \" as is \" described by reputable sources , and that sources needs to be interpreted with neutrality too . ok so research , and learn it is a good subject , \" devry inc . history and its idiosyncratic business practices \" and do n't write down to people you do n't know - of course wikipedia is not a soapbox and it is bad idea to attack anything in here , agree with you , but also is not the pan acea of marketers and sales representative or ant edi lu vians executives who do not care for what education means for america more precisely at this g lo b alized and singular historical time - space . what they do care is about the dollars that these business represent for their pockets . what are creating a lot of problems and in part if why are job are going to china and india nowadays , we do not have well trained people fast enough for our needs . devry 's model is not an answer is one of the problem . they are not in the business of education , the are in the business of students loans . these executive , and you know it , are accountable to the people of this country , and devry inc , or devry university should be accountable and face the scrutiny of the respective authorities , the different publics and the press . - : that 's your opinion , and i respect that , but that should not come into the article at all . not unless you publish that work with a reliable source and yourself are a notable writer . : thank you for respecting my opinion , but this is a discussion talk page , and if i write this in here because the behavior exhibit in the edition of this entry , and for making sure that we gain \" neutrality \" anyway , i feel much better , probably one day you will read what i wrote , but it is not my interest to be in here for personal gain , as you might see , also i have not personal vendetta , there are other issues i am working at the moment , this one is very important but i would leave this conversation very soon , as i see the information in this entry in better shape that was before my intervention but it needs much work with still with more verifiable information . i will comeback for time to verify the approximation of it . - : up there you said you were speaking to the press , reporting class action against devry inc . that sounds like vendetta to me . i do n't think that employees or these executives from devry are not welcomed in wikipedia , i do n't know , but what is reprehensible is that some contributors are erasing important sources for one reason or other . now , we are watching this with our own eyes , and do nothing about it , what kind of wikipedians really are , forget co dep lowed and remember the spirit of collaboration in you , is this insulting ? i do n't think so . it is ought to be stated in here because the way things are happening , again you are not like what you read write something , perhaps i will answer it but definitely i will defend your right to post in this page , about this subject or the way to write this subject and way we need to emphasize in good or bad points about this for me monkey and harming devry business . - : yes , there are users who are doing questionable things but they are not the only ones . but as i have said before , stuff that is removed without question , whether negative , positive or neutral , tends to be reverted . unsourced material that can give legal problems can be removed immediately . : yes as you did , you deleted all my essay just because you wanted to do that or you think that was right to do it , but as you see i wrote a new one more for you and others . - : which is still soapboxing but i have to get it into your mind that it is bad for wikipedia . : what you have to get into your mind that your are \" stealing \" from others and taking decisions that are not yours to take , you are acting as the sole owner of this page , just what your are doing has a name : it is called di gim onizing the discussion . now bear in mind this is not a chat in which the electronic text or content belong to the company that host the forum or blog . be careful , i will give som ed ays to put back what you have took and please take out that ridicule press released from here , honor your \" job \" , or you want to insult with it , your got it . remember you have been warned for the last time and just want you to be \" you \" but do not impose your view in other , discuss in fine , deleting and throwing stones and hide your hands in wrong , well a least you are throwing stones without hiding your hands , uhm . sometimes any way that is vandalizing . - : per [ wiki link : wp : npa removal of text ] , there is no policy regarding removal of personal attacks so i take the essay 's view and opted to remove it . either way , it was posted many times hence i treated it as harassment as well . : a [ wiki link : digimon ( creature ) digimon ] is a fictional creature - you can not \" di gim on ise \" a discussion . it 's not possible . i 'm not going to put it back because i believe it should stay out . i have been warned for the last time , true , but without the previous few warnings and a sysop does not necessarily ban or block just because there is a level warning . and i am not going to hide that warning . my conduct should be able to speak for itself regarding that level warning and i doubt i will be blocked for it . and what you are saying there constitutes harassment as well . i suggest you redact those comments . section break now . if and only if you work for devry and you are trying to edit in here , and this is kind of thoughts are offensive for you , please show us proof and evidence for your side on the controversies , and do not try to mitigate or denied the substantiation on devry 's history archives . do not come to wikipedia to advertise or accusing of vandalism while you are doing it is imposing your views by erasing official public information , because , what would happen at the end of the day and throughout many mor nings is that , the headers and banners will be reaching in ex ten sible and multiplying blogs [ exactly like a virus ] and the newspapers , as hungry as they really are for scandals , about : \" devry inc . executives are vandalizing wikipedia \" read inside : trying to hide and cover - up their misdeeds and deceptive and historical business practices devry executives are bu lling and threaten wikipedians that an tag on ized their views in what is the most open an neutral encyclopedia ever create by the humankind , devry is using different tactics to silence well intentioned editors , who are presenting evidence and seem to be tire of its propaganda , well we did a especial report this is \" min inu tes \" and continue . it seem that this same devry inc . 's tactics are know in the blog sphere as . will continue soon - : assume good faith ! do not assume that the people who are removing criticism are devry employees . they could be graduates who have enjoyed studying at devry university . they could be mindless vandals or clueless newbies . they could be newbies testing out things . they could be people who misinterpret npov as only neutral views being allowed . and they are not threatening other members - if they are , you can go to [ wiki link : wp : an i ] with [ wiki link : wp : diff diffs ] of evidence and the sysops will deal with it . if these people are devry employees , you are threatening them by saying it could go onto minutes or various blogs exposing it - and this is harassment . which is why after you make a new edit to this page i am removing this paragraph . : i assumed good faith and have good faith , i have good will , do you think i would write in this way if i were not have good will . think , look and do . do not remove paragraphs because , even if you do , it does not mean that actually that is not happening , people are in the process as other organizations but it takes time , do your research , as i told you , the law is the law , it takes time but in one way or other comes . respect entries , honor the readers , honor history , and remember , i never have move your comments out of this page , because this page belong to all of whom want or will want to contribute to devry university as an entry to be read in an universal encyclopedia page . - : a talk page is not meant to hold information about an article - it is to discuss the article itself . when it comes to harassment , there is no compromise . editing is meant to be a conducive environment and harassment does not help that . : you have your own definition of harassment and talk page , it seems that it has not seen to have been well supported only other that by yourself and two , probably socket - puppets \" evil - do ers \" that are vandalizing this entry page for suspicious reasons . hur ray ! they are very happy because you are acting as their defender now they do not have to deal with me at all . read this well everybody is welcomed as far i concern as a person , as a mind no matter how they look like , or what they do believe , or work with as long they are not exploiting or harming the contents or wikipedia at large , and please , i am not stating that anyone in her want to do that , as far as i know . however , when your views are not supported and shared by others that are out of the discussions and supposed to be in another lever than you , what you do or did , eh ?

[ ] : thanks ! i will definitely look into all of that . i did n't realize that getting an article featured was such a ritual , although i should have expected as much . i do n't generally look at the featured articles , but looked at today 's on the [ wiki link : philadelphia inquirer ] . no doubt it 's im politic to say so , but i was pretty under wh el med . ungrammatical sentences , at least one misspelling , whole paragraphs making assorted factual assertions without a single reference , etc . : yeah i am just mentioning it , since i had a rather bad experience with [ wiki link : bu ghouse chess ] . for the article i read several books , spend weeks researching and contacted a dozen of people for info . in my obviously biased opinion it is the most balanced and complete essay ever written on bu ghouse . nevertheless , it was c ri ti zed for its length and for the lack of history section . although it is hardly my fault the history is unknown ! what matters for fa more is ( ) the topic ; ( ) the length of the article and perhaps the most important one ( ) whether it looks good ! shorter articles , with less text are read far more thoroughly than long articles , and therefore far more prone to critic . i have also seen many long fa articles riddled with mistakes . that said , do n't let my bad experience discourage you . the first step is of course getting this article through a and ga review . i think it needs a little bit more work , but not much . : [ wiki link : bu ghouse chess ] indeed looks like a very thorough article , and i 'm sorry you did n't make it . but i appreciate learning of your unhappy experience : that way i wo n't take it too hard when [ wiki link : swindle ( chess ) ] gets shot down . comments this is clearly a very good article on a difficult and under studied subject . apart from voor land t 's comments , here are some additional remarks if we want to narrow the gap to fa - class : * the article includes [ wiki link : wp : or original analysis ] , and that is forbidden in wikipedia ! see for example th reference . * in the lead , i do not understand the difference between the first sentence \" in chess , a swindle is a ruse by which a player [ . ] achieves a win or draw instead of the expected loss \" and the second sentence \" it may also refer more generally to obtaining a win or draw from a clearly losing position \" . probably the first sentence refers to one - mover and the second is more general , but this could be more explicit . * as the lead states that certain players [ . ] have become famous for their s wind ling exploits , i would expect to see a section in the article on famous s wind lers ( with due references , of course ) , otherwise it is just reckoning . * some diagrams have a legend that is too long . i would expect the legends to be no more than one line . * i would suggest to systematically include in the legend of the diagrams the move number at which is position is obtained . * most sections in recurrent themes are just a collection of examples . would it be possible to add a bit more substance ( i mean , some general considerations in each chapter ) to make it a bit more \" encyclopedic \" ? * in the section perpetual check there are interesting remarks about the pieces that are good for attack but suddenly bad for defence , making it impossible to the player to adapt to the new situation . maybe these considerations could be generalised , develop ped and put into the section practical consideration as they are not valid only for perpetual check . * the section practical consideration is the most encyclopedic one . in order to promote it , i would propose to put it before the section recurrent themes , and to split it into different subsections ( for the moment it is too long ) . * there seems to be some syntax problems here and there ( although i am a pure pat zer in syntax ) , just to name a few : * the first sentence of the section classic example lacks an ending point . * same section , the second sentence has a reference placed in the middle of the text , which is not in line with the formating guidelines , as far as i know . * same section , sentence but marshall saw an opportunity for \" a last ' swindle \" , there seems to be a lonesome comma in the quotation . * in \" de fir mian - shi ra zi \" , in the sentence \" since . q xe allows . r fl . \" there is a \" l \" instead of a \" . * the sentence \" draw by perpetual check is another oft - seen way of s wind ling \" when the word \" often \" is misspelled . * the sentence \" however , k ro gi us warns that one should deliberately get into time trouble only after a detailed assessment of a number of considerations \" contains twice the word \" after \" . * there is no history section ; that could be useful to know if there are more or less s wind les than in the past , e . g . due to the improvement of chess computers . * there is no example with a chess computer , whereas i believe they are very good in s wind les due to their great tactical abilities . * the consequences of famous s wind les could be explained further , e . g . for \" the swindle of the century \" . * in the stalemate section , a sentence says \" another famous marshall swindle is marshall - m acc lure , new york ( diagram at right ) \" while i understand it should be \" ( diagram at left ) \" . * in the weak back rank section , the first sentence says \" mating threats along the opponent 's back rank often enable one to win or draw from a lost position . \" which is precisely the definition of s wind les , if i understand correctly . therefore a more con si se formulation could be something like \" mating threats along the opponent 's back rank often enable one to swindle . \" * having the diagrams first and the explanations next could be found a bit confusing for the casual reader , especially as there is no clear separation between the different articles . maybe sometimes some subsections could be used ? * in the example \" chi gor in - sch le chter , ost end \" , i find there are too many exclamation marks in the explanations , as i would only give an exclamation mark to . qc , the other ones being nor difficult to find , nor forced . * i do not see the point of putting wikilinks for years , like [ wiki link : ] , especially when the sentence has nothing special to do with the concerned year . * the article contains some id . references that do nothing apart from taking space , while it is better in wikipedia to cite several times the same reference without creating a separate line every time . * in the first sentence about \" de fir mian - shi ra zi \" , we can read \" gm de fir mian is ahead three pa wns \" while i am not sure it has been explained above that \" gm \" stands for grandmaster ? same remark for \" im shi ra zi \" . * the difference between a swindle and a blunder is not clearly explained . i mean , do you have a swindle every time there is a trick in the position ? or is it only when you play second - best move that sets up a trap ? * i am not sure the \" zuk er tort - stein itz , london \" example is a good one , as i do not see the swindle . i mean , black has sacrificed an exchange to de centralised the white queen and get an attack , then the attack succeeds because white blunders . but where is the ruse ? * same remark on \" donner - fischer \" : is it really a swindle ? it looks like just a blunder from fischer . * same remark on most of the examples in the material in su f fic i ency section : not really s wind les to me , just good play from the side with the less material . this is ac know le d ge g in the article , but then why keep them here ? a good example of swindle could be the recent game \" gri sch uck - pol gar \" when pol gar managed to save a k n p k n end game . * very generally , in a fa review there could be some critics regarding the need for an article on the subject , for example : * what is the need for an article on \" s wind ling in chess \" ? i mean , there could just be an article called \" swindle ( games ) \" ? is there any way s wind les in chess are particular , e . g . compared with s wind les in [ wiki link : go ( board game ) go ] or [ wiki link : english draughts checkers ] ? * why is theme encyclopedic , and not just trivia ? given the references , it seems noone has bothered to publish some work dedicated to this subject , so maybe this is just a collection of anecdotes ? * why is theme encyclopedic , and not just a definition ? why not just moving the definition to wik tion nary , instead of an article in wikipedia ? i hope you do n't find these comments too harsh or pointy , of course the aim is just to improve the article and maybe prepare a fa review , which are often very depressing . close the review as the nominator has withdrawn the nomination for the article , i shall close the review\n",

they are infinitely more valid than yours for they are surveys of actual atheists . since you do n't have any evidence written by atheists that claims atheism is \" belief of lack , \" we are left only with the writings of atheists ; all of which so far have said that atheism is \" lack of belief . \" : just one . that 's all i 'm asking of you . a single reference written by atheists that says the primary definition of atheism is \" belief of lack \" and not \" lack of belief . \" : re : \" are you claiming that ' active , conscious , outspoken non believers have the right of self - definition ' or are you claiming that ' people with a lack of belief have a right of self - definition ' , \" : neither , and that is why we keep going around the merry - go - round . once again , you have the arrow of implication backwards . you keep trying to start with the definition of \" lack of belief \" and then try to find some label that will apply to it . : what i am claiming is that the community of atheists has the right of self - definition . if the community of atheists says that they lack belief , then that is what atheism is , primarily . : re : \" good point . and you are including this group of people under the descriptor ' those with a lack of belief in god ' . \" incorrect . you are . i have been telling you over and over again that you 're going about it backwards . all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares . there are lots of ways to lack belief , but not all of them are atheism . : but , we are not trying to define \" lack of belief . \" we are trying to define atheism ! therefore , who cares about the myriad ways one can lack belief ?

the common characteristic shared by the overwhelming majority of atheists is not sufficient to characterize atheists ? : re : \" people with no thoughts on the matter do not claim the title of atheist . \" : that 's because they 're not atheists ! we 've been through this already . \" implicit atheism \" is nothing more than philosophical self - justification , amounting to no more than coming up with a label for the trivial case . infants are n't atheists . animals are n't atheists . inanimate objects are n't atheists . theoretical people who have grown up on a desert island with absolutely no contact with any other human are n't atheists . they have not carried out the philosophical activity required to come to a conclusion that the concept of god is invalid either because they are unaware of the concept of god , incapable of engaging in philosophical activity , or have no mind to speak of . : none of that is atheism . : re : \" my primary point is that , if the definition is ' lack of belief ' there is no practical way to ask that group \" : but we already have ! we asked the atheists , they said it was \" lack of belief , \" so where do you get off saying that we ca n't ask the group ? : wait a minute . you 're back on this kick of starting with \" lack of belief \" and then demanding that i prove everybody who has a \" lack of belief \" would definitively claim , \" i am an atheist , \" are n't you ? how many times do i have to spell it out for you before you remember it ? : we are n't looking for a definition of \" lack of belief . \" we are looking for a definition of atheism ! do you truly not understand this ? if you were looking for a definition of atheism , who on earth would you ask if not atheists ? : i keep bringing this up , but you keep seeming to miss the point : all squares are rectangles but not all rectangles are squares . let me see if i can clarify it . a square has all the properties of a rectangle . all rectangles are qu adri later als and all squares are , too . all rectangles are e qu i angular and all squares are , too . all rectangles have two sets of parallel sides and all squares do , too . : but squares have properties that can not be generalized to all rectangles . a square 's two di ag on als are equal , but not all rectangles have that property . the length of all sides of a square equal , but not all rectangles have that property . thus , while it is true that a square is a rectangle , it is not necessarily true that a rectangle is a square . : and thus it is with the relationship between atheism and lack of belief . atheists have the properties of those who lack belief , but in addition they also have properties that not all those who lack belief do . if left to their own devices , those who lack belief will display no activities regarding a relationship with god . this is the same with atheists : if left to their own devices , they do not go around proclaiming their lack of belief . unless you specifically introduce the concept of god , you 'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between one who merely lacks belief and one who is an atheist . : but it 's that introduction of the concept of god that does it : one who merely lacks belief will look at you qui zz ically when you say the word \" god . \" they do n't understand what you 're talking about . an atheist , however , will simply tell you that god does n't exist . : squares are rectangles , but not all rectangles are squares . : atheists lack belief , but not all who lack belief are atheists . : that you keep insisting that i prove that all who lack belief are atheists shows you truly do not understand what the point of an article named \" atheism \" is . we are looking for a definition of \" atheism , \" not a definition of \" lack of belief . \" : re : \" what you 're saying ( if i understand you correctly ) is that . atheists have a right to self - definition . i then say , . okay , then how do atheists define themselves ? you ask the group who use the label and they say , . atheism means lack of belief . i then say , okay , well if atheists are people with a lack of belief , and they have a right to self - definition , then . ask people with a lack of belief ( atheists ) how they define themselves . \" : stop right there . you just tried to reverse the arrow . step is invalid . notice how you have e qu i voc ated \" atheism \" with \" lack of belief . \" notice how you have tried to take the group of \" atheists \" and turn them into the group of \" those who lack belief . \" you can not do this . : all squares are rectangles . not all rectangles are squares . : ) squares have a definition . : ) okay , what is that definition ? : ) it is being a special kind of rectangle . : ) so let 's define rectangles ( which are all squares ) . : do you see the error there in step ? all squares are rectangles . not all rectangles are squares . it is logically invalid to go from square to rectangle and then expect to be able to return back to square . atheists lack belief . not all who lack belief are atheists . it is logically invalid to go from atheists to those who lack belief and then expect to be able to return back to atheists . : atheists are a special kind of people who lack belief . : re : \" you are unable to do this . \" : because i do n't have to . it is irrelevant . we 're not talking about the group of people who lack belief . we are talking about atheists . ' the name of the article is \" atheism , \" not \" lack of belief . \" : re : \" the only people you are asking are people who have thought about the question and have rejected theism . \" : precisely . they 're the only atheists around . merely lacking belief is not enough to be called \" atheism . \" \" implicit atheism \" is nothing but a triviality . : re : \" well , if atheism is lack of belief , then i think we are talking about all people who lack belief . \" : yes , but not the entire group of people who lack belief . all squares are rectangles , but not all rectangles are squares . : re : \" f fr f is based on the idea of keeping religion out of government . they oppose religion in government . \" : how does that make them \" anti - religion \" or \" anti - theist \" ? are you saying that the constitution is \" anti - religion \" ? after all , the constitution makes it explicitly clear that no religious test shall ever be required for public office . how is that \" anti - religion \" or \" anti - theist \" ? : re : \" infidels . org 's slogan is ' culture jamming theistic memes since ' . they are obviously anti - theistic . \" ( * chuckle * ) you really have n't read their site , have you ? does the term [ wiki link : sarcasm ] mean anything to you ? what about [ wiki link : satire ] ? [ wiki link : hyperbole ] ? : oh , and if arguing against the existence of god is \" anti - theism , \" then all religion is by definition \" anti - atheism . \" this makes the term meaningless . you are converting a difference of opinion into bigotry . : i 'm still waiting for your reference . just one . that 's all i am asking for . just one reference written by atheists that says atheism is \" belief of lack \" rather than \" lack of belief . \" since you do n't have any , how can you possibly refuse to accept the references i have provided that were written by atheists who claim it is \" lack of belief\n",

      "i dedicate all my pen e trations about this legendary circuit that i will expose in this discussion to my love er ato that in spi res me to continue revealing the secrets of electronic circuits . the simple but complex wilson current mirror . maybe , there is no so simple ( containing only three transistors ) and , at the same time , so incomprehensible and misunderstood circuit as wilson current mirror . there are many [ wiki link : resources resources ] that have tried to explain without success this sophisticated , ingenious and elegant circuit solution by using formal methods . but they do not give us what we need , first and foremost , as human beings - the basic idea ( s ) behind this odd , strange and exotic circuit . it is a great paradox to calculate circuit without knowing the basic idea behind it ! ? ! so , before showing in detail how to calculate the electronic circuit in this wikipedia page we have first to show what the very basic idea is behind the circuit . questions to be answered . looking at the circuit diagram , we need to answer dozens of questions that are never answered . what does the transistor q do in this circuit ? what is its function there ? why this current mirror contains another simpler current mirror q and q ( why an additional simple current mirror is nested in the main current mirror ) ? ! what is its function ? but why this simple current mirror is reversed ( why the transistors q and q are swapped ) ? why the q 's collector current serves as an input quantity and the q 's collector current as an output one ( we thought the q 's collector current was the input quantity and the q 's collector current was the output quantity ) ? are there negative feed backs in wilson current mirror ? if there are , what are they ? how many negative feed backs there are ? what are their functions ( why they are included ) ? what and how do they control - voltage or current ? what are the advantages of wilson current mirror versus current mirror with emitter degeneration ? how does wilson current mirror keep up an almost constant current ( why it has an almost infinite output resistance ) ? why the input and output currents are almost equal ( what is the trick ) ? has a mos fet wilson current mirror any advantage versus the simple mos fet current mirror ? he uri stic approach . since there are no satisfactory answers to the questions above , let 's try to disclose the mystery of the famous circuit by ourselves ; let 's answer these questions relying mainly on our human intuition , imagination and common sense . the best way of understanding and presenting electronic circuits is by re inventing them , by showing the circuit evolution [ wiki link : wikibooks : circuit idea philosophy a he uri stic approach the philosophy behind the circuit idea wikibook ] [ external link : a he uri stic approach to teaching analog electronics ] relies on human imagination , intuition and emotions . then let 's imagine how wilson has invented his current mirror by \" inventing \" and building it , in order to grasp the basic ideas behind the circuit and then to present them in an attractive manner to readers ! of course , it would be wonderful if the very wilson , if he is still alive , would expose how he was inventing the famous circuit\n",

' : registering should n't require commitment either . if even one person registers with the intent to use their account later , and finds their account deleted when they finally find the time , then unless the decision has improved the speed of the servers by a significant amount , it is a failure . : oppose ninety days is too short . learning to have an interest in and a commitment to wikipedia will take longer than a year for many . i have been using wp for a couple of years . i started and account to fix some stuff i saw . i still am a green horn about how to do a lot of stuff . putting in a obstacle for people with busy lives is just an unnecessary hurdle . if an account lies untouched for a year , then i think it makes more sense . right idea . too short a horizon : if you fixed some stuff you saw with your account , then your account will never be deleted . please read the proposed policy carefully .

in to any site finding my account is gone ! when necessary , an usurper can be pe formed . : no it ca n't . oppose . this does n't seem to have much benefit to the project compared to the amount of effort involved and feels like an attempt to snag some usernames ( ie first names ) that were taken several years ago and are inactive . : if they are inactive , and never edited , then why should they be kept ? i do n't understand the objection . oppose editing is not the only way we can help wikipedia . : could you clarify what you mean by this ? * i think he means that if we do something like donate to wikipedia , then we are helping as well , and that we do n't have to actually participate in order to help out . : * maybe he means that you can proofread without editing ? or talk wikipedia up to others ? i really ca n't think of a way to help , other than actual editing , that would require you to keep a username from which you never made an edit , and to which you did n't even sign in for more than days at a time . strong oppose . there are many valid reasons to have accounts with no edits ; to keep your preferences , to have an alternate watchlist , to have the same username on several projects ( there are people with accounts on all the wikipedias ) , to reserve a username ( like and the doppelganger usernames ) , and so on . just because someone has not logged in in a while , it does not mean he should lose his account . and emailing the owner of the accounts is n't enough ; we have accounts without an email address , unconfirmed email addresses , dead email addresses ( some people forget to change it when they change isps ) , agressive spam filters , broken email servers , and so on . oppose i really do appreciate what you 're trying to accomplish here , and it took me awhile to decide my vote , but in the end , in actual practice it does n't seem to serve a useful purpose . all that vandals sockpuppets will have to do is make one \" legitimate \" edit with their fake account and the account is safe for future use . meanwhile , legitimate users who , for whatever reasons , register and then not edit , risk losing their account . and of the , zero - edit accounts , how many were purely unused , and how many were simply d op pel gang ers ? plus , i imagine the number of unregistered vandal - user edits far outweighs the number of \" stale \" accounts , so the time resources needed to pull this off seems a low priority in my opinion . : there are ways to mark [ wiki link : wikipedia : doppelganger account doppelganger accounts ] , which requires making an edit to the account 's userpage . and since an edit was made to the page , the account can no longer be deleted . while anonymous edits by unregistered users may be a problem , this is just as much a problem . : i , um , know that . what i asked was , \" how many ? \" it 's been said that there around , ' zero - edit ' accounts , but how may of those are doppelganger accounts that simply have n't put the ' d op pel - template ' on their page ? is there even a way to know ? for all we know only , - , accounts are truly ' stale ' , that 's hardly an epidemic for a site accessed worldwide . like i said , the vandals are the ones who 'll know the rules better than the newbies , and will exploit the obvious loopholes ( i 'm not even a vandal , and i can see many ways to abuse this if it became policy . ) like i said , it is a good idea on paper ( on the screen ? ) , but in practice it 's simply not going to do any good , and only creates one more thing for vandals to mess around with , especially the sockpuppet variety . further , i find it really hard to believe that this is as big of a problem as non - registered user vandalization . oppose days is too short , once i had an eye injury and c ou l dent read , use the computer , or watch the tv for months : two months is only days . days is months and the proposed days is months . i do not see what is so complicated about that . i know it may be hard to see that sometimes , but wanted to clarify that . strongly support ! : did you mean to put this in the support section ? oppose at least until single - login is implemented . there has to be a reason we have - non - editing accounts , and without knowing what it is , i 'm loathe to change the status quo . i do n't actually see what it 's harming , and the way for vandals to get around it ( for the examples ) is trivial . sorry . : given your \" single - login \" objection , how about if we agree ( for starters ) to only erase usernames that do not exist on any other wikiproject ? : i 'm a sucker for data . the figure is an out lier for me , and i want to know why . for example , how many of those no - edit accounts exist under the same username on other wikia projects ? how many have items on their watchlist ? how does the creation rate compare pre - no - ip - page - creation and post - no - ip - page - creation ? how many names appear ( and this is subjective ) to be spam accounts ( random strings of characters , for a start ) ? oppose will hurt people who login only for the preferences and the watchlist who have to go away for a while . time period is too short . also will affect people on other projects re serving user names . : * oppose the time until delete should be longer for accounts with more edits . if it has only a few edits on one or two articles , days is fine . if it has significantly more edits to more articles , more consideration should be given to longstanding users who might end up on a wikibreak . : * : please read the proposal more carefully . accounts with any edits can not be deleted at all . ergo , an account with \" a few edits on one or two articles \" can not be deleted . this proposal only applies to accounts from which no edits have ever been made , and who have not logged in to their account for over days . : * : i misunderstood the policy , and my opposition has been re sc en ded . sorry ! oppose , i 'm \" parking \" user : cyde on many other language wikis to prevent impersonation , and under these guidelines , those would end up being deleted . likewise , people who speak other languages and are parking their user accounts here to prevent impersonation should n't be punished . : once [ wiki link : m : sul ] is implemented , this will no longer be an issue , but until then this is a valid concern . right now the best thing to do would be to create a userpage on the wikis where you parked the account ( perhaps with a soft redirect to your userpage ) then your account will be kept . : but i do n't remember any of those passwords ; i used throw - away passwords purposefully different from my en - wiki password ( for security reasons ) . i never intended to need to edit with them again ; parking indefinitely on that username is good enough . i ca n't help but think there are other people who 've done as i 've done and they 're going to be bitten by this days thing . : well using throwaway passwords means you will probably get all those accounts counted as conflicts when single login is imp li mented , with no way to associate them . so far as i can tell , sul will probably be imp li mented first , so by then you ( hopefully ) will have gotten a dev to reas sign the accounts for you . if using throwaway passwords is common , it would cause problems for both this , and [ wiki link : m : sul ] . about deleting blocked accounts . some editors have expressed reservations about deleting blocked accounts . i think that blocked accounts that meet the other criteria set forth above should be deleted . the concern is that deleting the account will leave the original creator free to recreate the account in an unblocked form . the vast majority of accounts that are blocked have been blocked precisely because of edits made under those accounts ; such accounts do not fall under this policy . the only way that an account gets blocked without ever having made any edits is if the username itself is highly offensive , an imposter , or uses a pattern of a known vandal , such as \" on wheels \" or \" is communism \" . the creators of such accounts are generally well aware that these accounts will be blocked immediately , and are not making long - term plans to use them . after days , the creator would likely have long forgotten that it had ever existed . if the creator would be inclined to recreate the same account ( surely only to be blocked again ) , this policy would not affect their ability to create an account with a nearly identical username , by having five exclamation points at the end instead of four , for example , or any number of other n once variations . thus , deleting these accounts offers no additional convenience to vandals whatsoever , as they can always create an account with a marginally different name . however , enacting this deletion policy will provide us with the great benefit of erasing many stupid and offensive usernames from the rolls of our user list . i therefore implore the community not to impose any limitation on the application of this policy based solely on the blocked status of an account to be deleted under it . cheers ! : actually , this strikes me as a good reason to keep blocked accounts : once we 've blocked \" on wheels \" , which we will do every time it 's created , we need never block it again ( and taking the effort to create it and failing may discourage the next vandal , which would be a [ wiki link : good thing ] . ) since an account with zero edits should be blocked only for inappropriate user name , this is , i think , the only question . : my point is , if we do n't delete these accounts , they stay in our database , and the vandal ( if inclined to make trouble ) simply takes the same amount of effort to make a slightly different offensive username . in short , if we do n't delete the account , we 'll end up having to block a different one , and will only increase the number of such perma blocked accounts in our database . besides , after days , hopefully that vandal will have found better things to do than bother wikipedia with offensive username registrations . however , i 'd be open to some compromise - suppose we agree to start with the oldest accounts first , as there are some never - used vandal accounts who have been blocked for years . knock out all unused blocked accounts that are more than a year old , and talk about proceeding with the rest after that is done . : i 'd be willing to simply add a note , commenting that there may be reasons to leave some blocked accounts , like and , in existence and perma blocked ; these may be as numerous as the indef - blocked attack accounts . : same rationale for deletion still applies . if vandalized and was blocked , the account can not be deleted ; if made an account but got blocked without ever having edited ( either because they never got the chance to make an edit or because they never intended to do so ) , i think it fairly safe to presume that days on , the creator of the account will have forge tten it ever existed , and will not go looking to re - create it in order to vandalize from it . furthermore , if the vandal does want to vandalize , he can just as easily create or . by leaving the account , we impose no extra work on vandals , but merely keep our list of users clogged up with nonsense . : i will add a note explaining that there is disagreement on this point . : i concur with ba on this . : to give an example of one of the two cases where i think it might be useful : is perma blocked as an impersonation account of . in this case , it was actually used ; but there are examples where such things were caught immediately . that should stay blocked . we do n't want anyone else picking it to impersonate the existing user ; and we do n't want some newbie picking it by accident . : that is food for thought - i can see a much stronger argument being made to keep blocked imposter accounts than to keep blocked or type accounts - are pretty much all imposters tagged as imposters , tho ? if they 're so tagged , i 'm sure we can set them aside for now and worry on them later . : not sure who ba is , but i agree with sep ten tri on alis ; deleting blocked imposter accounts just makes more work later . we 're not in a shortage of names currently , i see no need to go overboard . seems like it would be simple to make the bot software that is going to do these deletions skip over any account with a current block . : i presume he meant bd - anyway , my problem is that we have some really unpleasant and pointless \" attack \" usernames which would be great to get rid of ( and if they 've been around for more than days , it is probably harmless to destroy them ) . single login do n't know if this was mentioned before but would n't it be han di er to do this after single login is implemented ? many users on another wiki ( commons , foreign language etc ) made an account here to protect their name . and from what i 've heard single login does look now like it will be there in the foreseeable future . : wo n't such users want to trash all the individual accounts in exchange for a single login account then ? i concede , i 've made accounts on other wiki 's which i virtually never edit in order to protect this username . perhaps once this is implemented , we can have a notice posted on the other wikimedia projects for a short time to alert editors that old , unused wikipedia addresses are getting deleted , and the way to save them is to make an edit from them . : i assume there will be a way to join accounts . if so , then it would be better imo to wait till single login is implemented . it does n't seem that this proposal has to be implemented in a hurry anyway . it can wait ca n't it ? see also [ wiki link : meta : communications sub committees press pr sul this press draft ] . i saw referring to it recently . : well , i 'm not sure this proposal would affect anything for people who have cross - namespace usernames . either their old account will get booted for non use , or will get sucked into the new one . i presume that the single user account will not be deleted if there 's a single edit from it on any of the projects , but i also do n't want to hold my breath waiting for it to come about . my immediate concern is eliminating the unused offensive and insulting usernames created as a one - time gag . those should never be recast as single - user accounts either . : the only thing which could happen i think is that for instance the german equivalent ( famous admin name needed hmm ) tony sidaway has an empty account here , which he could lose if someone else registers it after the cleanup and makes a few minor edits on it . therefore making the account impossible to use for the german user . i have to admit that this scenario is not that likely to happen , but still . : there should be enough time so that he 'd be able to log into it for a certain amount of time , or make an edit to per serve the account . he came here to preserve his account by making it , i 'm sure he can come here to per serve it by logging in every so often or making an edit . : having a notice posted at every wiki project for a few weeks before we start deleting accounts should be enough to cover that concern ( although i 'd give obvious vandal attack accounts and inappropriate usernames no grace period ) . : all the obvious vandal and attack ac ounts of course can definitely be deleted . with all the other ones i still think it 's better to wait , just to be on the safe side . there 's no real hurry . : hm . how about if there was a way to check if the same username is registered on another project ? that way , we could immediately ( ) knock out the vandal attack accounts , and ( ) knock out unused no - edit accounts for which the name exists only on en . wikipedia ( which there must be a lot of , because my understanding is that en . wikipedia has orders of magnitude more accounts registered than any other wiki project ) . : it would be great if that 's possible . is there such a way ? : is n't there always ? i have great faith in the ability of technology to provide the solution ! : there 's [ external link : interiot 's single user login conflict checker ] but it 's pretty ( understandably ) slow . born h ji 'm thinking also about the scale of this undertaking . we 're talking here about deleting well over half a million never - used accounts - i doubt that can be done overnight . if we op ti mis tically say we 're going to delete , per day ( or one every seconds ) , it will take more than a month to knock out those that exist as of now . we must determine if we can set a priority order - the first thing to go should be any account that includes an obvious vulgarity or attack in the username , and once those are done we isolate those usernames that are unique to en . wikipedia and do knock them out in chronological order , deleting those longest unused first . perhaps we can introduce some other qualifiers like length of username or number of exclamation points ! ; - ) * well , we can always look at the [ external link : evil plans ] . [ wiki link : wikipedia : esperanza xd ] just a note : deleting usernames with or more edits . can not happen due to legal reasons . please read the [ wiki link : gfdl ] . sigh . : yes . that already was discussed here and on the project page though . : indeed , that is not what this proposal is about . implement ? this proposal has been voted on for days now , does anyone know when it is scheduled to end as there is virtually no opposition - with nearly a hundred and fi fe ty users voting in support and a mere opposing votes . just wondering . ' [ wiki link : special : emailuser lcarsdata ] ' : , [ wiki link : june ] [ wiki link : ] ( utc ) * i think a community portal bump might help us to hit - if we can say we got votes opinions in favour we can make the powers that be take notice . i 'll get bumping . [ wiki link : special : emailuser vanderdecken ] * we have reached . shouldnt this be closed by now ? theres overwhelming support for the proposal - : * closed by whom ? who has such authority ? i suppose someone would have to make a feature request , and then we wait . : i 'll contact jimbo . ' [ wiki link : special : emailuser lcarsdata ] ' : , [ wiki link : july ] [ wiki link : ] ( utc ) just one more point does the one edit count even if the person made the edit to their own userpage ? in that case , would something like be deleted since the user has only made one edit ever ? : just to clarify : conservative joe 's user page was deleted just recently . : two points - first , any edit to any page counts - this is a software limitation , not merely a policy matter , as unattributed edits can not exist ; second , it does not matter if the edited page is deleted , the edit still exists in the database ( and is viewable by admins ) . all - encompassing note in order to sa ti si fy everything about the gfdl and all : * no edits * no deleted edits * no oversight hidden edits * no log activity , except for new user . * no otherwise hidden log activity . in other words , there should be nothing about a user in any of the [ wiki link : special : log logs ] except for the username being created , including any otherwise hidden . the basic premise ? they can have done nothing that ended up on wikipedia for any amount of time except for being a new user . in this way , the original intention of ' unused ' is completely upheld . anything less will probably get tossed out . unused period there still seems to be a fairly arbitrary attitude to what the cutoff period should be , despite the proposal title of days . i wondering , is it possible to produce cumulative frequency statistics on how long accounts concerned by this policy have been idle ? that would give a more informed insight on how long or short to set it . i also still want to see a server admin say that this whole process will do the servers that much good . dissing the gis ? as a gi who occasionally spends seasons away from anything remotely resembling internet access , i find this topic - and the percentage of those who apparently approve of the proposition - discouraging . : please realize that this proposition is n't the slightest bit prejudiced against gis , or any other group . as discussed several times above and below , any user who makes any edit , even just posting a single comment here ( as you 've already done ) ensures that their username will never be deleted . this is a matter of both technical and legal requirements which can never be changed . the only accounts subject to deletion are the ones that have never made a single edit anywhere on wikipedia , and also have n't logged in within the past days . so if a gi ( or anybody else ) wants to ensure their account remains reserved even if they unexpectedly get kept away from the internet for an extended period of time , they just have to make a single comment ( like the one you just made , or even just on their on user page ) and they 're safe . : just make an edit to an article as soon as you make a username . that will cover it , and only takes seconds - : and , if you are n't in a position to make an edit within your first three months , just recreate the account when you get back from your mission . paradox has it occured to anyone that no one who will be affected by this proposal has ( or even can ) vote on this page ? : well , yes , but if you never edited at all , why would you want to vote ? basically this should not effect anyone , as all these accounts are stale , and would never have made any edits . : isnt that a good thing ? by voting here , people no longer fall under the cater ogy of inactive users , both ensuring their page 's survival and showing that they actually check what is going on in the wp community - : but if there is a valid reason that people get accounts and then ca n't edit with them , there is no way to find out about it . though there probably is n't one , i just thought it was an odd paradox : um , if you ca n't edit with your account , then you do n't need one ( and wikipedia does n't need you to have one ) . as my contracts professor would say , do n't lose sight of the fact that accounts exist only as a mechanism to assist users in improving wikipedia . true , we 're building an encyclopedia for the world , but anyone can read wikipedia , account or no . an account is only of use if an editor is using it to make improvements . : if they would not be able to edit with the account , how would that be able to create it ? all you need to do is make an edit as soon as you create your account , and you 're sorted . i dont see why this is such a problem . making a minor edit to your own talk page or user page takes seconds - votes over people have supported this now . is there any deadline to this , and does any developer actually know about this ? if not , someone should tell them . ) * i reposted this on community portal exactly a week ago with the ultimate motive of hitting votes . i was going to post a short about it on the administrator 's noticeboard or similar , but now i think i might leave it up to the original inventor of the policy , . i 'll drop him a line and ask what he thinks\n",

      "did n't i already specify , re specified again and again ? what , there is n't enough stuff on this page and the [ wiki link : killian documents ] about it ? well , this is a copy of the topic on my talk page in response to some \" points \" raised by , who \" orginally \" modified your initial mother 's day entry , that went over everthing in even more detail go knock yourself out finding fault in how it shows the entire mother 's day anecdote to be utter nonsense : well , i added your point about bush 's last day at the tex ang base to the mother 's day section . no original research , no speculation and no synthesizing , just the bare facts . is there anything particularly pressing that you 'd like me to edit while you 're blocked ? : hm . it 's such a huge list now , but let 's just look at the current \" mother 's day \" entry , shall we : tang pilot william cam pen ni disputed the document dated thursday may , , which ordered bush to report for a flight physical not later than may . according to cam pen ni , the squadron commander supposedly ordered bush to report on a weekend when the base was closed . the el lington air guard base was closed for mother 's day the weekend of may - . the next air guard drill weekend was may - . [ ] bush 's last day on base was monday , may , , according to the official record . : ) this bit , according to cam pen ni , the squadron commander supposedly ordered bush to report on a weekend when the base was closed , is directly contradicted by the very memo cam pen ni is referring to , which is also what you are now quoting . so why bring this up at all ? : ) cam pen ni wrote the column , letter to the editor , or whatever that was , and he 's neither a reporter nor a recognized reliable source , so that 's two strikes against him . : ) the memo was dated days in advance of the deadline , and that included weekends may was on a thursday that year . so that means there was both the weekend of may - and may - before bush left on the th , but that 's assuming that bush could only take his physical on a weekend and no other time there 's yet again no backing reference to support this . so claiming that the next air guard drill weekend was may - is an utter fabrication . you ca n't even speculate that the memo could have , maybe , might possibly taken days to reach bush because all bases have at least a mail room the memo would have been simply put in bush 's mail box when dropped off , meaning that it would have been in bush 's mailbox that thursday , or else first thing friday morning at the latest if it had been dropped off late thursday . : bush 's last day on base was monday , may , , according to the official record is not correct . the [ external link : official record ] said he \" cleared \" the base on the th , meaning that 's the day he left . so his last day on base was the th . : ) there is also no supporting reference to support cam pen ni 's assertion that an entire military base would be closed down for an entire weekend just because of mother 's day . google that bit all you want . : ) so all of this amounts no more than yet another confused and factually wrong anecdote floating around a handful of right wing websites , but nevertheless weaselly inserted into the wiki , and according to jimmy wales zero information is preferred to misleading or false information . : ) also you and [ wiki link : se wil co ] ( for starters ) seem to fit quite nicely in this definition . : when i 'm unblocked i have to first finish off a global warming thing i said i would do , and then the real fun and games will begin . : honestly , why are you and the others bothering with this malicious crap you know what all the evidence clearly shows , so why bother ? to be the bad guys ? just because ? whatever . - bc aka : are you aware that re ser vists drill one weekend a month ? not every weekend . if the memo was mailed , it went to the wrong address . if it was n't mailed , which any re serv ist will tell you is most likely , it sat in bush 's box at the base until he would come in to drill . bush 's last day on base is the day he left . he would n't be there at all on the th , since the base was closed for mother 's day . full - time support staff would be there on the monday to see bush off . cam pen ni says bush was ordered to report on a weekend that the base was closed , because orders to report usually have a deadline of an actual drill weekend . not a deadline that 's impossible , which is what a deadline ending a weekend when the base is closed would be . why do i bother ? precisely because i know what the evidence shows . if bush was ordered to take a physical , it would be in the official record , not coming from a \" personal file \" that no one knows exists , that has somehow escaped detection for decades , that has still not been found , but , according to one man with a mad on for bush and a history of lying , has suddenly produced six memos that look nothing like any documents from the tang and hilariously all pertain to bush . you want to prove your case ? find the rest of the file . find the originals . find what could have produced those memos . your idea that he must have typed them up in a law office is absurd as anyone with actual military experience will tell you . you do n't even need military experience to know that going to a law office to type up [ external link : this ] is ludicrous . : let 's cover yet again 's \" points \" : ) are you aware that re ser vists drill one weekend a month ? not every weekend . : air national guard pilots in ? do you know that they are under usaf rules ? cite ? : also , i thought to check bush 's flight logs and match his last flights to the days of the week via this calendar . this is what the records show for when he was on base ( and this for when flight hours had fallen off dramatically when compared to the prior years , ) : date aircraft hours day of week fa . wed toa . th urs toa . fri toa . sat sm fa sun toa wed fa . sun tfa . fri fa . th urs fa . sun fa . mon fa . tues fa . wed fa . sat fa . sun : ) if the memo was mailed , it went to the wrong address . if it was n't mailed , which any re serv ist will tell you is most likely , it sat in bush 's box at the base until he would come in to drill . : confused and absolutely baseless , nonsensical speculation not supported by a shred of evidence . an on - base memo by a commander written on thursday would be in mail room and in the recipient pilot 's mailbox that day or by the following morning , friday , at the latest . also that was the correct address it appears in other dod records like this one . yet another fabrication . : ) bush 's last day on base is the day he left . : the official record has killian saying the bush \" cleared \" the base on may , , a monday . . unless bush did n't pack up his stuff to leave until the very end of that day , then the th would have been his last regular day on base . in this case , though , there is slight wiggle room for inter pre tion , so let the record speak for itself . : ) cam pen ni says bush was ordered to report on a weekend that the base was closed , because orders to report usually have a deadline of an actual drill weekend . : not only is cam pen ni a dubious , highly biased source an old friend of bush with no demonstrable reason given to believe him a credible , reliable source but he is also very clearly lying here : the may , memo that cam pen nis refers to shows killian giving bush full days to get the physical , to quote : \" not later than ( nlt ) may , \" . also there is no evidence for any military air base closing down for an entire weekend because of mother 's day . but this point has been dealt with over and over , so you know all this . do you think endless repeating a lie and an apparent fabrication will somehow make them true eventually . ? : ) if bush was ordered to take a physical , it would be in the official record , not coming from a \" personal file \" that no one knows exists . : bush was verbally suspended by killian from flying , because he did n't take his physical . that 's certainly in the official records : and . but none of the dod records , , show any warning or even mention given in advance . since it 's ludicrous to think any responsible commander would suspend one of his pilots over a matter like a missing physical without some advance warming and certainly not without some attempt to try to re ci fy the matter in time , there would have been at least some documents , memos or whatever , to this effect . if these killian memos are not real , then where are the \" real \" records for this situation ? misplaced by the dod ? thrown in a dump ster ? the dog ate them ? check out this lesser known killian memo ( \" for file \" ) dated may , , just a few days after bush had left for alabama , and where killian notes a phone call he had with bush : . physical . we talked about him getting his flight physical situation fixed before his date . says he will do that in alabama if he stays in a flight status . he has this campaign to do and other things that will follow and may not have the time . i advised him of our investments in him and his com mi tt ment . he 's been working with stuff to come up with options and identified a unit that may accept him . i told him i had to have written acceptance before he would be transferred , but think he 's been talking to someone upstairs . : is n't that exactly ' the sort of thing a commander would right in this situation , either as a personal memo for file or in a more official note to another military official ? if this is n't the real one , then where . ? well ? : - bc aka\n",

that could be the source of ho oton 's numbers ? * even more so , recent extended research by the stu die gro ep lu ch to or log ( in coop with nimh ) has shown even higher figures . by the way , ho oton is a terrible source . * then we had best mention these new numbers ! have they been published and what is the citation ?

* tan ke ttes is a french word and as such inappropriately used here . the vickers car don - lloyd carriers are usually referred to as ' carriers ' , ' mg carriers ' or ' general carriers ' . moreover , the ( two ) carriers were not ' overwhelmed ' but simply knocked out by the bomb - raid ( off ) and mechanical failure ( off ) . * the last is certainly an improvement ! however , \" tan ke tte \" is english and the type in question is commonly called the [ wiki link : car den loyd tan ke tte ] you see , it even has its own lemma ! but it 's true that later - on , when the tan ke tte concept fell into disgrace , basically the same type was marketed and ultimately mass - produced as an universal carrier . * that is news to me . peculiar is that pre - war dutch papers already speak of ' car don lloyd carriers ' . carrier is a much more accepted term and i would consider ' tan ke tte ' wrong wording . * well , it simply is the official designation of this particular vehicle , i believe . it was bought in the early th ir ties ; quite possibly the dutch in the late th ir ties adopted the changed english usage . * i am not going to battle of this * the mo er di jk bridge head was only ' fortified ' on the south side . not on the north side , so ' both ends ' is inaccurate . * good point . * the ' hand stre ich ' plan to raid bridges was not made by hitler personally . nice myth though . it was designed by can aris and von hip pel . the basic plan came out of the meeting in berlin at sept where the ob dh , ob d km , ob dl and the ob - ab wehr met with hitler and his staff . upon the assessment by the generals present that the maas bridges were essential log istic es sets , the plan arose to siege those by stealth commando raids , which had been done before elsewhere . only in february the dutch bridges were added . besides next to the brand en burger operated the bat allion z bv . son der ver band hoc ke ( maastricht ) was comprised of men from both units . * it 's a myth mentioned by many books , so it would be very desirable to have a source for it being one . bat allion z bv should certainly be mentioned . * like which source ?

      "in order to reduce the amount of text we are generating on your talk page i have gone ahead and moved my original proposal post [ external link : here ] . i needed to input some text on the user page of my \" sandbox account \" in order to \" knock it \" out of its default \" edit mode \" and that standalone post seemed like a good candidate for a chunk of text to post over there . so now my \" sandbox account \" contains the initial proposal for the suggested pst improvement on the user page and the latest version of the strawman implementation of that proposal on the talk page . let 's keep the ongoing discussion of the proposal strawman implementation here for now . as we reach closure on issues that arise here we could perhaps also use the user page of my \" sandbox account \" for archiving further chunks of text off of your talk page to further reduce the clutter here . : i 'd be happy to roll this out . i see in the other sandbox linked that you 've only got the one column stating squad statuses - are you just waiting for the official announcements of the squads for each competition ? before , you had the three columns . i 'm willing to go with your not adding certain fringe members , too - see my recent comments further up my talk page where i essentially say that i 'm willing to drop the issue for the sake of peace of mind - though i 'd appreciate getting those outside judgments before going any further with it . : i consider this to be a two phase process . phase is adding the \" squad status \" column as an \" attribute \" of each player . and that is the version of the \" updated pst section \" that is in the talk page of the sandbox account created by gonads ( with just that one column added along with the defining text and table ) . phase is adding the third \" squad \" columns in each of the epl and europa cup competition columns to the above phase update after that has been \" rolled out \" ( as you just assured me you are about to do ) . the current status of the phase updates and experimentation with the ideas we are throwing around is in the talk page of my own sandbox account ( \" mancini 's sandbox \" ) . the user page of that same sandbox account contains my \" archived \" ( but nevertheless kept current with the latest developments ) text of my original proposal ( as i just explained in the text at the start of this section above ) . : the reason for the phasing is because the addition of the \" squad status \" column is relatively un contentious , but more importantly , it also contains information that people need now as they try and work out what the new - man squad provisions entail for their favorite epl teams ' squads come the start of the season end of this month . otoh , we clearly have quite a few issues to resolve before we can come up with a complete and elegant solution for phase . not only that , even if we had the design all sorted out , ready to go and pat today , we still could not publish phase because we do n't know the actual - man squads until they are announced for each of the two competitions come august . anything published by us before that date would be un ci table speculation on our parts . so we have minimally until the end of this month to get the design of phase sorted out . once published , phase will also take on a life of its own ( i 'm assuming ) and will be improved by other editors , rather than simply reverted because it was \" not invented here \" and or posted by a newbie . which is why i want you to post it . : having said all that , the issues you raised in your last paragraph in the next section below re the fact that uefa have slightly different stated requirements stat i for \" hgp \" players is pertinent to the phase updates ( and , of course , phase because it sub sum es phase ) . so , since you have not done the roll out of phase yet , perhaps you should wait a little longer ( omg , i hate to hear myself say that ! ) until i can follow all the implications of that issue through to their conclusions and fix it accordingly ( if it needs fixing ) . i 'll post back here ( as an indent to this post ) when i think it is ready to go ( it will probably be later today for me , but it may be beyond midnight your time ) . alternatively , you could go ahead with the roll out of the phase release tonight and i 'll do the fixes ( if any required ) in the actual article . but we 've waited all this time since the weekend with the table ready to go so i guess another day will not hurt . : any changes to phase ( as it currently is in [ external link : this sandbox ] ) will possibly require coming up with a th ( and possibly even a th , etc . ) \" squad status \" code ( s ) and rec l assi fying some of the players accordingly ( if necessary ; it is possible to have valid \" squad status \" codes for which city currently do not have any players that fulfill that status ) , as well as adding to the table and inline introductory sections more text that defines the new \" squad status \" code ( s ) , and or modifying the current table and inline introductory section text that defines the current four \" squad status \" codes . one thing i 'm considering doing is adding a new column to my summarizing table that maps uefa terminology ( taken from the appropriate sections of the europa league and champions league rules and regulations wrt player eligibility ) to our own \" generic terminology \" that is a synthesis of both the epl and uefa terminology . of course , a column also needs to be added for the epl to map its \" player eligibility \" terminology to our own \" all embracing \" generic terminology , but like you , i still have n't seen the source text published by the premier league to rightly know what terminology actually is . : consequently , such an update might best be rolled out as a phase a improvement to what we already have once i actually have the source text for all three competitions . i also need the equivalent text for the uefa super cup competition to do a complete job , but i really do n't want that stupid non - competition to hold things up here . the super cup does not involve any british teams so imo we have until the end of august next year to tweak anything that it might require . not only that , the two teams that play in it are also automatically qualified as defending champions in the two other main uefa competitions , so presumably their - uefa squad registrations for competing in either of those competitions simply carries over to the single super cup final game . or maybe the last - squad re - registrations of those teams simply applies . but it really does n't matter , does it , because i do n't necessarily see city playing in the super cup within the next year or so ! ( talk : take a look at the updates i 've done to the squad status codes definition table in the [ external link : phase sandbox ] . i 've tried to incorporate all the terminology that uefa uses in its \" player eligibility \" section of the \" europa league rules amd regulations \" pdf that you linked me to and map it to the existing terminology i was using . note well that the introductory inline text before the summary table has not been touched in this go - around and is now inconsistent with the table that is meant to summarize it ! i need to do a similar set of updates to the table for the epl terminology when i can get my eyeballs on a similar pdf - hence the blank \" t bd \" column . however , since most of the existing terminology i came up with was based on second and third sourced materials ( such as that man . united message board discussion ) from which i had gained my own understanding of the new epl registration requirements , there is a good chance that there will be a high correlation between my existing terminology and the actual epl terminology when i do see the pdf file - in which case i might be able to shed one column . : what this exercise has taught me is that it might take a quite awhile to resolve all this and fix the table and all the existing text so that they will match again . however , i have not yet seen a reason to change or add to any of the current squad codes yet . let me know if you like the direction this is going in . it mt i would recommend that you roll out the current version of the phase pst ( in the other sandbox ) and these changes can then follow in a later phase a update to it . we need to start getting feedback ( a . k . a . \" consensus \" ) from the other mcfc editors of those phase updates asap anyway . also read my response to your last paragraph in the next section on this topic . : just as an aside here , i 've also updated in that phase sandbox the europa league squad column from my earlier hypothetical - man squad to the list of mancini 's named players that was released today - it actually was n't that much different ! ) . both sandboxes reflect the removal of on u oha from the squad due to sunderland duty . the surprises in mancini 's - man europa league squad announced today is that it included michael johnson and sh ale um logan , neither of whom has kicked a ball publicly in any of the pre season games ( and accordingly i had just assumed johnson was still not fit yet and logan was playing with vidal and e tu hu over in the eds ) . so two europa slots left and mancini is stalling on what he intends to do with bellamy , ireland , silva and j . his - man squad contained strikers , mid fi el ders , defenders , and goalkeepers ( which i personally feel is an extra vag ance given that the club is allowed to draft in another go alie in an emergency situation if it has to - just like city did last season with f l p - and that given and hart have both been very vocal about not knowing what they are going to do if they do n't get the first choice go alie slot ) . : the current acg - hgp - for spread for the squad is - so any of the above four players could be added without restriction . as you pointed out elsewhere , the bal o tel li purchase , should it be completed , will not cost city a list a slot since he is under , but the potential purchase of milner presumably accounts for mancini 's pro c ra st ination over one of those slots . bellamy 's press statement before the wales game seemed to indicate that he suspected he would not make the cut for the first , and there is really no surprises that ireland has n't made the cut , but i felt j had done enough to earn himself a place , and i 'm baffled why david silva has been left out given all the money that has just been spent on him . what are your thoughts on this ? talk : incidentally , i believe kolarov 's number is now citable . [ external link : this article ] shows the club official picture at the un ve iling of the four new sign ings , and if you want a club source on that picture ( or rather , and equivalent ) , you can see one by skipping to the very end of [ external link : this os video ] . : yes , i saw the video ( i usually check in on the mcfc web site - which incidentally is imo the best one of all the epl teams , and i 'm not being sky - blue partisan when i say that - most days and minimally watch all the new videos ) and made the same mental note as you just pointed out when i saw kolarov and all the new players holding their allocated shirts up with mancini . i also liked some of that daily mail article , although , as a rule , i think the daily mail web articles are pretty crap . i recently gained a new level of respect for gary line ker for his quitting of the dm over the part the dm played in the lord tri es man fiasco . good on him . now , if only wayne rooney had such a conscience ! i usually stick to the bbc and the various club web sites for my soccer epl info . and possibly the guardian or the telegraph . and , of course , your very own wikipedia articles ! ) : here 's what i would like to do wrt kolarov and his new shirt number . roll out the phase pst , when we do roll it out , as is with his squad number starred as needing a citation , just so that people get used to seeing that concept in action . rather than use the dm article as the cited source ( which we could add right now ) i would prefer to see an mcfc web site source cited for it ( and not that minute long pres ser video either , but just a regular piece of text ) , so until that becomes available kolarov can remain there with his shirt requiring citation for as long as it takes . what 's more , if this process works properly , because of the \" citation needed \" prompt , someone will find the citation that 's required and add that missing citation for us at the bottom of the article and replace the asterisk next to his shirt number with the appropriate source reference superscript . but all this current crap of blanking his number for lack of citation , then someone else adding his number back in again , then someone blanking his number again , and on , needs to stop imo . it looks to the outsider to be as childish as it really is . : you might also need to go get people such as pee jay ( and possibly others ) to go read what i just wrote above ( as well as that s ruff over on my talk page re the carlos t vez example , etc . ) so that he buys into this concept too . it 's not as though it 's radical , because it 's how wikipedia is friggin ' meant to work ! so my suggestion is to use the kolarov squad number as an educational test case for others as i just outlined . let mr know your thoughts when you can . talk discussion of uefa and epl re - registration frequency re the proposed changes to the pst i 'm largely in favour of this , though i want to raise one point : do we actually know how often a squad can reissue it 's - man selection ? because if it 's at any time more frequently than the end of each transfer window , i 'd venture that it could prove problematic resolving how you classify a player who was included in the - man once , then was removed for a month , then was put back in , or something like that . also , while the club is waiting to sell players and has more players than the - man rule allows ( even accepting that u - s are n't counted ) how do you propose to represent the - man squad when we do n't know exactly who wo n't be included . and do we yet know what ruling the pl is using over who counts as an under - ? as i 've mentioned somewhere before , the pl has previously tended to be quite inclusive , leading to some cases of - year olds playing for under - sides for the countries and such . : i do not have the time to google a citable source for you , but i 'm pretty ( ) certain that both the epl and uefa squad registration deadlines are synchronized to the end of the summer and january transfer windows for the reasons i explained in my final paragraph of my original post ( in the \" going forward \" section below ) . with some minor differences those two transfer windows apply across almost all the uefa nations , all of which play a fall - winter - spring season , although as we keep hearing re england 's disappointing performance in the world cup last month , england ( and probably scotland too ? ) is one of the few countries that actively continues playing through its winter transfer window . i most definitely know that the deadline for the initial registering of all the epl squads for the upcoming season is august , which is indeed the same as the end of the summer transfer window . thus a club can sign its new star striker on the final day of the transfer window ( and how often have you seen that happen ? does the name robin ho ring any bells ? ) and register him to play in the epl that same day . so the short answer is , \" yes , it 's only twice a year ( citation needed ) \" ! : the example you describe of a player being initially registered in an epl squad , and then removed from it for a month , and then put back in again , etc . would indeed be a problem . it would also be an administrative nightmare ! which is why it does n't work that way . wrt \" how do you propose to represent the - man squad when we do n't know exactly who wo n't be included ? \" the answer is : exactly like [ external link : this ] . imo , this sandbox version of the current \" squad table \" section that gonads and i worked on ( before you came online today ) is ready to go ( meaning it could be used to overwrite the existing \" squad table \" section right now ) . as i explained in the first paragraph of the \" updating the pst \" section above , all this first update does is essentially co dify the current first team squad players into four separate pools . : there is nothing speculative or particularly contentious in adding this new column in the way that it has been set up in the sandbox . the co di fication in the new column merely represents the effective conjunction of two pieces of individually citable information that already exists for every player currently listed in your own created \" squad table \" - viz . , his current age and his junior playing ( club registration ) history prior to age . an interpretation of both the uefa and epl player registration provisions ( also externally citable , but i paraphrased them for you in steps a and b above ) is then applied to those two pieces of citable fact in order to arrive at a resultant classification for each player that is then codified with a tla . : apropos your \" the pl has previously tended to be quite inclusive , leading to some cases of - year olds playing for under - sides for the countries and such \" i quite agree . and the reason for your observation is fully explained by the \" under player provision \" i paraphrased for you in \" step a \" above . read it again very , very carefully and note well that determining january threshold . thus a young player that turned years of age this past january is considered to be \" under \" wrt the upcoming season , and he will be years and months old when it ter min ates in may . i hope that adequately addressed all your raised concerns . : i 'll give you a longer reply later but sufficed to say this : uefa has several reconfirmation periods for squads . there 's after january yes , but you also have to confirm your squad at the end of each \" tier \" of competition . by that i mean qualifying rounds , then the play - off round , then the group stages , then the knock - out rounds , and there might even be a chance to change your squad before the final too . it 's not just when there 's a transfer window that uefa make you re confirm your squad . i doubt the pl will match date for date the confirmation periods and i also doubt they will only have two , but i 'm not sure . : i hear you . when i stated above i was pretty certain that was more aimed at the epl process . i 'm pretty certain ( based on a lot of stuff i 've read , but little of it official ) that the epl registration process is only a two - step affair - once at the end of august and then again at the end of january . but even then i 'm not certain how radically within the same season these two squads can differ - viz . , can mancini register a completely different - man squad in january than he does in august ? not that even city can afford to have that many good players ( ) simply sitting around t wi ddling their thumbs until then ! i 'm assuming that \" tweaks \" of a few player sw aps ( viz . or ) are allowed to the august - man squad in the january registration of the - man squad ( in fact , i believe it is actually called a \" re - registration \" , implying the new squad for the second half of the season can not differ by too big a factor ) . also , i 'm similarly not clear on who mancini can play in august before he has to initially register his epl squad . can he play any of his players during the first two weeks of the season , or does he have to register on august any players that have already played in epl games ? : other stuff i have read had led me to believe that the epl process was essentially modeled on the uefa squad registration process that was already in place . since city were not pushing the squad limits when they played in the uefa cup two seasons ago i really did not pay much attention to this issue then , and ditto last season when the team was not competing in europe . so i am hardly a subject matter expert on the uefa squad registration requirements . here is [ external link : something ] that supports my take on the uefa situation . hardly an official text i know ( and only the first couple of posts are worth reading ) . but those posts do suggest that your understanding that the squads can or must be re - registered before every tier of the two uefa competitions is anomalous . i 'm not by any means saying you are wrong . i offer this only as gri st for the mill of this discussion . : of course , none of the above has any ramifications whatsoever on the initial co dif ying of the players in city 's first team squad into four pools of player eligibility ( which i believe to be information that is much more pertinent to any given player 's ability to clock up statistics in the upcoming season than , for instance , displaying the flag of that player 's nationality ) . the issue of squad registration frequency only affects whether it would be wise to try and go beyond my basic classification of the players into pools , and further indicate in the pst the actual named squads once they have both been submitted , or whether doing so would only be an open invitation to edit warring due to how often the makeup of these squads changed during the course of the season . even only changing twice ( every august and january ) might still be too frequent from that perspective . : i 've spent quite some time since my last post above trying to find the official text of the squad registration requirements on the official web sites of both uefa and the premier league with absolutely no luck . one would think both of those sites would have a section dedicated to it prominently displayed . or at least a faq section dedicated to the topic . and they may well do , but i 've not been able to locate it yet on either site . after i came across that manchester united message board web page and the comment there that was quoting text from uefa . com site i similarly spent quite a bit of time trying to locate a source version of that text , also with no luck . which is why i posted the link to the united mb discussion because it is still the best coverage of this topic that i could come up with . however , i 'm not at all happy with it because it is not a primary source and technically it is merely hearsay ( which , of course , is how most people are learning about the ramifications of the new ruling ) . it was only because that one poster seemed to be quoting the official text of the ruling from the uefa . com web site that i used it above . i 'll still keep looking for a better source of information . it mt , if you know of a link to the source text of either of the epl and uefa squad registration rulings please post them here so that we can base any discussion of this issue going forward on the actual rulings rather than on gossipy ( mis - ) interpretations of them . thanks . : btw , i am assuming that the same uefa squad registration requirements apply to all three of its competitions and that there is not a separate one for each of the champions league , the europa league and the super cup ! please lord , let that be the case ! ( : you are most probably right that you ca n't register an entirely new squad of after the january transfer window , but it only requires one player to be an exceptional case and good planning and negotiation such as this can go out of the window , of course . but yeah , you 're right . i do n't know why i did n't bother looking for the rules of the competitions in question , but i took a gander myself and found [ external link : the uefa regulations for the - europa league ] and [ external link : this page ] of links for the handbook for the premier league this season . while the europa league rules appear to back you up and stick closely to the champions league rules in that thread of the un mention able team that you cited , the pl seems f ru str atingly vague about the whole thing , but maybe i just have n't found the right section yet . at any rate , as a by - product of this whole thing , i have been able to confirm that the rd strip is officially white all over ( bar the s ash on the kit and socks ) and not white - and - black , and we do indeed appear to be using the green goalkeepers kit again , which it was my mistake to dismiss earlier . also i now know some extra board of director names to stick on the [ wiki link : man city ] article , but whatever . at any rate , it seems that you 're probably right about the restrictions in re - registration . i believe the rule about games up to the end of august is that you have to register every player who plays ( i . e . when they sign ) , but you can re - register a squad as many times as you need before the st of september deadline , by the way - the nature of evolving transfers makes that necessary . obviously , after the transfer window is closed it then becomes final . : one thing that came to mind while skimming over those regulations pdfs , however , was the notion that the uefa competitions have somewhat different squad statuses for players than the pl does . for instance , the two governing bodies disagree over the definition of \" home - grown \" . uefa insists it goes by nationality iirc , the pl does n't . also , uefa wo n't let you include unlimited u - s whereas the pl will , etc . will your table include a second list of squad status abbreviations to cover this or do you intend to find a way of merging the two together somehow ? : this is a response to your last paragraph above only . apropos your , \" uefa insists it goes by nationality iirc , the pl does n't , \" that 's not true - see my new column in the table in the phase sandbox ( also see my comments in the section up above , which btw i 'm assuming you 've read before you started reading this - but i probably should n't assume that ! ) . : apropos your , \" uefa wo n't let you include unlimited u - s whereas the pl will , \" that 's also not true - uefa specifically states that an unlimited number of u players can be re gi ster d via list b . wrt your last sentence asking about what my strategy for all of this is , see all my response text up above in the previous section . finally , take a look at the age definition of what constitutes an u player ( list b player ) in that europa league pdf and compare the defining cutoff date to what i 've defined it to be in in the epl section of my sandbox ( either sandbox will do currently ) . do you think they are equivalent ? i 'm not going to tell you what i think until i hear your opinion . talk : they are n't the same . the uefa rules have that thing about needing to be eligible for the club for two years since your th birthday - the wording is n't good but it suggests they 've got to have been on the club 's books for a while to count as an under - . it also suggests that an under - would have to register as an over - in order to play because of that ruling too . : i 'm afraid i missed that subtlety . but i think it 's exactly the same vaguely - worded paragraph that we are both trying to de construct the true intended meaning out of here . just so we are both singing from the sane sheet i 'll quote it directly below . : \" . a player may be registered on list b if he is born on or after january and has been eligible to play for the club concerned for any uninterrupted period of two years since his th birthday by the time he is registered with uefa . players aged may be registered on list b if they have been registered with the participating club for the previous two years without interruption . \" : what caught my attention was that \" january \" cutoff date , which is what was behind my above question . that would make list b players \" under \" players rather than \" under \" as com par ably defined for the epl , which even then means that year - olds can be validly playing in the second half of the season ( after january ) as i indicated to you up above in my first response in this section . however , as you point out , that \" year prior registration with the same club requirement \" does make the uefa requirement somewhat different ( viz . more restrictive ) than the comparable epl requirement as i understand it ( without the comparable source pdf text put out by the epl ) . although i stated yesterday in a section above that i did not believe we needed more than the current status codes , that was written before i started my analysis of the above quoted paragraph which was pretty late last night ( my time ) and i was very tired . but i suspected i needed a new \" u \" code or something ( for that uefa situation ) if my initial take of that date was correct , so i decided to throw out the question to you and get your opinion of that date threshold and get some sleep and think about it again today with a fresh mind . : the other implications of that text were lost on my sleepy brain last night , but i now agree with you . there at least implications buried in that . paragraph that make that uefa list b \" youth player \" requirement quite different from the epl \" u \" requirement as i have it currently defined . but we only need one difference between the two youth player provisions in order to require a new th status code - which we now do . the pst section of your season article is not the place for us to define the mundane nic eties of the various provisions as stipulated by uefa and the english fa ( or is it the epl itself ? i ask that aside here because these players have to be registered with the english or welsh fas , not the epl , in order to be accepted as being registered with uefa ) . all we need to understand is that there is a difference between the two sti pu lations ( thus requiring codes not ) and which code sub sum es the other one , so that i can stipulate - as i think is the case here - that any player satisfying the uefa \" youth \" provision automatically satisfies the epl one ( in the same manner that all uefa \" acg \" players , as i have them currently defined , also satisfy the epl \" hgp \" provision ) . the difference in detail , and which provision ( and thus which squad status code ) sub sum es the other , is all that matters to us , not every jot and tittle of those differences in detail . : so the up shot of all this is that i need to add a new code to the squad status code definition table in the phase sandbox ( just that one for now ) , which is what i believed i would have to do before i went to bed last night ( actually it was late early morning for me ) and threw out that question at you to focus your attention on that text ( which is clearly what you had been focused on when you had written your last paragraph above ) . just for the record , my take on the three differences between the uefa and epl \" youth or junior player \" provisions that must be met for list b player registration ( for uefa ; i have no idea what the epl call it ) is as follows : * youth player maximum age provision \" under \" ( for epl ) but \" under \" ( for uefa ) - or , however you want to express it , the two maximum age thresholds for determining whether a player is a senior player or not differ by one year . : * a youth player satisfying the above epl maximum age provision ( e . g . , mario bal o tel li ) could play in an epl game for a club such as city only hours after being transferred in and registered by that club with the epl ; while even though that same player satisfied the comparable ( older ) maximum age provision set by uefa , he would have to be registered on the books of his new club for a further years before he was eligible to be registered ( via list b ) to play in an uefa competition game . : * a youth player satisfying the above epl maximum age provision ( e . g . , a year old wayne rooney at everton ) could play in an epl game without being a registered member of the - man epl squad ; while even though that same player satisfied the comparable ( older ) maximum age provision set by uefa , in order for him to be eligible to play in an uefa competition game he would have to be registered in the - man uefa squad via one of the \" free player \" slots on list a ( because he fails to meet the years months minimum threshold to qualify to be registered in one of the \" acg \" or \" hgp \" list a slots ) . : please confirm asap that the above is your understanding too , or alternatively give me your interpretation of this stupid piece of \" legal verbiage \" . it mt , i will go add and document the new \" youth \" squad status code in the definition table that summarizes my four existing squad status codes . fyi , i 'm not going to update any inline text above that table until we are both happy with the table contents . then , and only then , will i go back and modify the above inline text to make it expound upon and be more consistent with the contents of the table . also , when you respond back here , give me your feedback on how you feel about my essentially handling all of the subtle distinctions between the uefa and epl - man squad provisions in the two new columns i 've introduced . : finally , wrt your other comment in your final paragraph above - viz . \" . the two governing bodies disagree over the definition of ' home - grown ' . uefa insists it goes by nationality iirc , the pl does n't . \" - i believe my distinction between \" hgp \" and \" acg \" captured that disagreement . or did you have something else in mind that i have missed ? let me know asap if you did . talk strawman pst re the handling of mancini 's actual registered - man squads here 's a [ external link : strawman pst ] for how we might handle , come august , mancini 's submitted squad assignments for the epl and europa league competitions . note that the \" acg \" status players s re simply enumerated as \" hgp \" players for the epl squad because there is no \" acg \" requirement for the epl . both of the - man squads in my example pst utilize \" for \" players and \" hgp \" players , with the uefa squad specifically identifying which four of the \" hgp \" players satisfy the \" acg \" requirement ( thus the squad makeup is - ) . all the u players are currently shown as being in both squads as they can play in any competition - but because of that it might be better style to just leave their fields blank ( on the basis that there also a lot of eds players not listed in the pst , such as ben mee , that could play too ) . also , to make the squad colum s a little thinner it might be a better idea to use just the first letter of the tla codes in these columns . thus the epl squad players would be identified h - h and f - f , and the uefa squad players a - a , h - h , and f - f . the two squads show given and taylor being utilized as the goalkeepers in the epl squad , with hart and taylor as the two goalkeepers in the uefa squad . in reality , mancini will probably use three goalkeepers in both squads ( but maybe not ) . j is only used as a striker in the uefa squad while ca ice do takes his slot in the epl squad . i did a similar squad split for on u oha and michael johnson . anyway , you get the idea . : anyway , back on the matter at hand , i actually do n't mind that at all - i quite like it actually . i 'm tempted to say that the first \" squad status \" column is superfluous but i can see how it could be useful in rare circumstances . : actually , it was my initial choice of the new squad en co dings that really contains the superflous element that you are observing . so i have modified them to just a single character plus number as i had suggested might be an improvement above . unfortunately , doing that does n't reduce the column width of these two new columns because the minimum width is determined by the column heading \" squad \" string . : ideally , in these two new columns , i merely require to enumerate the various squad slots being filled by the players . i could just as easily opted to assign numbers from to in all the \" for \" player slots , then gone back and assigned numbers from to in the \" hgp \" slots . that would be an unique encoding of the information i want to capture , but unfortunately it would also be very per ple xing for the reader . although adam johnson 's \" hgp \" squad status plus the number placed in the epl squad cell is sufficient information to identify him as the player occupying the seventh \" hgp \" slot in the epl squad , the fact that there is another number in that same column identifying felipe ca ice do as the player similarly occupying the seventh \" for \" slot in the epl squad becomes very confusing to the reader . things get even more confusing over in the uefa squad column where the numbers - would be used three times over . thus a minimum of a single letter is needed to distinguish the use of the same numbers in the same columns . : your comments elsewhere tell me you 're onboard with the above issue ( viz . that the information in the two competition squad columns is not really just a redundant repetition of what is encoded in the left most \" squad status \" column ) , so you can now delete the above paragraphs plus this one . : talk : i think of the tla in the left most pst column as a \" quality \" of that player . for example , addy 's \" for \" status tells you that if he is utilized in a squad , either the epl squad or the uefa squad ( or possibly even an fa cup squad should the f . a . introduce similar squad registrations for that competition four years from now ) , then he will occupy consume one of the designated \" foreign \" slots in that squad . thus addy 's \" for \" status tells you something about the limits on how he can be utilized in any squad for which he is selected , just as his \" position \" status of \" fw \" tells you something about the limits of how he can be utilized out on the actual field of play ( viz . that ideally he should not be playing in goal or as a center - back ! ) . : i know you 've seen what i 've done with the above text ( in terms of word s mi thing and improving ) over in the new \" squad status codes \" section of my \" archived \" version of the original proposal in my sandbox , so you can go ahead and delete it from up above ( because we do n't need two versions of it ) . talk : i also view this [ external link : latest sandbox ] update as just speculative experimentation as to how we might possibly encode actual registered squads should we determine that they will not be a source of major edit wars down the pike . it is entirely possible that we might still not choose to go so far as doing that . however , i view what we have here in our [ external link : first sandbox ] as pretty much ready to go ( meaning i would be happy doing that update edit to the article right now ) . it probably needs the text you are requesting below adding in first ( and i 'm currently thinking about the best way to do that ) but in terms of the co di fication accuracy and general layout , etc . i think it is good to go right now ( while how we actually represent the registered squads probably still needs quite a bit more scrubbing back and forth between us ) . oh , i would also like a second opinion on shay given 's status from you before we publish ( and be damned ! ) . : fyi , my first pass at the required explanatory text has now been added . i await your feedback on it plus your input re shay 's \" hgp \" status . : shay given is home - grown . he had played for blackburn for three seasons by the end of the season in which he turned , which is exactly the minimum of what the pl requires to call someone home - grown . : yep pers , that was my take too , but i just wanted a second opinion since he was the only player that came close to not satisfying that hgp requirement out of all the hgp players . issue closed . you can delete this and the above paragraphs . talk : fal a stu r , i need your feedback on the text i added to both versions of the strawman pst update ( it 's the same text in both sandboxes ) asap . i would also like your views on the status of shay given re whether he meets the \" hgp \" criterion although i 'm willing to stick my neck out on that one . it would eventually be corrected over time anyway . otoh , the more mistakes or questions of style in my proposed update to your article when it is actually made then the more reason for immediate reversion . please note the following well . i believe the strawman update in the \" first sandbox \" ( see paragraph just above ) as pretty well ready for publication barring other feedback comments from you ( and if you still have some , even if only minor n its , then i want to hear it ) , while the more advanced strawman update in the \" latest sandbox \" ( also see paragraph just above ) is still a work in progress that builds on the other one . think of them both as being phase and phase of the ultimate update . i want to see phase published asap before it becomes yesterday 's news . and i would like you to be the person that does the update because ( whatever you say to the contrary ) it is less likely to be immediately reverted that way . : i need to see your current level of concurrence on this issue specific aly stated here asap . either ( ) yes , i think we are good to go with phase and i ( meaning you ) will do the update right away ( by copying the contents of the \" first sandbox \" over the appropriate section of your article ) ; or ( ) i still have some general reservations suggested detail changes minor word s mi thing typo corrections whatever ( in which case , i need to hear them asap so that i can address them ) . those are the only two viable courses of action . i need to get this stupid update done and get on with my life knowing that you will support it going forward once i 'm gone . i 'll stick around to see phase reach fulfillment with you , but that is all i want to spend my time here doing . and i do n't even wish to do that if you pro c ra stin ate much longer over phase so that it becomes yesterday 's news . i 'll simply write off my experience here as just a bad experience and move on . please stay focused . thanks . : ( ) - i agree . i 'll roll it out before i go to bed if i can , though it 's already am . : i assume that you did n't do the roll out last night because of the lat eness of the hour , and tonight because of the phase a scenario i suggested above . but from your response i realize that you are essen tually in concurrence with the phasing , understand what 's in the sandboxes , and are happy to roll out phase once i get back to you up above ( the ball is back in my court ) . so you can now go ahead and delete the above italicized paragraphs as far as i 'm concerned . talk i 'm quite happy to archive text that is well written and has possible future use as an useful reference to what transpired in reaching a local concurrence - as i did in archiving my original proposal over to my sandbox account ( where btw i 'm still keeping it \" current \" as you can see by my signed time stamped changes to it since i moved it over there ) - but i think that text along the lines of . comment : \" i think that word should be in bold . \" response : \" yes , i agree and i 've now fixed it . \" . might be approaching the level of being way too anal . once we know we 've reached agreement such text can be simply deleted . please specifically state here that you concur with my statement or expound further under it on how i might have missed your point or could still go further to satisfy it . once i read your specific concurrence i will delete the italicized text , otherwise it should remain in place until such concurrence is finally achieved . thanks . i deleted the indicated text ( to which the above paragraph originally referred ) as agreed by your concurrence , but un - indented ( den ted ? ) the above meta - text and left it in place ( but with some mods . to it as shown in bold ) for at least one more go - around because i wanted to modify this process a little as follows . it is probably simpler in cases where one of us ital ici zes text and ap pen ds a comment requesting concurrence on its removal , if the other person shows his concurrence by simply doing the requested deletion . if he does n't concur with its removal then he should post a response stating so , even if he has to qualify his reason for its remaining in place with a \" i do n't have the time right now to fully address why i want it to remain , but will do as soon as i can get to it \" type statement . i just want this to be a background \" clutter and garbage removal \" process , and not a means for one of us to achieve the other 's concurrence over something by twisting his arm with threats of deletion ( by , for instance , claiming he 's achieved a \" two hour consensus \" on the issue ! ) or even worse , by sur rep titious deletion while the other person is n't looking . ( talk : also it was seem convenient , interesting and encyclopedic to perhaps provide a small summary of the amount of players satisfying each condition perhaps ? i . e . \" the squad for this season contains : foreign players ; academy graduates ; home - grown players ; under - s \" ( yes i made those figures up ) . in this example you could fe asi bly allow players to be double - counted - that is to say , if they are home - grown and an academy graduate you could count them for both statistics ( or not , if you disagree ) which would make an explanation that ' certain statuses super cede other statuses but do not remove them entirely ' more necessary and yet more understandable , perhaps . : wrt your \" yes i made those figures up \" comment above , after seeing the arguments you 've presented to me re the \" vu oso issue \" i 'm tempted to reply to you , \" that 's ok , you appear to enjoy making the squad up every season too , so why stop there ? ! \" ) : seriously though , i can not write such a section until i know what the official mcfc first team squad for this upcoming season is ( and i do n't mean the uefa and epl registered squads ; i mean the \" first team squad \" pool from which those squads will in turn be selected ) . so i wo n't be in a position to write that section as long as you and i have to wave our arms about and admit that determining the mcfc first team squad is \" more art than science \" . another of the reasons i can not write anything is because somebody called p wi mag eg low edited the main mcfc article on aug in order to put adam clayton out on loan when he was n't even showing as being in the first team squad in the first place . presumably it was clayton 's lack of inclusion in the first team squad in that article that caused you to agree with my reasoning [ external link : here ] to remove him from the pst a week earlier . : so what i want to know is where were the nigel de jong styled editors to revert that un ci table edit when we really needed them ? as i say , you guys continually come across as a cl u ster fuck that spends almost all its time trying to nail jello to the wall and justifying your edit and reversion decisions by shooting from the hip . i 'm not going to spend my precious time writing something ( such as you suggested above ) only to have it immediately reverted as being inconsistent with the main mcfc article and not citing a source ( because there is no way i could cite support for adam clayton either being in the first team squad or not ) . to even attempt to that would be a lose - lose situation for me . and knowing my luck , i would probably get hit with another admin . warning to boot ! as the expression goes . once bitten , twice shy . : the above paragraph was probably written mostly in frustration at seeing someone put clayton out on loan over in the main mcfc article without first checking to see if he was even a first team squad member . this frustration was then compounded when gonads added a citation to support that person 's num b sk ul l ery ! ( you can delete the above italicized paragraph but only after you first remove clayton ( period ) from the first team squad over in the main article ) . talk : i have to ask - does this table provide any way of indicating that a player might have made the - man squad for one selection and then been removed later ? what happens if a player with appearances in all competitions ( except the fa cup for obvious reasons ) is sold in january , par exemple ? : this is an interesting point and my intuition tells me that this question may also be linked to the vu oso issue , meaning that the right answer ( whatever it is ) will may depend on what we determine the pst is meant to be . i need to think about whether the question you have just raised is the tip of an iceberg or not . whatever my response i sense that this is an issue that may require its own discussion section below rather than be buried here heavily nested amongst all these other points , most of which are going to reach closure here . so look for my response below when it eventually comes . : i have created a [ external link : new section ] below to present my answer to your question . this is not a straightforward issue . or perhaps more accurately , this issue can become as straightforward or as complex as you wish to make it . btw , since i moved a copy of the text of your initial question above to start off the new section , i believe this bold paragraph and the two italicized ones above it can now be deleted by you if you concur . : while i think about it , i take it that your asterisk - ing of kolarov 's number is because it 's not been officially announced ? just curious . that 's about all the observations for now , by the way . overall i actually really do like it . hope that gives you some food for thought , though ? : yes . the philosophy of my handling of kolarov 's shirt number is actually explained in bullet ( ) back up in the original \" suggestions for how to improve the pst \" proposal section . ( note : i have now archived this text to the user page of my \" sandbox account \" as i 've documented in that section above . ) i significantly reworked the paragraph starting \" a strawman for . \" ( most of which text is bullets ) with my last batch of edits earlier today . i even went back and added my signature ( my old wi mpy signature , not my flashy new one ) to the end of those bullets in the hope that it would help you better notice the changes to that block of text , and thus cause you to re - read them . i have now ( as part of this edit ) just overwritten my old wi mpy signature with my new super - dup er glow - in - the - dark new one . hopefully you will be able to see it this time around ! ) : another part of the problem here might be that the asterisk legend is footnoted at the base of the pst in my sandbox but i think the editor parser interprets the asterisk in my text as the beginning of a bullet and it substitutes a larger bullet icon for it . unfortunately , i did n't know what symbol to pre pen d to the asterisk to tell the parser to leave it be and just display the asterisk as is , and unfortunately i did n't have any time to mess around with such a pi ddly detail . if you know how to fix that , or if you can think of better symbols to use for what i 'm trying to achieve , then please make those edits to my sandbox and fix it for me . also , while you are it , if you know how to get the two footnoted source citations side by side on the same line please fix that for me too ( because i do n't know what parameters the \" fb \" macro template ( or whatever it is ) is capable of accepting . i tried using \" s \" and \" s \" but that did n't work . unless , of course , you prefer to see those global sources listed one per line . in which case we are in good shape . : i will respond to your other points once i 've got an answer for you , either implemented in my sandbox or a textual answer posted back here ( or perhaps both ) . i just wanted to answer take care of these issues first . : yesterday , i completed all my remaining outstanding responses to you wrt all your points raised above . i now need to see some indication that we have reached closure on them ( i can not just assume it - you have to specifically tell me ! ) or a verb alization of why your raised point might still be an issue , or even a statement of any new issues that might have occurred to you since . please work towards reaching closure on any point either of us has raised and specifically indicate it when you believe we have achieved such closure ( as i tried to demonstrate to you how to do in the sections that you archived ) . especially any issue that pertains to publication of phase ( see comments above ) . i consider phase to be ongoing , yet i still do n't want to spend the rest of my life bringing it to f ru ition . i did n't expect this \" discussion \" to go on as long as it has and i do n't have as much time to \" phi los op hi ze \" over this as you seem to have . i just want it done or rejected . your prior comments indicate you quite like it , so let 's do what it takes to get it to a quality level where it can be implemented asap . because of lack of timely feedback from you i have now lost much \" available wikipedia \" time this weekend that could have been put to more productive use improving the update . thanks . : the one outstanding comment i have about all this is the one i raised elsewhere : what about the fact that uefa squad registration does not operate on the pl principles of under - , hgp , academy gp , foreign . if we can decide what to do about that then i 'm sold . : ' i 'm adding this text in bold font to make sure you see it . your point ( s ) above are well noted and i have written my approach to handling this issue in my response to your original comments \" elsewhere \" where you originally raised it - viz . in the \" suggestions for how to improve the pst \" section up above . i suggested either delaying phase a day or so , or going ahead and rolling out phase and i 'll fix the codes in a phase a update ( if it 's ne cess a ey to do so ) . i have n't decided which to do yet ( as i write this ) but look for my later response recommendation up above in that section when i have made up my mind . now that you 've read this paragraph you can consider it italicized and remove it with all the other italicized text . gosh , this feels like mission impossible . this ness age will self - de str uc t in seconds ! ) talk : incidentally , i just fixed the two technical problems you cited in the sandbox . if you are n't happy with either solution , tell me and i 'll find a different way of doing it . : no it was just fine and dandy and achieved exactly what i wanted to achieve . i also now know about the \" nowiki \" control codes . i should have thought of that myself . i have copied your updates over to the phas ec sandbox to keep the two versions consistent . old need um has also been removed from both sandbox psts since he now belongs to steve bruce for the duration . this text , plus all the italicized text above , can now be deleted as far as i 'm concerned . talk the pst squad status information going forward finally , let me address the issue of what you might wish to do once mancini registers his - man squads with both the epl ( at the end of this month for the first half of the upcoming season ) and uefa ( i 'm not quite sure when exactly the europa league registration deadline is , but i 'm assuming it is probably the same date ) . if my understanding of the two squad registration requirements is correct ( step ) , and my understanding of the various players ' ages and youth backgrounds is also correct ( step ) , and my application of the two sets of requirements to all the players currently listed in the latest version of the pst ( step ) is also correct , then the above status codes are actually quite objective pieces of information ( i wo n't go so far as to say \" un contentious \" because as we all saw with my recent go - around with gonads , there are times and situations where even the information he is now defending from change was , only a few days ago , quite contentious ) . my assigned squad stat i merely classifies all the current first team squad players into four useful pools , and it does not try to second guess mancini 's ultimate - man \" epl squad \" and - man \" uefa squad \" selections ( should they differ ) . however , after both those - man squads are announced you could possibly then modify the above stat i to suitably reflect which competitions the various players are eligible to participate in ( which is the whole pur po ose of this classification process ) . how that is best done is a topic of discussion for another day . because the wisdom of going beyond what i 've already done in \" step \" above is something that needs some careful thought . if you did decide to go in that direction , the \" squad status \" information would change twice per season since the both squads have to be registered at the end of every transfer window ( thus allowing newly acquired and lo aned - in players to be added , and newly sold and lo aned - out players to be removed from the prior registration ) which would create a similar situation as exists for the new squad numbers every pre season . and that might create simply way too much editing contention\n",

      "this is all \" christians think women are inferior property \" . does anyone think they can npov it , or that the subject is cohesive enough for a single article ? : , sep ( utc ) : good grief this bad . i do n't think you can cover what the title suggests needs to be covered in this article . i think some of it can be moved to something like [ wiki link : biblical references to the treatment of women ] where facts and not value judgments can be placed . then , the subject of modern christian views of women can be inserted in many articles that describe each denomination or movement within christianity . there about a zillion and you ca n't lump their views into a single encompassing article . : , sep ( utc ) : gosh , i thought it was primarily muslims , hindus and east asians who thought women are inferior to men , or that they might be considered \" property \" . it had n't occured to me that there were any christians left who still thought that way , particularly in post - feminist america ( at least , not living on the \" upper west side \" of manhattan ) . i 'll take a look , but i do n't promise quick results . : , sep ( utc ) : in my old church the women ruled with an iron hand . i 'm not sure you are going to be able to encompass all the different \" christian views of women \" in an article less than pages long . good luck . : , sep ( utc ) : [ wiki link : andrew wilson ] , another uts professor , writes : \" the equality of all persons , male and female , rich and poor , of any race , class , or caste , is proclaimed in the scriptures of all faiths . this is true despite the conventions of many cultures that discriminate between people on the basis of caste , or class , or race , or sex . regrettably , such discrimination is also on occasion supported by certain conventional interpretations of passages from sacred texts . \" : ed , the article header says christianity , in all its variations , relies on the bible as a guide . therefore , the biblical perspective of women is the christian perspective of women . the following quotations are from the bible . and does not indicate that there are many differing interpretations of the verses listed which leaves the reader to assume a default interpretation . for example , the interpretation of the verse about submitting to the authority of the man is also influenced by so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies . some churches are hard line and lean toward the supremacy of the former while some churches think that you can not view the verses as being separated at all . some caveat about the varied interpretations of these verses and the vast differences in christian practice needs to be included if the article is going to remain under a single title . i just wonder if the article is about actual christian practice or hard line interpretation . thanks : , sep ( utc ) : i 'm not a christian nor particulary prone to agreeing with christian views , and even i see this article as horribly biased . this is a selection of snippets from the bible that ' prove ' that it has an anti - woman bias ; however , the bible is way too self - contradictory for those to be the only views stated in the entire work . plus , most modern christians do not believe all of the old testament to be binding , i believe . to be even remotely npov this article needs a representative sample of biblical quotes , not a specially selected bunch ; and it needs explanation , with quotes by preference , as to what the beliefs of modern christians are . which are , of course , highly varied . : , sep ( utc ) lets make [ wiki link : old te st am en tical views of women ] and [ wiki link : new te st am en tical views of women ] because they are smaller topics - > more detail - > less room for pov - > better articles . then [ wiki link : biblical views of women ] and then there is still way much more to cover before christian views of women can be a good article . imho : , sep ( utc ) : i can dig that . but i would say [ wiki link : modern christian views of women ] rather than [ wiki link : biblical views of women ] which would have been covered in the other two . or as an alternative , the modern views could be included in the various articles about the denominations . : , sep ( utc ) : ark , about the biblical perspective in more than years of dealing with christian ev ange lists , i 've found nothing more common than this : the assumption that what the individual evangelist is trying to convince me of is not his church 's interpretation of the bible but what the bible says . these guys are too stubborn and or ignorant to concede that they are interpreting the bible , which really used to piss me off . nowadays , i take it in stri de ( usually ) , but i had many a lively debate in my youth , let me tell you ! : that 's one reason i like wikipedia so much . it 's a given that whatever you or i think is our \" pov \" and no one can get away with pal ming off their own ideas as common knowledge or \" the obvious truth \" . ( okay , except maybe in that tiny minority of really controversial subjects like the [ wiki link : arab - israeli conflict ] . ) : anyway , let 's try to identify a few of the major themes in christian thought about the role of women , which is ( i think ) vicki 's original request : which christians regard women as inferior , and why ? also , which do n't ? a related but tricky question is whether men and women can have different roles but yet have equal value , which is the official view of my church but is controversial even amongst us lai ety . is sub or din ation necessarily abusive ? is equality rebellious ? all sorts of deli ciously contentious questions spring to mind ! : , sep ( utc ) : to illustrate , in my denomination ( i am not an at ten der any more ) there was a policy of not keeping ministers around permanently . they came and then were reas signed after a few years . but an \" associate pastor \" was not restricted in this way and were usually a member of the local congregation . the associate pastor at our church was a very strong woman . she was the associate pastor for almost years . where do you think the power was in that church ? the minister who would stay years or the associate pastor who had been there for decades and knew everything about the inner workings ? the minister was essentially the sermon producer , the associate pastor , well , she managed and ran the place like a swiss watch . : , sep ( utc ) all right , after typing away for straight minutes , i hope i have fulfilled vicki 's request in part . much more remains to be done , of course . any other christians want to help ? : , sep ( utc ) : oh . just realised all edits you 've done . seems like you have made in a better way what i was trying to do in [ wiki link : old testament views of women ] . but i still maintain that the subject is to broad . i know what i think about women but i honestly have no idea what christians in general think about women . and also , all quotes from the old testament are ofcourse as much jewish and muslim views as they are christian . : , sep ( utc ) is it really possible to discuss christian views of women without mentioning the virgin mary ? : , sep ( utc ) i got email from someone who identified himself as the creator of this page , and asking for my reasons for listing it . it sounded as though he wanted me to provide biblical texts opposing his , which i 'm not prepared to do . i sent him an email including \" that statement [ that all christian viewpoints are based on the bible ] is false in terms of what many christians actually believe and practice . also , selective quoting can be used to slant any number of things . \" and inviting him to come here for discussion . : , sep ( utc ) i am the author of the original text of ' christian views of women . ' here are some comments on the dialogue so far . ( ) if anyone can provide me an instance of a christian individual or organization at any time in history that does not ( does not ) base its beliefs on the bible , i would be pleased to learn of it . ( ) no argument about old testament vs . new testament is valid here , because as stated in the original text and remaining there still jesus christ confirms , twice , that ' the old laws ' are valid eternally . ( ) if there are quotations from the bible that offer a different view of women than the ones i listed then i would be pleased to read them . i 'll have to be a stic kler for detail here : you ca n't just point out views on people in general . if anyone thinks the bible says anything different than what i quoted about or for women , specifically women , then let me know . i 've pointed out a representative sample of what i know the bible says about women , but maybe others know about parts i have missed so far . ( ) that my entry has generated interest is a point of pride . that the first and most active responce has been an effort to delete my entry has been a disappointment . quotations from the bible are anti - christian ? that seems strange to me . i have admitted error many times before but i appreciate all the practice i can get . also , i 'm relatively new to wikipedia : please be patient with my wiki skills . september : thanks for bringing the discussion here . to answer your questions : ( ) many christian groups base their views on both the bible and other things for example , catholic theology and practice are also based on other writings , church councils , and papal statements . ( for example , and for obvious reasons , there 's nothing explicitly in the bible about hor mon al cont rac eption . ) furthermore , a lot can be lost , or added , in translation . how are your hebrew and greek ? the king james translation reflects the views of j ac o bean england . ( ) in practice , most people pick and choose among the old law sthey observe the sabbath on a different day , they eat pork and shellfish , they mix different f ab ri cs . ( ) how about proverbs : * \" rejoice with the wife of thy youth . let her breasts satisfy thee at all times ; and be thou rav ished always with her love . \" ( ) quoting bits of the bible to support the claim that christians , or christianity , look down on women is anti - christian . : also , this is just too large a subject . a good article might be written on , say , southern baptist views on the role of women . an article on sha ker views of women would be very different : the united society of believers in christ 's second appearing believed that a woman was the messiah . roman catholicism 's position is different from either . : thank you for your reply . ( ) and ( ) if the majority of christians do not follow the bible word - for - word and literally ( i agree this is the case ) , why do they not change the bible ? because christians believe the bible is the inf ali able word of god . whether they follow the bible or not is another issue : that the bible says what i said it says , that i quoted it accurately , neutrally and in - context is true . ( ) an excellent find and most worthy of adding to the page . i do hope you will add this quotation ! ( ) i may be misunderstanding you , and if so my apologies . are you suggesting i did not select representative selections of the bible 's view on women ? if so , please show me as many or more quotes that are in contradiction to the ones i offered . the quotations i listed are consistant and cover large sections of the bible . so far one ( ) quotation in contradiction to the initial quotes has surfaced . so . what is the non - neutral perspective here ? what perspective has empirical evidence on its side , and what perspective is bol stered by unattributed quotations from outside the source ? ( lar gen ess of subject ) i 'd say yes and no . christian interpretation application of the bible is large and diverse , but the bible itself is not . if christianity is based on the bible , any christian group or individual must say which verses they do and do not uphold . if christians do not support the bible as it stands , they should change the bible . having had a few thousand years to change the bible ( in part and as a whole ) and having chosen not to do so , i maintain that the statement christians base their faith on the bible is accurate and neutral . : the bible states rabbits are ' unclean ' because they chew cud ( leviticus : , deuteronomy : - ) . whether or not they are ' unclean , ' empirical evidence can not say ( ' clean liness ' and ' un clean liness ' being supernatural qualities ) . but whether or not rabbits chew cud can be confirmed or denied by empirical evidence . do rabbits chew cud ? any kind of rabbit ? now or in the past ? the answer is no . no rabbits chew cud , not now , not in the past , not any kind of rabbit . this is a very small error in the bible . who knows why some anonymous author thousands of years ago had that odd idea , or why it mattered . changing it would not lessen the bible in any way . but has this falsehood been corrected in the past few thousand years ? it has not . why ? because ( again ) christians view the bible as inf ali able and accurate . to change any one thing would question the whole thing . my point is this : christians keep the bible as it is because while they may say they do n't follow this or that part of it , they ( deep inside ) believe they should follow all of it . my proof is that the bible does not change , no matter how at odds it is with empirical evidence or contemporary morality . if the bible is mistaken , why is it not corrected ? if christianity is not based on the bible , what is it based on ? rabbits chewing cud ; who cares . women are cattle ( or women are worthy of love , as you have pointed out ) ; rather more important . if christians and their bible have claims about women they should not hide them ( and this entry should not be deleted ) . : but . perhaps if this entry were titled \" biblical views of women \" it would be a more man ag able beast . that way , christian x vs . christian y views would be omitted in favor of straight - up genesis to revelation quotations from the source . i maintain my initial post was neutral . i welcome improvements upon it , including those that may contradict my initial offerings ( and again - please do add the quote you have found ! ) . * and dont forget the parable of the mustard seed , the one that does n't grow up to be a tree . despite all but one non - anon vote to delete this , i am moving the vfd debate here as there seems to be discussion still underway on this page . * [ wiki link : christian views of women ] incredibly pov and anti - christian . also probably tries to cram too much under one topic . if someone wanted to fix this , a plausible approach might be to write a very general intro , and then links to articles on the views of different christian groups . : , sep ( utc ) * vote again t deleting . if the article is pov 'd , then it should be listed under pages that need attention . : , sep ( utc ) * delete . again , this and \" marriage in the eyes of god \" ( as an article ) are incredibly hard to justify given npov guidelines . * as it stands i say delete . but i reserve final judgment until i see what ed poor comes up with . : , sep ( utc ) * yes , delete ca n't imagine this becoming npov , and do n't see it adding any substance to wikipedia . also , this page seems to be in the same vein , but maybe it 's a start on a fix : [ wiki link : old te st am en tical views of women ] . : , sep ( utc ) * if it 's not fixed to something reasonably npov within the seven days , delete it . : , sep ( utc ) * most of this is a factual quoting of old testament text , cited verbatim . as far as pov in articles goes , i 've seen much worse . however , it is still one - sided ( in terms of not showing us the whole picture about what the bible says , in both te st am ents and various books ) . if we make the article into a thorough examination of the bible 's statements on women , keep . : , sep ( utc ) * vote against deletion . initial post had brief , neutral statement ( ' the following are quotes from the bible ' ) followed by quotes from the bible . consider the implications if accurate quotes from the bible are inherently un - neutral at wikipedia . ( i cast this vote before i know how to log in , cast a vote , etc . - please consider it a non - anonymous vote ) * subject deserves an article , and the current one has good bits , although most is pov . maybe we should just cut out the extraneous and start again . vote against . : , sep ( utc ) * unusable title . for any given idea , principle , whatever , there at least two christians who hold different positions . there is no christian view on anything . ( except that which is a matter of definition : \" christ was , is , and or will be . \" ) : , sep ( utc ) * i got email from the page creator this morning , asking my reasons and for counter - quo tes he also seems to feel that selected bible quotes are inherently npov . i pointed out the problems of selection , and asked him to come here or to the article 's talk page to discuss the matter . : , sep ( utc ) * delete , definitely delete . as an atheist , i share many of the views of the page 's creator , at least in how the bible itself depicts the proper treatment of women . however , to suggest that modern christians as a whole group interpret those verses in the same way is ludicrous . his is certainly one take on the bible , but it is not shared by all . any page that suggests that all christian groups are in agreement on any point of biblical interpretation should be deleted because it simply is n't true . unless the page is going to be altered ( quickly and substantially ) to include quotes links from various modern christian groups discussing their views on the \" proper \" biblical depiction of women , the page should be deleted . : , oct . * delete , my comments are near the bo tom of this page . * vote against deletion . while many people have \" belief \" systems that find it hard to justify their system 's document of record wikipedia should be above forging its pages from systems with historic track records for twisting facts to more closely reflect those \" belief \" systems . if wikipedia wants to stay above the fray we all need to write and value our pages not from dogma or the ages old rule of belief systems but from fact , intelligence and knowledge . * \" despite all but one non - anon vote to delete this . \" one ? i see three non - anonymous people saying not to delete : ta ku , wi wa xia , and dj clay worth . * sorry , i misread dj clay worth 's comment . wi wa xia seemed to be supporting deletion unless the article was changed , so i did n't that vote in the against category . i should have said one non - anon supporting outright deletion . actually , i should have said - including dj . sorry for the error . question for ta ku , wi wa xia , dj clay worth : do you believe this is really the proper title for the article ? i 'm in favor of ar kin f 's suggestion of [ wiki link : old te st am en tical views of women ] , [ wiki link : new te st am en tical views of women ] , and a [ wiki link : biblical views of women ] . though the word ' te st am en tical ' kind of pains me . i 'd say that this page should perhaps contain the first paragraph , and link to those three articles . * if you 're moving the content , then \" christian views of women \" can be kept as a redirect ( although to which of the three it would direct , i 'm not sure . ) : i actually prefer this title . firstly because i think more people will find it they will naturally search for ' christian ' rather than ' new testament ' ; secondly because christian views actually differ from new testament views . in the latter case this is because ( a ) some christians have views on women that are hard to find justification for in the new testament ( i 'm ashamed to admit ) ; ( b ) the catholic traditions about mary the mother of jesus should be discussed , although they have little foundation in the new testament ( c ) some of the things said about women in the nt were clearly said in a st century context , and the specific practices of the time are not ( generally ) the same as today 's . : however there is certainly space for ' old testament view . ' ( where it is different from jewish view . ) and possibly ' new testament view . ' as well . : also to add the ' new testament view . ' is better than ' new te st am en tical view . ' . short is better than long , and there is already an adjective from testament - \" te st am ental \" . question : where are the supporting facts and instances to prove this page needs removal ? so far there has been a lot of personal reasons but as far as factual counter points there have been very little . to delete this page outright is to admit wikipedia is simply a collection of subjective viewpoints and not supported by factual under pin nings . which would be more damning , bible su por ters to be asked to show supporting facts for thier removal calls or for wikipedia 's factual article be ruled by the same mind sets that brought us the in qu is tion , g ali le os little problems , and a rich history of fact re vis on . : arguments have already been ad duc ed : primarily that while this might be a plausible selection of biblical quotes on the subject , it does n't begin to serve as a complete or accurate description of the teachings or beliefs of any christian group , let alone all of them . its claim to be so is misleading and thus un - encyclopedic . ( as a side note , i 'm amused to be classed as a \" bible supporter \" . ) : i think all the old testament quotes and discussion can be replaced with a link to [ wiki link : old testament views of women ] . what 's important for an article with this title is what christians actually think , not which the religious texts that they largely ignore or re interpret to pieces tell them to think . : exactly the right question . if the bible is the in errant word of god , then these quotations direct from the kjv , with full context , must necessarily represent the beliefs of those who agree with that contention . to pick and choose among scripture so that only the nice parts are revealed is at best a revisionist approach to describing christian beliefs and is certainly a disservice to those who believe ( as many claim to ) , that the bible is the in errant word of god . : no . the kjv does not represent the beliefs of all who ' agree with that contention ' . there are other bibles that people use besides that one . : , sep ( utc ) : context is important . more important is that we 're writing an encyclopedia , not religious tracts . i could write a page on \" christian views of food \" , quoting leviticus at length in order to \" prove \" that christians believe that it is wrong to eat pork , shrimp , or cat fish . relatively few christians actually believe this , however . the goal of wikipedia , in discussing religion , is to describe what people actually believe , not to prove that they ought to believe something else . vicki rosen z wei g wrote : \" the goal of wikipedia , in discussing religion , is to describe what people actually believe , not to prove that they ought to believe something else . \" i agree . that is why i have never once said it was ' right ' or ' wrong ' that christians make certain statements . i quoted the source and let the quotes speak for themselves . others have gone on at length about how ' wrong ' those statements are , but that they can be made ' right ' if understood in context . my neutral point of view ? voted for deletion . others ' non - neutral point of view ? discussed at length and sp aw ning several new entries . evidence supporting the claim my original post was not neutral ? lacking . bluster and ' you know ' and good intentions and votes for deletion ? plenty . so while i would agree that the goal of wikipedia regarding religion is neutrality , so far i have n't seen that neutrality . : pst october\n",

      "user asked me to review this article . i 'll add comments below as i go through ; i 'm reviewing with an eye to [ wiki link : wp : fac ] , which means being fairly picky . * i do n't think you need to repeat \" sledd \" at the start of the second sentence ; the reader can be pretty confident about the referent of \" he \" this early in the article . how about \" a native of virginia , he \" ? : i like to repeat the use of the surname at least once in the lead , but i can live with a little less repetition . : i agree ; it varies the rhythm a little bit to go back and forth between \" he \" and \" sledd \" , but i think it 's ok to wait another sentence or two here . ) * \" he later earned a second master 's and doctorate degrees \" : i think \" doctorate degrees \" is imprecise ; either \" a doctorate degree \" , if it 's just one , or give the number if there are two or more . : agreed . * a little [ wiki link : wp : overlink overlinking ] in the lead : you certainly do n't need the usa to be linked , and i think professor is arguable . i would also unlink \" biblical \" , \" minister \" , \" magazine \" and \" literature \" . : agreed . * the second paragraph of the lead does n't give the events in chronological order i think it would be easier on the reader to make it chronological , and avoid \" he previously served \" . : rewrote sentence to clarify chronology . * it 's a pity that three of the institutions in that paragraph require either \" formerly known as \" or \" now known as \" ; it 's quite a distraction to the reader . i think the first should be left as is , since that 's a fairly important one , but could you just have \" southern university \" link directly to [ wiki link : birmingham southern college ] ( perhaps to the history section ) and just drop the second one completely , leaving the clarification to the body of the article ? actually since you say \" formerly known \" it 's not clear to me whether that name was in use when he was there ; if it was n't it 's certainly unnecessary . : agreed . will rely on body text for further explanation . : that 's certainly improved , but now you have \" first \" twice in quick succession . per the u of f article , it seems that it was called by the prior name while he was there , so i think \" then known \" , as you originally had it , is ok the history is quite complicated , it appears , and \" first known \" is even slightly misleading as there were precursor institutions . ) * the infobox could also drop some links ; again , professor probably should n't be linked . the current link to [ wiki link : me tho dism ] is from \" methodist minister \" ; probably better to link just from \" methodist \" . the \" university president \" is ok but you have it in the lead so it may not be necessary here my usual practice is to link once in the lead and once again in the body , but that 's my habit and not any kind of rule . * first para of body : how about a comma after \" virginia methodist conference \" to avoid the reader taking the next clause as also governed by \" the elder sledd was \" ? : agreed . * same sentence : it took me a second to work out that all three towns were in virginia . how about : \" dan ville , norfolk and petersburg , in [ or \" all in \" ] virginia . \" ? : rewrote sentence to clarify that all three cities are located in virginia . : that works well . ) * i know little about the history of protestant groups in the us , and was surprised to see \" methodist episcopal \" ; i thought they were two separate groups . the link is to [ wiki link : me tho dism ] ( already linked by this time , so perhaps not needed ) , but i had to search that article to discover that there was a split in me tho dism in and one group called itself the \" methodist episcopal \" church . is there perhaps a more specific link that would be helpful here ? : you are correct , sir . ep is cop ali ans are the direct organizational and doctrinal descendants of the church of england . the methodist episcopal church , and its african - american sister church , the african methodist episcopal ( a . k . a . \" a . m . e . \" ) church were methodist groups . there was a civil war era schism in the white m . e . church that was later patched up in the th century , and the \" episcopal \" portion of the national methodist church name was dropped . the a . m . e . church continues to exist and use that name . fyi , the \" episcopal \" in the m . e . name refers to the church 's hierarchical structure which relies on bishops as regional administrators , not to the american episcopal church . two different flavors of american protestants . : i think my confusion was as to whether a \" methodist episcopal \" minister was the same thing as a methodist minister , or if it implied something different . does that branch of the church still refer to itself by that name ? or is it not in fact a branch , but the main methodist church , using a variant but perhaps still current form of the name ? i ca n't be sure if this is something that would bother readers so you may want to get another opinion , but i 've never heard \" methodist episcopal \" before , and if it would be just as accurate to replace it with \" methodist \" it would be an improvement . as i say , you might want to seek another opinion on this one . ) * i just noticed \" prominence \" and \" prominently \" too close to each other in the lead ; perhaps you could cut the latter , since it 's just an in ten si fier . * i see some more overlinking e . g . \" baseball \" , \" principal \" , \" hitter \" , \" high school \" and \" degree \" . could you take a pass through the whole article ? there 's certainly debate at the boundaries but there are definitely too many at the moment . * does the source give any information about why he quit teaching in ark adel phia to finish his degree ? seems like an unusual sequence of events ; did he need money from the job to finish ? was he unsuccessful or unhappy there ? no problem if the source does n't cover it , but this is an article about the man as well as the career and his motivations are interesting to the reader . * i just had a quick look via google books to see if there were any other possibly relevant sources , and found emory college and the sledd affair of : a case study in southern honor and racial attitudes by ralph reed is that something you could use ? i also found ( in a book called spam kings , about porn ! ) a more detailed description of the lyn ching and some quotes from sledd 's article ; i think you could expand your description of the affair a bit ( not using spam kings ! ) , perhaps quoting sledd 's article a little . and how about adding sledd 's atlantic monthly article to the bibliography ? * not sure about this one , but see what you think . the end of the early life and education section mentions his ph . d . , which is reasonable , but of course that means that you have to jump forward several years and then immediately back to emory college for the next section . how about eliminating any mention of the latin teaching at the end of the early life section , and simply saying , \" he did not complete the doctorate he started at harvard , but earned his ph . d . from yale , several years later , during a break in his teaching career . \" that could probably be improved , but it se gre gates the material a little . does that work ? * \" after re signing from the emory faculty , sledd completed his doctorate in nine months at yale university in , [ ] and obtained an appointment as a professor of greek at southern university \" : as with the teaching post in ark adel phia , it would be nice if the sources give any more details on this was he unable to get a job immediately , and so went back to his interrupted studies , or did he view the interruption as an opportunity to complete the degree ? again , no problem if the sources are n't specific . * i think a little more detail is needed for the u of f at lake city story , or perhaps just more explicit connections between the dots . it seems that the faculty was academically very weak , and that 's why the board of trustees removed them ? can we come out and say that , in that case ? and presumably sledd was selected with the intention of raising academic standards ? was it because sledd had been recently dismissed that he agreed to take a rather difficult and seemingly un distinguished position ? * \" although the university was a land - grant college under the mor rill act , its finances remained tenuous . \" i think this needs a couple of parenthetical words of explanation ; without following the links a reader has no idea why a land - grant college would be expected to have robust finances . and is \" tenuous \" the right word ? do you mean insecure , or insufficient , or at risk , or that they over spent their budget ? * my preference would be \" to \" rather than \" \" . * the phrase \" the new university of the state of florida \" finishes two consecutive sentences . * first para of that section does n't actually say that bro ward backed sledd as president of the new institution ; it says bro ward backed him politically , then they passed an act to consolidate the universities and colleges , and then there 's the vote to place it at gainesville . the reader does n't yet know sledd expected to be president , so the next paragraph is a bit of a surprise . * \" mur ph ree continued to serve \" : i do n't think you want \" continued \" he remained president , but of a different institution . * you have \" new gainesville campus \" , \" new campus \" , and \" new gainesville campus \" in a single paragraph ; i 'd at least cut the last \" new \" . * the caption for buck man hall seems too long the whole second sentence is information that the reader can find in the adjacent text . how about just \" buck man hall , where sledd lived from to \" ? * \" sledd 's role was instrumental \" : i think you mean sledd was instrumental , rather than the role . * last para of the u of the s of f section ; i would suggest re ji gging to get the parenthetical remark earlier , so that the reader understands the power of the board to remove sledd prior to mentioning that it wished to do so . * \" within several weeks \" : \" a few weeks \" would be more natural to my ear , but that might be just because it 's an english ear . * \" a position he held for the balance of until the summer of \" : \" for the balance of \" means \" until the end of \" , so i think this needs rephrasing , since he stayed beyond that . perhaps \" and through the summer of \" , or \" for the remainder of and the first half of \" . * \" he further developed his personal and professional reputation for financial pro bi ty and academic rigor by restoring the school 's finances and improving the quality of its instruction \" : this sounds a bit less than neutral . i 'd either cut the approving phrases , or else make it something like \" he restored the school 's finances and improved the quality of its instruction , giving him a reputation among x for financial pro bi ty and academic rigor \" , where x is the group among whom the source indicates he has that reputation . it 's not that i doubt that he has this reputation , but i think it 's a good idea to ascribe interpretations to a source historian , biographer , or whoever . given that this source is from the c and ler school of theology , it seems unlikely to be completely neutral . * i was distracted by the c and ler school , because of the coincidence of names , and of course when i looked it up i found it was named after sledd 's wife 's uncle . i think it would be worth mentioning this at the first mention of the c and ler school , just to avoid the reader wondering about it . * \" sledd returned to the renamed emory university \" : renamed from emory college ; but the reader wo n't remember that . well , i did n't , anyway ; i had to go back and see what the name had been . how about \" sledd returned to emory college , now renamed emory university \" ? * i 'm confused about the sequence at this point you have consecutive sentences saying : \" in , sledd left the small methodist university to accept a profess orship at the methodist episcopal church , south 's new seminary in atlanta , the c and ler school of theology . in , sledd returned to the renamed emory university , by then relocated to its new main campus in northeast atlanta , as the first professor of greek and new testament literature at the newly established c and ler school of theology . \" separated by a section heading . was it at south 's seminary or at emory ? and in any case , assuming these are n't inconsistent as they appear to be , the material should n't be repeated in this way . * \" sledd led a distinguished career \" : i do n't think one \" leads \" a career ; one leads a life , but one has a career . and \" distinguished \" worries me ; again the source is the c and ler school . can it be cut or do you feel it 's independently defensible\n",

[ wiki link : wikipedia : esperanza xd ] - [ wiki link : wikipedia : semi - protection policy did you read this ? ] ) i just edited the current info to say ' anticipated southward movement . ' there was no significant southward mov ment to the track for some hours after the am ( as of around noon cst z dec th ) , so the southward movement did n't start until then . to note : there were at least four track forecasts before the movement to the track was adjusted to the ese , where epsilon went to the south of the forecast points , sometimes not even making the first forecast point ( fairly unusual ) . but , as soon as they adjusted to the expected southward movement and turn to the sw , epsilon started moving pretty much due east , and the last two track forecasts have missed the other direction , as epsilon has moved to the north of the track points . this all points to the dependency on recon and drop son de information for accurate track forecasts . i bet what is really making everyone crazy at nhc t pc right now is the inability to send out even one recon , not just for the normal reasons , but for a chance to get some data to understand what is making epsilon go . is it still some kind of hybrid ? is there some kind of bar oc lin ic process going on , that can only occur in the colder environment ? is wind shear not affecting it mainly because convection is shallow , or is the outflow strong enough to deflect the wind shear ? why are the eye and eye wall so well - defined for such a weak tropical storm ? at least we know the wind estimates are not so far off because of the occasional qui k scat . : epsilon is definitely weakening now . on the satellite loop , you can see the southeastern portion of the eye breaking apart . epsilon looks like it 's ' going south ' rapidly . starting to tilt vertically and de couple from the wind shear , and the convection ero ded to the se again . i 'm convinced , now , in retrospect that it was still a hybrid system and receiving a shot of bar oc lin ic energy from the front that moved to the north , in some fashion , after re playing the nw atl loop from today and then looking at the flo ater . that would explain the intensity over the last three days . also . the slow down weakened it because of the cooler water . i was thinking previously that it was a shallow storm and that was why the shear was not affecting it ; now i think there is a possibility that it was not so shallow , and the outflow was fairly strong , enough to hold off the shear . also another possible explanation . epsilon is moving into an area with stronger winds at - mb level , rather than - mb , and if it was shallow , these strong winds at the lower level are now able to do what the higher shear could not . would appreciate any feedback on which might be more plausible . on the other hand it almost looks as if it is starting to rebuild that portion of the eye , there is now a large band of weak convection in the se portion of they eye , and that large band is starting to fire up a bit as of the latest image . who knows with epsilon , it might not be done yet after all . : , december ( utc ) i do n't have a clue now . it still looks de coupled a bit , but the convection did wrap back around and the outflow is back . it 's even looking less elongated . almost like one of those cartoon characters that takes a corner too sharply and the head keeps going the original direction , then rubber - bands back to the body . it turned the corner and the upper level circ almost did n't come along . the main convection does seem oddly cut off from the center now , though . well now it is more elongated but it does appear that the convection on the west might break away leaving a very small epsilon . it is really starting to struggle now . now the northern eye is starting to fade away . i was predicting it at tropical storm strength at this advisory , but now i think it might hold together until tomorrow yet . aww . poor ic kle epsilon . wait . it looks like it 's starting to recover that northern eye . the se p pr tion is almost normal , and his eye looks really o val ish . i would n't be suprised if he st reg th ened . we all know he 's tour ture . if we have another t . s , zeta , expect it to go through at the end of dec . and into jan . - hides under chair - : , december . just when i was tempted to reduce the intensity to kt . ep si lon started to again wrap some con vec tive bands of modest depth tight ly around the center . so it remains a - kt hurricane . knabb this time . maybe avila finally took a nap . i say forget \" poor ic kle epsilon \" and concentrate on poor ic kle li x ion avila , who seriously needs a hug and some hot cocoa . it seems like they may have traded times . knabb did the first overnight ( pm ) , avila covered the last overnight that knabb would normally have covered ( am ) , and then knabb came back for the am , which has been avila 's the last couple of days . i do n't know what the shift rotation is there . the \" small epsilon \" i wrote about last night did form , and is having a rough time today . dry air and shear is helping to break down the convection every time it re builds . the eye and central organization looked weak this morning but no on time the structure appears to have fir med up again , even with continued dry air en train ment breaking down the ring of convection around the eye . this is the first time however we have seen shear ripping the tops of convection off the center ring , in spite of the c im ss wind shear product reducing the shear the first time in days to below kts ( do n't trust that so much . always go by what you can see on sat images and use it in conjunction with that ) . still improving and i think they 'll leave it a hurricane at the pm . what is left of ep si lon is now forecast by nearly all the models to become involved in some way with a frontal zone in about three days . and the new official forecast follows suit . the front would be associated with an extratropical low pressure system forecast by all of the models to develop north of epsilon in about hours . i hesitate to mention that most of the models forecast this extratropical system . after absorbing epsilon . to sag back to the south of n on day to the west of the canary islands . i do n't know whether to laugh or cry . i imagine knabb and avila just holding each other while the world ends . the end is in sight . it really is . but in the meantime . epsilon continues to maintain hurricane status . i 'm laughing so hard , but feeling bad for doing it . poor fo rec asters . and this is franklin , not knabb or avila . : are they really sure about that ? he 's defying everything ! this is like a broken record . funny part of all this is that every nhc forecast has had demise of epsilon after hours for , oh , days straight , and it is still \" hours away \" . that said , i truly believe this time it is for real , it is going down , honest . i think that in a paradoxical way , entering warmer conditions may actually weaken the storm , because then it becomes more tropical and thus , more vulnerable to hostile conditions and it no longer has the extratropical processes which apparently kept it going against all odds . : when he said ' the end is in sight ' , he meant that epsilon 's dis sip ation is in sight , not the end of the world . - ' : dr . avila comes back from his nice rest only to see his colleague 's comment about the end , and then this : the end is in sight . yes . but not quite yet . i thought i was going to find a weakening system and instead i found that epsilon is still a hurricane . as it has done every morning . the con vec tion has re developed around the large and distinct eye . kicking the dv orak t - numbers back up again . all agencies support hur ri can e intensity . : poor dr . avila , he should permanently hand this storm to knabb or franklin . also , note this : i have no option but to forecast weakening at a fast pace . never there less . there is very little confidence in the in ten si ty forecast . : the nhc seem to think epsilon could out smart them again . ( [ wiki link : wp : cvu cvu ] ) okay . now i can say poor ic kle knabb and avila , as well as franklin . it seems to me that epsilon is holding a whip and whipping nhc . good news though , i looked at the sat te lite of epsilon , and the eye looks poorly defined . really bad oval look to it . i think it may finally be downgraded soon . : here i have to go against the nhc on this one . i actually think strengthening is in order . this time tomorrow , i think it will still be a hurricane , and a stronger one than it is now . in fact , i would n't be surprised if epsilon has not reached peak intensity yet . : aww . it looks like its falling apart . yeah the east part of the hurricane is falling apart , its being attacked by strong wind shear , as of rig th now . i say it 's still a hurricane as it still has an eye , but i only give it a couple more hours before the shear completely makes they eye collapse , and then rapid we aking will ( hopefully ) occur . it appears that the advisories and discussions are now being issued by the hydro meteorological prediction center . i 'm not sure what the significance of that is ; i thought the h pc usually reports on extratropical and non - tropical low pressure systems in the atlantic . is this because epsilon 's fate is really sealed this time ? was the nhc ep sil - u tely fed up with this system ? is this something that should be reflected in the article ? : it 's likely only a temporary change for this advisory . occasionally , the h pc has had to release advisories for the nhc before , perhaps due to e qu p im ent problems or scheduled service or upgrades that kept the nhc from issuing the advisory themselves . when i worked at the nws in detroit this summer , occasionally our office would issue things for grand rapids , and vice versa , if was necessary to do so for the reasons listed above . epsilon looks very rag ged at the moment , if it is n't a tropical storm by the pm est advisory , i will probably go insane . epsilon is going down - and fast . pressure has risen mb , winds down to mph . avila and the gang are probably having a party at the moment . turns out i do n't have to go insane after all . who ot ! pop the champ ai gne ! ( how do you spell it ? ) mph , and i thi k : p . m . is the last advisory for ze torture man ! he looks like gamma as a tropical depression ! skinned to where only the circulation is showing ! good ' ol wind shear ! : finally , his luck ran out . now is the season over ? or do we still have a surprise left ? o . o i looked at w under blog 's blog about epsilon 's death , and they said the remnant circulation has a small chance of becoming zeta . in about . oh . four days . please let it not be like epsilon . though if she wo n't , she would obviously not form anyway . everyone is sick of it . edit : oh crap ! i spelled my name wrong because of that ! : , december ( utc ) : the season finally ends ! epsilon sur renders at last . epsilon reminded me much of the season ; it just would n't quit . it 's over , it 's finally over ! now the nhc guys get a much needed break . - ' . epsilon weakening rapidly . this is the last advisory . it is about time . we love you , mr . avila , just so you know ) : pst ! it 's dr . avila . but we do love him . : whoever keeps changing the nice epsilon photo back to that ugly one with the orange lines , please stop\n",

' holds a new york state license in chinese medicine and has a clinical office on park avenue . he directs the research institute of global o hy siology , behavior and treatment . an ambassador of unesco , he is also chairman of athletes united for peace affiliated with the department of public information of the un . after earning his mpa , he . received his ph . d . from u . c . berkeley and was an assistant professor in sociology and history at rutgers and new york medical school ( epidemiology ) . he is a writer , publishing in scientific journals and in media such as the new york times . it 's from [ external link : this ] ; the it does n't say what his ph . d . is in , but it does say he was ( which i found at other places ) a med school as st . prof in epidemiology . - crum , any other objections ? i realise it would seem good for the bdort to use this citation , but it exists , it is board - certified md peer reviewed , the journal states this explicitly ; it is an independent journal . there is not much you can do about it . you are the only one in the last round of mediation that objected to it , i understand this leads on from your bias , but there it is all the same . your last argument was what the word ' since ' meant , in regard to the peer - review status of the journal , which i told you my opinion about . che ? i do n't see how a man with a phd in an unknown and undeclared field can be used as a high quality [ wiki link : wp : v wp source ] to support an outlandish medical claim about a procedure that will quickly and easily diagnose and cure most diseases known to mankind . this is exactly what jimbo referred to by explaining how for extraordinary claims we need extraordinary high quality sources . the publication itself , as i noted before , does not tell us that it was actually peer reviewed at the time shinnick 's article was published and or that his article was in fact reviewed by any medically and scientifically qualified person . hence i consider this an unacceptable scientific source . : his ph . d . is n't really what 's in question . what 's in question is whether he 's an expert in chinese medicine , as his stated objective is \" to provide an independent analysis of the o - ring as it is applied to the traditional chinese main meridian system , and to examine this technique 's applications in clinical medicine . \" do you think that holding a new york state license to practice chinese medicine qualifies him as an expert in it ? - : his qualifications to design , perform and report on a clinical study are in question , and his phd title is essential to inform us of his background . a phd in an unknown undeclared subject leaves the issue of his credentials as a clinical scientist unresolved . as far as the objectives of the study , as you say he says he will \" examine this technique 's applications in clinical medicine \" , in addition to the traditional chinese components . ' clinical medicine ' is mainstream medicine . i believe he would have to show proper credentials and background ( at a minimum board - certified md ) to make any scientific statement about mainstream medicine . : \" clinical medicine \" does not equal \" mainstream medicine \" . according to the american heritage sted man 's medical dictionary , \" clinical medicine \" is \" the study and practice of medicine based on direct observation of patients \" . which is in keeping with the definition of \" clinical \" , which is \" concerned with or based on actual observation and treatment of disease in patients rather than experimentation or theory \" . he is in fact making claims on how to treat patients , but not within the bounds of mainstream medicine . as a licensed practitioner of chinese medicine , do n't you think he 's an expert on clinical chinese medicine ? - : i am at a loss as to where you find that \" clinical medicine \" is not part of \" mainstream medicine \" . all the definitions i am aware of , including yours , which i will use here , effectively say : \" the study and practice of medicine based on direct observation of patients . \" ( emphasis mine ) . unless you otherwise quantify it , and especially in the western world , the word ' medicine ' as in \" practice of medicine \" in your own quotation means mainstream , not alternative medicine . in the west , \" doctor of medicine \" ( no qualifiers ) md mainstream , \" school of medicine \" mainstream , \" internal medicine \" mainstream , etc . if you wish to get someone else 's opinion on this point , which i think is fairly important , since this article involves alternative medicine , i would be pleased to hear other opinions . : how about we get the opinion of the dictionary i quoted from ? here 's what sted man has to say on medicine : the science of di ag no sing , treating , or preventing disease and other damage to the body or mind . : the branch of this science encompassing treatment by drugs , diet , exercise , and other non surgical means . : the practice of medicine . : do you dispute that bdort fits that definition ? - : i agree that the definition that you quoted is the generic term , which would encompass both western mainstream as well as alternative medicine . but my point was that in conventional usage in the west , the word ' medicine ' as in the sample items i used above , implies \" conventional \" . thus , in the west , if you hear the words \" school of medicine \" , \" internal medicine \" , \" doctor of medicine \" , etc . you assume that these are all mainstream . it is this implication assumption that i am referring to . so if in the west someone says \" clinical medicine \" , unless otherwise qualified , the implication is that it 's conventional and not alternative , just like the other items . : with all due respect , crum , do n't be ludicrous . are you really going to argue with a medical dictionary over the definition of clinical medicine ? and based on a \" some people say \" argument ? if it looks like a duck , and it sounds like a duck , and the american heritage duck dictionary says it 's a duck , then it 's a bleeding duck . you may not like it any , but it 's comes from people whose job it is to define these sorts of things . you 're grasping at straws covered in grease . phillip shinnick is a licensed practitioner of chinese medicine , which means he practices clinical medicine , even if it is alternative medicine . - : well , trying my best to follow your duck analogy in chinese medicine ( i 'm assuming this is not [ wiki link : peking duck ] ) , i still do n't quite follow you . i am not arguing with the dictionary definition , i accept it , as a broad and generic definition of ' medicine ' . what i am saying is that the accepted definition of ' clinical medicine ' in the west is normally conventional clinical medicine and not ' alternative medicine ' . to me , reading shinnick 's objectives , it is clear that he is using bdort for clinical medicine in general , not just the chinese variety . the article was published in the west , hence the connotation assumption is that the ' clinical medicine ' he is talking about is conventional ( aka mainstream ) clinical medicine , not only chinese . if you can show me proof , instead of your words , that shinnick is referring only narrowly to chinese clinical medicine in his study and paper , then i would see it differently . but as of now , it seems fairly clear to me that he is talking about both . : it seems pretty clear to me that shinnick does n't say a word about conventional medicine . alternative and complimentary medicine often claim to reach similar ends by different means , and that seems to me to be what shinnick is saying . it does n't look like he has anything to say about traditional surgery , medicines , ect . the fact that shinnick talks about using bdort on his patients seems to me to be a pretty clear indication that he as well is using the above definition of \" clinical medicine \" . i propose to you the exact opposite challenge : show us a place in the article where he makes a claim about traditional medicine . - : i would consider this fairly ' conventional medicine ' : ra di ography showed bone - density loss , anterior ver te bral o ste ophy tes , and hip restriction of side - bend . the diagnosis was disk disease degeneration of the lum bo sac ral spine , somatic dysfunction of the cervical spine , arthritis , and o ste op oro sis . i doubt that ancient chinese medicine had ra di ography available . hence , once he starts discussing modern ra di ological studies and results , he needs to be a radio logist , or at least an md . at this point we have no proof that he is either one . : it seems to me ( and i may be wrong here , i 'm not sure ) that he 's talking about diagnoses that other doctors made there . i do n't believe he practices co ven tional medicine , so when he says \" after the usual conventional medical procedure . \" etc , i assume it refers to what happened before his patients came to him . do you agree with this assessment ? - : let 's assume you are right , and examine the implications . he is untrained in conventional medicine ( we are assuming ) but is brought a patient that is shown to have problems based on conventional medicine . he then applies bdort - related techniques and claims the patient is better . to me that 's a combination of conventional and alternative medicines , which is my point : he is using bdort in a combined conventional and alternative medical environment . now think about it for a second : if in fact the patients improve , why would n't someone else there , like a regular medical doctor trained in conventional medicine , write ( and sign ) the paper and say : we did x , y , z and the patient improved ? i think you 've lost the forest for the trees . is there any independent credible evidence for the truth of the claim to peer review the journal makes for itself ? if so , where in a credible source is the journal cited ? if shinnick is a reputable researcher with credentials , is there any evidence for this assertion other than his having made the assertion ? these are simple questions . they should have clear , simple answers , not people pe ering into dictionaries asking what ' is ' means . : keep it simple . we can verify who he is ( see che 's ref re him above ) , the source is neutral and reliable ; the journal states it is peer - reviewed by mds . ( crum can not do wp : or and try to investigate journals to compare the peer - re vie we dness that they state ) . we can say that the study took place , who was involved , what they did , what was their stated objectives and what did they claim to find . all of that is wp very good . : i think , che , i am loosing trust that mediation will ever work , and that arbitration is the best way to go , as crum 's only once revealed underlying ( well - intentioned ) bias that you noted is so strong . i 'll wait a bit longer , but even in this example , at least other admins in mediation so far accepted this citation but crum is willing to argue down to what the word ' since ' means etc in order to somehow find a way not to allow it . also when biases exist and have been revealed , but are not declared openly , can you understand that good faith has much less meaning in reality ? ( from above ) now we 're getting somewhere : the claim is that , in order to base his practice off diagnoses made by other people , he ought to have an expertise in the methods which were used to make those diagnoses . but remember , whether or not it actually works is not for us to say . whether or not a conventional doctor signed a paper saying \" yep , shinnick cured this patient \" is immaterial . what we 're interested in here is what shinnick says about bdort , not what other doctors say about it ( those discussions are for the other disputed sources ) . so , does shinnick need expertise for diagnoses that he does n't make ? - : let 's say shinnick , assuming he is not a trained doctor , has a magic wand that is claimed to diagnose cure all . all he would need is a doctor to bring in the patient , testify as to the patient 's prior condition , let shinnick work his magic , then the doctor tests the patient and t esti fies as to results . assuming the doctor then published the study in a reputable peer reviewed journal , wp would accept this even if there are contradictory results and detractors , etc . otoh , what we have here is shinnick , a non - md , alone signed on the paper , for which we have no proof of peer review , and the paper describes procedures that at least partially rely on conventional medicine techniques . given that the claims made are extraordinary , wp requires extraordinarily high quality sources . i do n't see how this could be described as such . : so we ca n't use shinnick to say that bdort works , but i am not sure whether the intention here . so the question is , what are we trying to source with the journal article ? - : i guess this is a good time for richard to tell us what he wants to do with this paper . as i wrote above , very simply , we can relate what is described according to this reliable , neutral article : the bi - digital o - ring test , in its claimed application of detecting the ' electromagnetic resonance phenomenon ' between two identical substances or electromagnetic fields was tested by phillip shinnick phd , celia blum enthal md , adri ano bor gna md and jacob heller md , in a clinical research trial over a four year period involving patients with localized pain at the center for sports and osteopathic medicine in new york from to . during the study the bdort was applied di ag no s tically without knowledge of the standard western diagnoses that had been made earlier of the patients involved . according to shinnick et al , the bdort was able to detect the internal organ that was the causal factor of the pain arising from a referred acupuncture meridian phenomenon . the findings of this study were peer - reviewed by board - certified physicians . note that this says what shinnick says , not what the article says ; in short it is a citation that provides nuts and bolts information rather than justifications , proofs etc . : since we do n't have a source other than shinnick to say that this is what shinnick did , should it say \" bdort allegedly was applied . \" ? - : obviously this would not be acceptable . first , the md 's are not signed off as authors in the paper . second , a ' clinical research trial ' is clearly not restricted to chinese medicine , if there was any doubt of that , which proves that shinnick would not be qualified as an author of such a study unless he has credentials we do n't know about . third , we have no proof the paper was peer reviewed , which would be required for a scientific article making extraordinary claims . bottom line : i see no way that a person who is not a doctor can make ( or even ' allege ' ) statements in a clinical study to prove a radically new medical procedure , that would be acceptable on wp . all the other people , who appear to be md 's are not signed off on the paper and hence are not a factor here . ( and i am not going to speculate here why they did n't sign off as co - authors on a paper summarizing a study that they supposedly participated in ) . okay wait . so if i follow all this you are saying that shinnick says he 's qualified , but he does n't actually say what his qu ali f cations are , and he 's published in a journal that says it 's peer reviewed , but that there are no credible references for ? what , precisely , are shinnick 's qualifications , where , other than in his own business which he describes himself in an alumni magazine of some sort ? i 'm not saying he is n't necessarily qualified , but where , other than in his own words , in a journal that no one seems to have any independent reference to , is there any evidence for any of this . anyone can describe themselves anyway they want and anyone can publish something that says whatever they want . businesses are thr won out of wp all the time for this kind of naked self - f promotion and advertising . is this any different in any way anyone can actually check ? you people all throwing out opinions inter pre tings words out of dictionaries . do you have any actual verifiable facts to verify this man 's claims or this journals claims . or would an actual verifiable fact be too much to ask ? you prefer word games and opinion ating ? : no , not exactly : what we are saying is that shinnick is a licensed practitioner of chinese medicine which makes him qualified to speak on . chinese medicine . that 's very easy to check , and it 's been checked . now , shinnick says he 's used bdort , so we 're saying that . shinnick uses bdort . that 's all rather simple . : by the way , to say \" businesses are thrown out of wp all the time \" is simply untrue . articles on businesses are deleted often , true , but to be banned requires a lot more . : by the way , if you 're going to take part in these p rec ed ings which you are welcome to do please try to be constructive . - you do un dr stand right that you are busy arguing and looking up words about people pulling their fingers apart ? has anyone ever even heard of this ? they would ' nt believe it you know . : che , are we in agreement then , that richard 's sweeping statement above , basically saying that bdort has been ' clinically proven ' by shinnick et al is not acceptable ? if so , what can we use shinnick for , if anything ? : i think it 's pretty clear that the article supports the fact that shinnick , a practitioner of chinese medicine , claims to have successfully tested bdort . is that not enough ? - che , you are not coherently and consistently addressing the criteria for inclusion as to reference in this entry . reference to wp criteria 's existence is insufficient imho . what , precisely , as moderator , is your interpretation of those criteria as applicable to this entry ? use small words . i 'm slow , but i 'll see if i can keep pace with a s wi f ter and sub tler intellect , fair enough ? : whiffle , i 'm attempting to discuss this entry . i have n't come to a solid conclusion about this citation i 'm attempting to stimulate discussion , posing questions challenges to the others involved , and attempting to find out what the real issues below the conflict over this citation ( if not the article as a whole ) are . - i thought your job was to moderate , that is to facilitate the parties coming together in a more functional manner how is that process aided by your acting as a judge while denying you 're a judge ? you clearly have an atheist and a believer , here . do you expect to reconcile them ? that wo n't happen , ever . do you expect to judge for them ? neither party will accept that , in the end , and you know it . do you actually have a plan here ? you seem to be unwilling to state your criteria other than to allude both to wp and to your feeling very strongly that you are to interpret that f le xi bly as you think best . what does that mean , in the end ? : first , i do n't expect to judge . i do n't care what richard or crum or you or anyone else thinks . really . could n't care less . : second , i 'm never going to get richard and crum to agree on the merits ( or lack thereof again , i do n't really care ) of bdort , and have nothing even remotely resembling a desire to do so . seriously . do n't care . : but what i can do is encourage them to get deep down into the issues , discuss things in terms of policy ( which always has to be interpreted ) , and challenge them to re evaluate the assumptions that they bring to the table . that 's the only possible way to achieve consensus . that , or either richard or crum leaving . and i have no desire to see richard or crum leave , because i believe they are both good editors . i do have a desire to see them come to some sort of agreement on how to apply wikipedia policy to this article . : my criteria are quite simple : applying wikipedia policy in the way which makes the most sense . i realize that this will be slightly different to everyone , and i readily accept that . and if i challenge something that crum or richard says , it 's not because i necessarily think they are incorrect , but because i want to challenge them to think of things in a different way . : so that 's my plan . if you do n't like it , you do n't have to pay any attention to it . i assume , however , that crum and richard are both alright with the way i 'm doing things , because they 're still here . ( of course , guys , i do n't want to put words in your mouths , so reply to that with however you feel , if you feel the need to do so . ) - crum , you misrepresent what i wrote , i do not say that has been clinically proven . where did i say that ? i said what i said , that shinnick did what he did and wrote what he wrote in the journal that is reliable and neutral ( that way back in discussion after i pinned down what you required re this citation you agreed was ) . are you saying that we cant say that what shinnick says he did ? : richard , to me if someone is saying , effectively , \" the procedure was tested in a peer reviewed study and was able to detect the causal factor of pain \" ( my paraphrasing ) , it is another way to say \" clinically proven \" . i do n't accept the article was peer reviewed as we have no proof of that , i do n't accept that shinnick is qualified to design , perform or write about a clinical study , as we have no proof of that , i do n't accept that wp may cite as a source such a reference since it does not meet its criteria for excellent sourcing that are needed when extraordinary claims are made , as is the case here . i hope this makes my position clearer . crum , it is a perfectly reliable , neutral , source , and can be used perfectly fine in wp policies as such , to say what it says . a claim can be reported quite simple without wp claiming anything , many admins have told you this already . re the peer - review status , what criteria are you using to decide if a journal by mds for mds that says that all its articles are peer - re vie e wed are not peer - reviewed ? what normal \" proof \" are you talking about , give an actual example of this please ? che , comments ? : i will assume this unsigned message is from richard and not from mr . whiffle or someone else . : just because you say something is reliable or neutral , does n't necessarily make it so . in the case of extraordinary claims every source has to be proven reliable and neutral . let me start with your point about \" by mds for mds \" . if this is true , as they claim , then why is this apparently medical paper written by shinnick , a non - md with an unknown phd ? does n't this cast doubt over the publication ? : now , i am not sure what you mean about \" admins telling me \" - and i am not sure if that is wp policy that admins are the official interpreters of wp sourcing policies , but let 's take your statement about \" wp claims \" . you are saying that \" a claim can be reported quite simple without wp claiming anything \" . i beg to differ . according to my admittedly limited understanding , in a controversial article making extraordinary claims such as this one , we can only include statements that are backed up by excellent sources . if there are no such sources available , the statement stays out . now let 's get to the \" peer reviewed \" issue . you gave us a pointer to a statement that said the journal has been improved over the years in various ways , including by adding peer review . it does not say exactly what year the peer review was added , and we do n't know if this article was in fact peer reviewed , and if so by whom . we certainly have no references to this paper or journal in the mainstream press that i am aware of . bottom line : this medical paper was written by a person with no proven medical credentials , in a journal that has no mainstream references , with no mainstream references to the paper . it does not meet the definition of ' excellent ' sourcing that would be required when making extraordinary or outlandish claims , and hence can not be included . : crum , what you 're saying would absolutely be true if we were trying to make claims about bdort as a procedure . claims about bdort 's efficacy would indeed be extraordinary claims . however , the fact that shinnick has attested to bdort 's efficacy is in fact a rather mundane claim . similarly , the fact that shinnick claims that his experiment was successful is a rather mundane claim . : in the absence of extraordinary evidence regarding bdort , mundane evidence regarding the belief in bdort serves a significant function . take , as analogy , [ wiki link : creationism ] : to attest to the factual accuracy of creationist theories would indeed require extraordinary evidence , evidence which in fact is not present in the article . but the article does n't attest to creationism what it does handle is the belief in creationism , without making judgments about the belief one way or the other . : it seems to me that the shinnick paper is rather good evidence of the fact that some medical professionals ( ie shinnick and his research partners ) recognize bdort as legitimate and use it . : would n't you agree ? - : yes , i agree that there are non - md ' alternative medicine ' practitioners who apparently use bdort . we already know about gorringe , and what happened to him , and apparently shinnick is ( or was ) also such a person . if the issue is \" are there some people who use bdort ? \" - then we know of ( besides omura and his colleagues ) . how to plug that statement into the article , and where , i am not exactly sure . as che says , we can use this citation as i originally suggested , to say not only that these people have used it , but the fact that they have in their opinion tested it and in their opinion recognize that it is valuable and can do what they ' found ' it can do . the extraordinary claims argument , as che says , does not apply . whiffle , are you the same person that has previously used the name arc sin co stan , or any other similar handle , or ever participated here under another name ? i am whiffle . you are not whiffle . who are you ? if you pull your fingers apart while holding them tight can you tell who you are ? i think you are dr . yoshiaki omura ch ann eling through australia . who do you think you are ?

      "my name is drag omir min kov from bulgaria and i want to tell some things about macedonian bulgarian issue . first i think that how you call bulgarians and macedonians ( in present country macedonia ) is not such a big problem because it is clear for almost anyone that they are one nation ( or may be they was , we was ) . when i finish reading all of igor 's writing , i 'm very sure that he ( and his grandfather ) can give us may be a thousands more facts to argue me ! i can tell you one thing : i tried to read some parts of wikipedia on russian , serbian , ukrainian , croatian but i did not understand much , but guess what i did understand all and i really mean all when i change to macedonian . i 'm not saying that macedonian language is a bulgarian dialect , but i 'm saying that they have almost no grammar differences ! that is a fact that macedonians and bulgarians can see more easily that all facts that igor told us , just switch wikipedia 's languages where this is available . after and next - years present macedonia is not given to bulgarian country because of scare of western , central and european countries of existing of such a big country in balkans and many macedonians did not want this too . after the two world wars , macedonia was included in yugoslavia because bulgaria in the two cases was defeated . there are many more reasons . even that my mother is born in bulgarian town goce del chev , i 've never been in west - southern bulgaria ( bulgarian macedonia ) and i live in varna ( on the black sea ) ! i 've talk once or twice with people from that region and i 'm pretty sure that igor will understand them more clearly and faster than me ! to talk now about that bulgaria and macedonia should be one country is not serious . for example : are russia and ukraine one country now ( even that their situation is a little bit different ) ? bulgaria and macedonia have different present and they will have different future ! but they had one past and del chev is not bulgarian or macedonian now , he was bulgarian macedonians then . and \" why would he fight for macedonia 's independence if he was bulgarian ? \" - because macedonia was part of bulgarian country before turkish empire and he wanted all regions where were living bulgarians ( bulgarian macedonians ) to be free and that is what people were called that part of bulgaria - macedonia ! i do n't know what igor 's grandfather really told him ( if even igor 's grandfather does or exist ) but it is first time that i heard that bulgaria attacked macedonia in second world war . even that is true , and this suspicious grandfather of igor is really shot times ( and all times by bulgarians , do n't forget ! ) , i 'm not sure that he can tell what really happened those days or what was real situation then or anything that we can except for an even truth ! why ? because my grandfather ( who also was a soldier in second world war ) though and he was convinced that communist ideology are the best thing that ever happened on bulgaria and in the world and communists they never would do ( or did ) anything bad or no humanity or crime to anybody ! we all will agree that this is absolutely not true and we can not take all words of our parents and grandparents for true and just minutes talking to them will convince us in something that of historians ( who are people that are professionals in that area ) told and tell us that are not true ! about tsar samuel , it was so long a go but again most of sources tell that he was been bulgarian king and because of capital of former bulgarian empire was moved in ohrid , some \" genius \" was decided because present macedonia has no really history , why he can not created one ! ? and became propagate that and now macedonia has thing with what to be proud ! i think that is very good idea because it is popular theory only in macedonia ! about that present macedonians have anything common with people had lived in macedonian empire or talks about that there was people lived in those lands - i will say that i am descendant of adam and eve . drag omir . min kov gmail . com\n",

( this is an encyclopedia , hence neutrality must be maintained . this is not a eulogy page to your pashtun romance ) . secondly , i have not come across a single source by any historian which records tanolis as pashtun , absolutely none . i would appreciate a y ous af zai text which would accept them as their brethren ( again there is none ) i would gladly accept a local account for this by neighbouring y ous af zais etc but again i am diss appointed here too . ' al afghani ya tanoli ' is a strange case . pashtuns are not the be all and end all of all things afghan . syed 's are absolutely not pashtun , yet they are afghans by loc alised centuries of inhabit ance and cultural practice . so tanolis culturally afghan background is not disputed . but to change their entire history , batch them up together as one ethnic group ( which you have agreed is in question anyway ) is a poor attempt without doubt . : , november utc ) reply to su pers ai yan raja i may have a lot more of of resources to back up my position than you have . you are only quoting what you 've read in non - tanoli janjuas and also misquoting from the imperial gazetteer of nwfp . i have already said what the original gazetteer says on page - janjuas are not mentioned there at all . : if you actually read what was stated in context then you would have read that it was an elaboration of the tanolis position in the early th century after having been almost completely reduced by the sikhs , but for the grace of amb as a remaining capital and it 's measurements . you must read before jumping to conclusions . secondly , you are on a mission to prove something that never was i . e . raja tanoli is in the minds of the janjua theorist as he did not exist in tan aw al . in any case his name has never been spelt in the references as tan aw ali nor tan au li . only proper tan aw alis have been written in different ways . you are doing this to make sure the narrative is as close to the writings on the real tan aw alis of which tanoli is a later corruption . : strange , you disagree on the way the word is written in english when we know most tribal names have never been spelt consistently as one name as english being a new language in the continent ? what is the relevance of this to the argument ? none . moreover , in rawalpindi the janjuas are known as kas bis i . e . those that are in v ol v edin men ial tasks - hardly a raja thing to do . : my dear your false notions without resources are now proven beyond doubt ! and that is simply because i have with me a copy of the rawalpindi gazetteer itself which states ; \" . they are proud of their ancestry , make good soldiers , bad ag ri c ul turi sts . they are usually addressed as \" raja \" , and stand very high in social rank . their wi do ws do not re marry and they only give their daughters to janjuas or sai ads . \" ( , sang - e - me el publications , p ) i can even print a picture of the actual reference itself which proves this beyond doubt should you require it ? infact , i challenge you to provide me a reference where it states clearly that the janjua are as you say , especially in a more reputable source than an official government report on a district - ) you cann not my friend . infact there is no proof that a syed would even take a daughter from the tanolis at all anywhere . but funnily enough , just for your information , i can even quote a particular source which alleges the bar las theory ( which you purport also too ) , but states clearly and somewhat truthfully ; \" . they ( tanolis ) are an in du stri ous and peaceful race of c ul tiv ators ; but their bad faith has given rise to the saying - \" tan aw ali be - q au li \" , the tan a ol is word \" is naught \" . \" ( pan jab castes , baloch , pathan and allied races chapter , sir d . ib bet son delhi , , p - ) and thats by someone who is n't a janjua or any other tribe to do with india infact . all things considered , the tan a ol is allied with the british so you ca n't even say there was an ulterior motive here pt . and you thought you could call a proud tribe kas bis and get away with it , lol . this may be an explanation for the extreme minority among the tanolis who may say they are janjuas because they are trying to escape their hu ble origins . they can not be included in the major clans of pak ht uns tanolis ( the majority in the region ) as in such a close - knit society it hard to escape your roots as everyone knows the history of the various families among them . this has also happened to other non - pakhtun clans within tan ol and ag ror . the sha dw als have in recent years started claiming to be aw ans . thus what is happening is when some families can not prove their link with the major , powerful clans or sub - tribes they end up claiming an association that the locals know nothing about . this is very common among indian lower castes - please consult the relevant literature . : again i challenge you to prove it . after a numerous requests for reliable sources to quote your \" theories \" can you provide just one to back this basic assumption up ? i am aware that certain tribes did allege rajput status to get into the pakistani army , but were is the proof for pakhtun wannabe driven recruitment ? what purposes did this serve ? here is a link of someone who is a punjabi tanoli and accepted as one officially ( read it for a change instead of ignoring it ) i consider this appropriate for you to do as the same thing is happening in your writing . you seem to be ru bb ishing everything that contr dic ts your position even the fact that the ruling family do not know who raja tanoli is and all they know he might have come from another planet as rajputs are so fond of telling us they have lunar descent . i can use another term here to expand the lunar concept but i shall refrain from doing so in the interest of ne tte quest or wiki ethics . : strange , because you just admit below that you were intentionally provocative . it 's usually a sign of insecurity , but hey , glad to help . regarding the lunar descent , it 's a given for hindu rajputs to believe , but muslim rajputs do not subscribe to it beyond a mere cl assing of the main branch possibly from a similar ancestor . one of your tanoli brethren once alleged on the tanoli page that he was a descendant of hazrat y ous af ( as ) ! you cant get more incorrect than that since his lineage never extended my friend , read you own facts before stating them for the world to see and today ridicule . as a punjabi you are on a mission but the only answer to this i can give you is that you as an outsider can not impose on us your views as our folk history , written accounts for centuries have held us to be of afghan , turkic and mughal origin and this is in the genes , history and traditions . it is also in the par aw ali s wa ti wali of our conduct and in our faces . as a member of a leading aristocratic family in the region i have much more to contribute to the debate than you can as a outsider hell - bent on trying to prove otherwise that tanolis are predominantly janjuas . : i dont care who you allege to be , but the fact that you have not provided a single credible source is very strange and suspect . you havent been able to counter the evidence i produced so far and not even offered any yourself . my royal credentials do n't need an ego boost on wikipedia unlike your strange reason to try and accomodate yours on a janjua page , but my own direct ancestors were mentioned by mughal babur himself as ai des ( rai sang ar khan janjua ) and even as close family with the powerful real pashtun ni azi tribe ( lang ar khan ni azi described as a motivating force by babur was a maternal nephew of the janjua ) . even more strange is that mughal babur did not mention anywhere the existence of either tan aw al , or a tanoli sar da ar khan . i wonder what happened there pt ? if you are so proud of your roots then how come you use raja as a title and not singh as is the tradition among real rajputs of raj pu tana ? : because we are not hindus of raja stan ( note the kh anz adas of rajasthan since conversion never adopted singh as their middle names either ) , besides , singh is a name , not a title , i . e . have you ever heard of any rajput calling themselves the \" ma has in gh of such and such \" ? ofcourse not . raja is a hereditary title and hence it us used , as documented above . i do hope that helps you understand us a little better - ) the tern kh ans ahi b is used for all pak ht uns regardless of whether he has it as his surname formally . non - pak ht uns and non - mughals who use the name usually have been given it as an honour by the british rulers . does this mean that those non - pak ht uns and non - mughals who have adopted this name are their descendents ? should i or ad pot sir as a title because sir ak ram khan was thus honoured by queen victoria . : why not ? you seem to allege that you have adopted a geographical reference as a surname , which is just as equally justified . this term is actually in contrast to what i have read as the name \" khan \" is used , never \" kh ans ahi b \" consistently . the term khan is actually an original mongolian mughal title . where you can now allege the title to suddenly be conferred only by the british exclusively is certainly an erroneous and du cious misconception sadly contrary to history . name me one pashtun family who used the name khan prior to the th century please ? infact you can not provide me a single y ous af zai or mughal source that presents tanolis as either brethren or accepts you as a genuine pashtun origin , although i have quoted sources on your [ wiki link : tanoli ] of sources who state that you are not accepted as [ wiki link : pashtuns ] . even the pashtun discussion page users refused to accept you as pashtun , but you keep vandal si ing the evidence presented on the tanoli page to distort it . then you lu di cr ously allege that i rubbish your evidence ? if i remember correctly , i actually incorporated your pashtun theory into the tanoli article and left it to the reader to decide for themselves , encyclopedically . you wiped it off and now allege wiki ethics . hypocrisy at it 's best . i shall enter into this debate with you and answer some of your other erroneous assertions later . i think this is enough for now . i have been rather provocative in places and this was my intention to take this debate to the next level . pakhtun tanoli : november : pm\n",

      "a and b have been discussed in mediation and agreed by consensus to be deleted including all references inferred from them . c still in discussion . contested quackwatch a ) quackwatch characterization of the bi - digital o - ring test or ' omura test ' en passant . see for mediation outcome : [ externa link : http : en . wikipedia . org wiki talk : yoshiaki omura mediation archive ] * i disagree , cant see the reason to repeat ; shakes my faith in this from the outset ; but i will go along with it . ok , so the quackwatch citation : it does not mention the description \" quackery \" or \" pseudoscience \" directly related to bdort - therefore it is not a relevant citation at all . all sentences that refer , derive , cite it should be deleted . since we should only use information based on agreed reliable sources , the see also section labelling the bdort should also be deleted . its historically arc sin co stan 's notion to make this entry an example of what he believes this is - pseudoscience . but there is no reference for this whatsoever , and it is merely opinion . why not add \" science \" as a see also too ? labelling without a citation is not on at all . categorizing in this manner is also not on at all . unless there is a citation that directly uses this word in refutation of the tens of mds phds that publish on bdort ( some very em in in ent ) any even indirect mention of it is purely pov . everything has to be citated . * do n't you think it would be closer to or than pov ? ' pseudoscience ' has a pretty clear definition , but if no one has published a source using the term in conjunction with bdort , then is n't applying the term personally or ? - : well , if we are starting to discuss this issue , let me make a couple of points . first , i agree with richard ( as i always have ) that categorizing this article as [ wiki link : pseudoscience ] per se is incorrect . i personally believe that ' pseudoscience ' should go into the ' see also ' , as it is mentioned in the nzt report , which could be understood to allege or imply that bdort is pseudoscience ( we can go into that separately later ) . if there is such an allegation or implication , by a respectable source , in my opinion we should include the entry in the ' see also ' for the reader to educate him herself on the issue so as to be able to form his her own opinion . si mi lary for [ wiki link : quackery ] . we have a fairly prominent [ external link : web site ] ( perhaps the most notable in the world for quackery watching ) alleging that bdort is quackery ( just being listed in this site is already a form of implicit allegation ) . hence , here too i believe if there is doubt being cast , let the reader find out from us what [ wiki link : quackery ] is ( in the see also ) if so inclined , and let him her form their own opinion on the matter . again , i do n't feel that casting the article as pseudoscience or quackery category is appropriate , but a ' see also ' inclusion is the correct way to let the reader inform him self and decide on his her own . : but do you agree that the quackwatch page does n't actually say any of this ? - : i am referring to [ external link : this ] which is linked to [ external link : this article ] , which refers to the same gorringe case we are citing in our article . quoting fro mt the quackwatch article : the test gorringe used is called peak muscle resistance testing ( pmrt ) also referred to as bi digital o ring testing ( bdort ) in which the practitioner observes whether the subject 's opposed thumb and fourth fingers can be pulled apart before and after the patient is exposed to various substances . proponents claim that \" weakness \" of the fingers means that the person is having a problem with the test substance . . the muscle test , of course , has no scientific basis and has never been validated . moreover , the idea that contact with substances in sealed vi als can affect the body is preposterous , and so is the idea that [ the patient ] would be tested having her touch her mother while her mother held the vi als . the article continues on to describe how gorringe was subsequently fined and stripped of his license . the quackwatch site has this prominent banner on top : \" quackwatch - your guide to quackery , health fraud , and intelligent decisions \" . i believe that a reasonable person reading this reference can conclude that quackwatch is implying or alleging [ wiki link : quackery ] on the part of gorringe , and through him on bdort as a medical technique . what i am saying is that if there is implication or allegation of quackery , then we should let the reader be informed on what the term means , so they can judge for themselves . i agree that wp should not opine on the matter , but it can and should provide the reader with wiki - linked information to understand the terminology . : just to clarify if this is not already clear , i am referring to nzt for pseudoscience reference , and to quackwatch for quackery reference . : so you 're proposing using the link you 've pointed out instead of the one cited on the page ? - : i would use whatever gives the reader the most information . what i have done up to now with quackwatch is simply search for ' bdort ' on the main page - that 's how i got the cite above . : the point that richard is making is that the article currently cited is n't even about bdort . if you 'd like to propose another one , we can do that at a later time ( it does n't make sense to me to discuss two different unrelated articles at once , even if they are from the same host ) . the real question is , do you agree with his assessment of the qw article currently cited in our article ? - : i agree that the currently cited qw page does not represent all the bdort related material available on the qw site . so for simplicity let 's just assume for now a combination of the one currently in the article plus the one that i cited , which is what you get if you just go to www . quackwatch . org , enter ' bdort ' in the search field , and follow the links . obviously we could get an admin to add this link for us into the article , but i do n't think it 's critical at this time . : another clarification , a couple of points . first , the citation in the article was done by another editor ( arc ) . i considered it only as a ' place holder ' for qw , as the article is still incomplete ( this is in fact one of the ' minor issues ' that i referred to above that needed improvement imo ) . second , richard 's point above has to do with the rationale for the ' see also ' section having a wikilink to [ wiki link : quackery ] and [ wiki link : pseudoscience ] , and my response here is specifically addressed to his points that we have no source to justify that see also section . hopefully this is clearer . it 's clearer , but it does n't answer the question . the question is , do you agree that the currently cited article is n't actually about bdort ? because if it 's not about bdort , then reason dictates it should n't really be on this page , right ? - : the cited qw article is not directly about bdort , but does mention it as \" the o - ring test or the omura test \" and goes on to mention omura ( which is the subject of this article ) . the qw article says that bdort is used to validate the bracelet , which is the primary subject of the qw article . the qw article then links into [ external link : this bdort site ] . so no , this is not directly about bdort , but it does mention that bdort is used to validate the subject bracelet , and does provide a link to bdort for further reading . but as i mentioned above , though this qw article would be acceptable as a more general reference to our omura bo dr t article , i think we should also include the main bdort entry on the qw site . crum , now i understand why you did not agree to just start from where we left on in mediation . the cited article does not label the bdort directly as either of these terms . that is the end of the discussion re it as far as i am concerned and all the others in the mediation also agreed . you then quote the other site that describes pmrt and bdort as the same thing . you know that the trib uni al noted word for word that they r co gn ized that what gorringe was practicing does not resemble omura 's bdort and so does not assist them at all . we have gone over this repeatedly . in summary , no direct citation : no entry . re the see also , this is just another way of trying to say the same thing . it does n't wash . i know you have the good intention of warning the world of your perceived dangers in the use of the bdort , as you wrote to addhoc on his talk page , but wp is not for that purpose . it is an encyclopedia . : richard , my primary mission here is to write ( or otherwise ensure ) good wp articles . if it happens to help people in various ways , i see that as a beneficial side effect . in the case of bdort omura , all i really want , as for all wp articles , is to have a well written , properly sourced and balanced article . i have no other agenda . : i 'm a little surprised that this citation is so quickly becoming such a big deal . it seems pretty clear to me that a page not about bdort should be an easy case , no ? the page that you ( crum ) brought up aside , the simple question is , is the qw page currently cited relevant ? - : the current qw article is relevant to bdort and omura . it is not a direct support for the need to clarify ' pseudoscience ' and or ' quackery ' . for that we have the other qw article and the nzt . but the current qw article is still relevant to the omura bdort article in general , per my explanation above . just to clarify for che , here is my awful message to addhoc , where according to richard i show my true pov colors as a crazed anti - bdort advocate : addhoc , thank you for your well - meaning efforts at that article . although i disagree on technical grounds with many of your changes , it may be good to you to get involved with the article and learn about it , so i will postpone my comments and refrain from reverting you for now . if you are truly committed to spend the countless hours defending wp 's npov against an admitted advocate of bdort , who sells it for a living , despite the procedure ( and related techniques ) being declared ' . irresponsible and unacceptable ' by a medical disciplinary review board in nz , please carry on . be aware however , that the advocates , of which we have seen several , will persist until the article will look their way . when they are done , it will say that bdort is a wonderful technique , that can diagnose and heal most diseases , from the common cold to cancer , and has simply not been appreciated by mainstream medicine . be also aware that there are people out there , potential wp readers , who will rely on bdort to the exclusion of conventional diagnoses and treatments , as was the case in nz , with possible dire consequences . it is clearly not wp 's role to perform any wp : or , and we must only present wp : npov and wp : rs . but under persistent daily barrage and pressure of the bdort advocates , the article can gradually er ode , as well meaning editors , such as yourself , may not have the same willingness to devote the needed hours per day , every day , to it to defend against the professional advocates , who will persist indefinitely , as their live li hoods clearly depend on it . again , i will let you try this out for a while to get the feel of the situation and decide if you wish in fact to commit the needed long term resources to it . thanks , crum thanks for reading , : whoa , please take a step back . nobody is saying that you are a \" crazed advocate \" or that your message was \" awful \" . what you say in that message does express your opinion of the matter pretty clearly , even if you do n't say it explicitly . but richard did not say what you seem to be attributing to him ; please remember to continue assuming good faith . : i regards to the currently cited article , if you believe it is relevant , please demonstrate how . remember , this article is technically about omura and not bdort . - : well , i only pasted the copy here to make sure anyone who reads this discussion knows my position and motivation also . as far as the current qw article , i do n't see how it does not belong to the omura article in general . first , the current omura article is the historical merge of bdort and omura . second , the afd ' keep ' was predicated on the fact that omura would n't be notable without his claim - to - fame bdort invention , hence bdort figures prominently in the article . hence any reference that sheds more light on bdort and related controversies is relevant , imo . btw , the current qw article does mention both omura and bdort . : in som uch as it mentions both of them , yes . but is n't it true that the article is about the qt q - ring bracelet ? the q - ring bracelet does not rely on bdort ; it only claims that bdort proves its effectiveness . the refutation from qw is that the results of the bdort test with respect to the q - ring bracelet are probably psycho somatic . is n't it true that tried - and - true proven medical tests can also return results that are the result of psycho somatic effects and not of actual medical effects ? so what does that actually say about bdort ? - : che , you have to understand that we do n't have a lot of references of any kind about bdort omura , ignoring those from bdort omura related sites and a few others that i am sure we 'll get to bash around soon . so this reference that talks about a use of bdort and mentions omura as its inventor is important even if it said almost nothing except mention them . in this case , i also understand that bdort is claimed by the bracelet maker to be a ' proof ' for its efficacy . that is all that i would take out of this reference - omura is mentioned , bdort is mentioned , and bdort is claimed by the bracelet maker to validate its product . i think this is a reasonable bit of information for someone reading about bdort and omura . i am not saying this is where we get the pseudoscience or quackery allegations . all i am saying is that this reference can add some information to the bdort omura article . so your suggestion , crum , is that this reference be included only to validate the statement that qt inc claims that bdort proves the effectiveness of its bracelet ? richard , what do you say to that ? - che , first i did not reply to your point above ; yes i think more correct that what i describe is or than pov , as you note . next . well , in my opinion this is a very tri val bit of information that crum wants to include in the article ; however i do not object to it - it is citated and some people might think it is tremendously important i suppose - so long as it says only what it says and no or . so to reiterate what che has stated and clarify : this reference is to be used only and solely to say that \" a company by the name of qt inc claims that the bdort proves the effectiveness of its br ac let \" ( or some minor word change - but no other information whatsoever ) . ok , fine . but i do not think that this bit of information should go in the leading paragraph - surely it is not really essentially something that gives an overview of what the article is about . it can go in somewhere lower down . agree to this - but only narrowly as che points out , yes . also need to note that we can define \" lot of references \" as we please - but in point of fact we have about listed below that specifically are about the bdort . dominic lu b ) dominic lu , quoted on yoshiaki omura 's japanese web site . see for mediation outcome : [ externa link : http : en . wikipedia . org wiki talk : yoshiaki omura mediation archive ] mp dt of nz re : gorringe c ) medical practitioners disciplinary tribunal of new zealand findings in re richard gorringe and the pmrt bi - digital o - ring test . - citation ok . reason : selectively quoted from object to . also wp : or using this citation object to\n",

      "then where , oedipa wondered , does the paperback i bought at zap f 's get off with its \" trystero \" line ? was there yet another edition , besides the qu ar to , folio , and \" whitechapel \" fragment ? the editor 's preface , signed this time , by one emory bortz , professor of english at cal , mentioned none . she spent nearly an hour more , searching through all the footnotes , finding nothing . \" dammit , \" she yelled , started the car and headed for the berkeley campus , to find professor bortz . she should have remembered the date on the book . another world . the girl in the english office informed oedipa that professor bortz was no longer with the faculty . he was teaching at san narciso college , san narciso , california . of course , ode ipa thought , w ry , where else ? she copied the address and walked away trying to remember who 'd put out the paperback . she could n't . it was summer , a weekday , and mid afternoon ; no time for any campus oedipa knew of to be jumping , yet this one was . she came down slope from wheeler hall , through sa ther gate into a plaza te eming with cor du roy , den im , bare legs , blonde hair , horn ri ms , bicycle s po kes in the sun , book bags , sw aying card tables , long paper petitions dangling to earth , posters for un dec ip her able f sm 's , yaf 's , v dc 's , su ds in the fountain , students in nose - to - nose dialogue . sj ie jo iq y jg d through it carrying her fat book , attracted , unsure , a stranger , wanting to feel relevant but knowing how much of a search among alternate universes it would take . for she had undergone her own educating at a time of nerves , bl and ness and retreat among not only her fellow students but also most of the visible structure around ahead of them , this having been a national reflex to certain pa tho logies in high places only death had the power to cure , and this berkeley was like no som no lent si wash out of her own past at all , but more akin to those far eastern or latin american universities you read about , those autonomous culture media where the most beloved of folk lores may be brought into doubt , cat ac ly s mic of dis sen ts voiced , suicidal of commitments cho sen the sort that bring governments down . but it was english she was hearing as she crossed ban croft way among the blonde children and the mu ttering hon das and su - zuk is ; american english . where were secretaries james and foster and senator joseph , those dear daft nu mina who 'd mo thered over oedipa 's so temperate youth ? in another world . along another pattern of track , another string of decisions taken , switches closed , the faceless point smen who 'd thrown them now all transferred , deserted , in stir , fleeing the skip - tr ac ers , out of their skull , on horse , alcoholic , fanatic , under aliases , dead , impossible to find ever again . among them they had managed to turn the young oedipa into a rare creature indeed , unfit perhaps for marches and sit - ins , but just a whiz at pursuing strange words in j ac o bean texts . she pulled the imp ala into a gas station somewhere along a gray stretch of telegraph avenue and found in a phone book the address of john nefastis . she then drove to a pseudo - mexican apartment house , looked for his name among the u . s . mail boxes , ascended outside steps and walked down a row of dra ped windows till she found his door . he had a crew cut and the same underage look as ko te ks , but wore a shirt on various polynesian themes and dating from the truman administration . introducing herself , she invoked the name of stanley ko te ks . \" he said you could tell me whether or not i 'm a ' sensitive ' . \" nefastis had been watching on his tv set a bunch of kids dancing some kind of a wat usi . \" i like to watch young stuff , \" he explained . \" there 's something about a little chick that age . \" so does my husband , \" she said . \" i understand . \" john nefastis be amed at her , si mp a tico , and brought out his machine from a work room in back . it looked about the way the patent had described it . \" you know how this works ? \" stanley gave me a kind of run down . \" he began then , be wilder ingly , to talk about something called entropy . the word bothered him as much as \" trystero \" bothered oedipa . but it was too technical for her . she did gather that there were two distinct kinds of this entropy . one having to do with heat - engines , the other to do with communication . the equation for one , back in the ' o 's , had looked very like the equation for the other . it was a coincidence . the two fields were entirely unconnected , except at one point : maxwell 's demon . as the demon sat and sorted his molecules into hot and cold , the system was said to lose entropy . but somehow the loss was offset by the information the demon gained about what molecules were where . \" communication is the key , \" cried nefastis . \" the demon passes his data on to the sensitive , and the sensitive must reply in kind . there are untold billions of molecules in that box . the demon collects data on each and every one . at some deep psychic level he must get through . the sensitive must receive that staggering set of energies , and feed back something like the same quantity of information . to keep it all cycling . on the secular level all we can see is one piston , hopefully moving . one little movement , against all that massive complex of information , destroyed over and over with each power stroke . \" help , \" said oedipa , \" you 're not reaching me . \" entropy is a figure of speech , then , \" sigh ed nefastis , \" a metaphor . it connects the world of ther mo - dynamics to the world of information flow . the machine uses both . the demon makes the metaphor not only verbally graceful , but also objectively true . \" but what , \" she felt like some kind of a heretic , \" if the demon exists only because the two equations look alike ? because of the metaphor ? \" nefastis smiled ; im pen e tr able , calm , a believer . \" he existed for clerk maxwell long before the days of the metaphor . \" but had clerk maxwell been such a fanatic about his demon 's reality ? she looked at the picture on the outside of the box . clerk maxwell was in profile and would not meet her eyes . the forehead was round and smooth , and there was a curious bump at the back of his head , covered by curling hair . his visible eye seemed mild and non com mi tt al , but oedipa wondered what han gu ps , crises , s po ok ings in the middle of the night might be developed from the shadowed subtleties of his mouth , hidden under a full beard . \" watch the picture , \" said nefastis , \" and concentrate on a cylinder . do n't worry . if you 're a sensitive you 'll know which one . leave your mind open , receptive to the demon 's message . i 'll be back . \" he returned to his tv set , which was now showing cartoons . oedipa sat through two yogi bears , one mag illa gorilla and a peter po tam us , staring at clerk maxwell 's en ig matic profile , waiting for the demon to communicate . are you there , little fellow , oedipa asked the demon , or is nefastis putting me on . unless a piston moved , she 'd never know . clerk maxwell 's hands were cropped out of the photograph . he might have been holding a book . he ga zed away , into some vista of victorian england whose light had been lost forever . oedipa 's anxiety grew . it seemed , behind the beard , he 'd begun , ever so fa in tly , to smile . something in his eyes , certainly , had changed . and there . at the top edge of what she could see : had n't the right - hand piston moved , a fraction ? she could n't look directly , the instructions were to keep her eyes on clerk maxwell . minutes passed , pist ons remained frozen in place . high - pitched , comic voices issued from the tv set . she had seen only a re tin al t wi tch , a mis fired nerve cell . did the true sensitive see more ? in her colon now she was afraid , growing more so , that nothing would happen . why worry , she worried ; nefastis is a nut , forget it , a sincere nut . the true sensitive is the one that can share in the man 's hallucinations , that 's all . how wonderful they might be to share . for fifteen minutes more she tried ; repeating , if you are there , whatever you are , show yourself to me , i need you , show yourself . but nothing happened . \" i 'm sorry , \" she called in , surprisingly about to cry with frustration , her voice breaking , \" it 's no use . \" nefastis came to her and put an arm around her shoulders . \" it 's ok , \" he said . \" please do n't cry . come on in on the couch . the news will be on any minute . we can do it there . \" it ? \" said oedipa . \" do it ? what ? \" have sexual intercourse , \" replied nefastis . \" maybe there 'll be something about china tonight . i like to do it while they talk about viet nam , but china is best of all . you think about all those chinese . te eming . that prof usion of life . it makes it sex ier , right ? \" gah , \" oedipa screamed , and fled , nefastis snapping his fingers through the dark rooms behind her in a hippy - di ppy , oh - go - ahead - then - chick fashion he had doubtless learned from watching the tv also . \" say hello to old stanley , \" he called as she pat tered down the steps into the street , fl ung a bab ush ka over her license plate and sc re e ched away down telegraph . she drove more or less automatically until a swift boy in a mustang , perhaps unable to contain the new sense of vi ri lity his auto gave him , nearly killed her and she realized that she was on the freeway , heading ir re ver sibly for the bay bridge . it was the middle of rush hour . oedipa was appalled at the spectacle , having thought such traffic only possible in los angeles , places like that . looking down at san francisco a few minutes later from the high point of the bridge 's arc , she saw smog . haze , she corrected herself , is what it is , haze . how can they have smog in san francisco ? smog , according to the folklore , did not begin till farther south . it had to be the angle of the sun . amid the exhaust , sweat , glare and ill - humor of a summer evening on an american freeway , oedipa maas pon dered her trystero problem . all the silence of san nar c iso the calm surface of the motel pool , the cont em pla tive cont ours of residential streets like ra kings in the sand of a japanese garden had not allowed her to think as lei surely as this freeway madness . for john nefastis ( to take a recent example ) two kinds of entropy , thermodynamic and informational , happened , say by coincidence , to look alike , when you wrote them down as equations . yet he had made his mere coincidence respectable , with the help of maxwell 's demon . now here was oedipa , faced with a metaphor of god knew how many parts ; more than two , anyway . with coincidences blossom ing these days wherever she looked , she had nothing but a sound , a word , trystero , a to hold them together . she knew a few things about it : it had opposed the thurn and taxis postal system in europe ; its symbol was a muted post horn ; sometime before it had appeared in america and fought the pony express and wells , fargo , either as outlaws in black , or disguised as indians ; and it survived today , in california , serving as a channel of communication for those of unorthodox sexual persuasion , inventors who believed in the reality of maxwell 's demon , possibly her own husband , mucho maas ( but she 'd thrown mucho 's letter long away , there was no way for genghis cohen to check the stamp , so if she wanted to find out for sure she 'd have to ask mucho himself ) . either trystero did exist , in its own right , or it was being presumed , perhaps f ant asi ed by oedipa , so hung up on and inter penetrated with the dead man 's estate . here in san francisco , away from all tangible assets of that estate , there might still be a chance of getting the whole thing to go away and dis integrate quietly . she had only to drift tonight , at random , and watch nothing happen , to be convinced it was purely nervous , a little something for her shrink to fix . she got off the freeway at north beach , drove around , parked finally in a steep side - street among ware houses . then walked along broadway , into the first crowds of evening . but it took her no more than an hour to catch sight of a muted post horn . she was mo se ying along a street full of aging boys in ro os atkins suits when she col li ded with a gang of guided tourists come row dy - do wing out of a volkswagen bus , on route to take in a few san francisco nite spots . \" let me lay this on you , \" a voice spoke into her ear , \" because i just left , \" and she found being def tly pinned out board of one breast this big cer ise id badge , reading hi ! my name is arnold s nar b ! and i 'm lookin ' for a good time ! oedipa glanced around and saw a cher u bic face vanishing with a wink in among natural shoulders and striped shirts , and away went arnold s nar b , looking for a better time . somebody blew on an athletic whistle and oedipa found herself being her ded , along with other bad ged citizens , toward a bar called the greek way . oh , no , oedipa thought , not a fag joint , no ; and for a minute tried to fight out of the human surge , before recalling how she had decided to drift tonight . \" now in here , \" their guide , s we ating dark tentacles into his tab collar , brief ed them , \" you are going to see the members of the third sex , the lavender crowd this city by the bay is so justly famous for . to some of you the experience may seem a little queer , but remember , try not to act like a bunch of tourists . if you get pro positioned it 'll all be in fun , just part of the gay night life to be found here in famous north beach . two drinks and when you hear the whistle it means out , on the double , re group right here . if you 're well behaved we 'll hit fin oc chio 's next . \" he blew the whistle twice and the tourists , breaking into a yell , swept oedipa inside , in a f ren zied assault on the bar . when things had calmed she was near the door with an uni den ti fiable drink in her fist , jam med against somebody tall in a suede sport coat . in the la pel of which she sp ied , wrought ex qui si tely in some pale , gli m mer ing alloy , not another cer ise badge , but a pin in the shape of the trystero post horn . mute and everything . all right , she told herself . you lose . a game try , all one hour 's worth . she should have left then and gone back to berkeley , to the hotel . but could n't . \" what if i told you , \" she addressed the owner of the pin , \" that i was an agent of thurn and taxis ? \" what , \" he answered , \" some theatrical agency ? \" he had large ears , hair cropped nearly to his sc al p , ac ne on his face , and curiously empty eyes , which now s wi vel ed briefly to oedipa 's breasts . \" how 'd you get a name like arnold s nar b ? \" if you tell me where you got your la pel pin , \" said oedipa . \" sorry . \" she sought to bug him : \" if it 's a homosexual sign or something , that does n't bother me . \" eyes showing nothing : \" i do n't swing that way , \" he said . \" yours either . \" turned his back on her and ordered a drink . oedipa took off her badge , put it in an ash tray and said , quietly , trying not to suggest hysteria , \" look , you have to help me . because i really think i am going out of my head . \" you have the wrong outfit , arnold . talk to your clergy man . \" i use the u . s . mail because i was never taught any different , \" she pleaded . \" but i 'm not your enemy . i do n't want to be . \" what about my friend ? \" he came spinning around on the sto ol to face her again . \" you want to be that , arnold ? \" i do n't know , \" she thought she 'd better say . he looked at her , blank . \" what do you know ? \" she told him everything . why not ? held nothing back . at the end of it the tourists had been wh i st led away and he 'd bought two rounds to oedipa 's three . \" i 'd heard about ' kirby , ' \" he said , \" it 's a code name , nobody real . but none of the rest , your sin ophile across the bay , or that sick play . i never thought there was a history to it . \" i think of nothing but , \" she said , and a little plain tive . \" and , \" scratching the stu bble on his head , \" you have nobody else to tell this to . only somebody in a bar whose name you do n't know ? \" she would n't look at him . \" i guess not . \" no husband , no shrink ? \" both , \" oedipa said , \" but they do n't know . \" you ca n't tell them ? \" she met his eyes ' void for a second after all , and shrugged . \" i 'll tell you what i know , then , \" he decided . \" the pin i 'm wearing means i 'm a member of the ia . that 's in amor ati anonymous . an in amor ato is somebody in love . that 's the worst addiction of all . \" somebody is about to fall in love , \" oedipa said , \" you go sit with them , or something ? \" right . the whole idea is to get to where you do n't need it . i was lucky . i kicked it young . but there are sixty - year - old men , believe it or not , and women even older , who wake up in the night screaming . \" \" you hold meetings , then , like the aa ? \" \" no , of course not . you get a phone number , an answering service you can call . nobody knows anybody else 's name ; just the number in case it gets so bad you ca n't handle it alone . we 're is ol ates , arnold . meetings would destroy the whole point of it . \" what about the person who comes to sit with you ? suppose you fall in love with them ? \" they go away , \" he said . \" you never see them twice . the answering service dispatches them , and they 're careful not to have any repeats . \" how did the post horn come in ? that went back to their founding . in the early ' o 's a yo yo dyne executive living near l . a . and located someplace in the corporate root - system above supervisor but below vice - president , found himself , at age , automated out of a job . having been since age rigidly instructed in an eschatology that pointed nowhere but to a presidency and death , trained to do absolutely nothing but sign his name to specialized mem or anda he could not begin to understand to take blame for the running - amok of specialized programs that failed for specialized reasons he had to have explained to him , the executive 's first thoughts were naturally of suicide . but previous training got the better of him : he could not make the decision without first hearing the ideas of a committee . he placed an ad in the personal column of the l . a . times , asking whether anyone who 'd been in the same fix had ever found any good reasons for not committing suicide . his sh re wd assumption being that no suicides would reply , leaving him automatically with only valid inputs . the assumption was false . after a week of an xi ously watching the mailbox through little japanese bin o c ul ars his wife had given him for a going - away present ( she 'd left him the day after he was pink - slipped ) and getting nothing but sucker - list stuff through the regular deliveries that came each noon , he was j ol ted out of a boo zy , black - and - white dream of jumping off the stack into rush - hour traffic , by an insistent banging at the door . it was late on a sunday afternoon . he opened his door and found an aged bum with a knit ted watch cap on his head and a hook for a hand , who presented him with a bundle of letters and lo ped away without a word . most of the letters were from suicides who had failed , either through cl um siness or last - minute cowardice . none of them , however , could offer any compelling reasons for staying alive . still the executive di thered : spent another week with pieces of paper on which he would list , in columns headed \" pro \" and \" con , \" reasons for and against taking his bro dy . he found it impossible , in the absence of some trigger , to come to any clear decision . finally one day he noticed a front page story in the times , complete with ap wi rep ho to , about a buddhist monk in viet nam who had set himself on fire to protest government policies . \" gro ov y ! \" cried the executive . he went to the garage , sip honed all the gasoline from his bu ick 's tank , put on his green zachary all suit with the vest , stuffed all his letters from unsuccessful suicides into a coat pocket , went in the kitchen , sat on the floor , proceeded to dou se himself good with the gasoline . he was about to make the farewell flick of the wheel on his faithful zip po , which had seen him through the nor many hed ger o ws , the ar den nes , germany , and postwar america , when he heard a key in the front door , and voices . it was his wife and some man , whom he soon recognized as the very efficiency expert at yo yo dyne who had caused him to be replaced by an ibm . intrigued by the irony of it , he sat in the kitchen and listened , leaving his neck tie di pped in the gasoline as a sort of wick . from what he could gather , the efficiency expert wished to have sexual intercourse with the wife on the moroccan rug in the living room . the wife was not unwilling . the executive heard le wd laughter , zip pers , the thum p of shoes , heavy breathing , mo ans . he took his tie out of the gasoline and started to s nigger . he closed the top on his zip po . \" i hear laughing , \" his wife said presently . \" i smell gasoline , \" said the efficiency expert . hand in hand , naked , the two proceeded to the kitchen . \" i was about to do the buddhist monk thing , \" explained the executive . \" nearly three weeks it takes him , \" marvel led the efficiency expert , \" to decide . you know how long it would 've taken the ibm ? twelve micro seconds . no wonder you were replaced . \" the executive threw back his head and laughed for a solid ten minutes , along toward the middle of which his wife and her friend , alarmed , retired , got dressed and went out looking for the police . the executive un dressed , sho wered and hung his suit out on the line to dry . then he noticed a curious thing . the stamps on some of the letters in his suit pocket had turned almost white . he realized that the gasoline must have dissolved the printing ink . idly , he pe eled off a stamp and saw suddenly the image of the muted post horn , the skin of his hand showing clearly through the watermark . \" a sign , \" he wh is pered , \" is what it is . \" if he 'd been a religious man he would have fallen to his knees . as it was , he only declared , with great sole m nity : \" my big mistake was love . from this day i swear to stay off of love : he ter o , homo , bi , dog or cat , car , every kind there is . i will found a society of is ol ates , dedicated to this purpose , and this sign , revealed by the same gasoline that almost destroyed me , will be its emblem . \" and he did . oedipa , by now rather drunk , said , \" where is he now ? \" he 's anonymous , \" said the anonymous in amor ato . \" why not write to him through your waste system ? say ' founder , ia . ' \" but i do n't know how to use it , \" she said . \" think of it , \" he went on , also drunk . \" a whole underworld of suicides who failed . all keeping in touch through that secret delivery system . what do they tell each other ? \" he shook his head , smiling , stumbled off his sto ol and headed off to take a leak , disappearing into the dense crowd . he did n't come back . oedipa sat , feeling as alone as she ever had , now the only woman , she saw , in a room full of drunken male homosexuals . story of my life , she thought , mucho wo n't talk to me , hilarius wo n't listen , clerk maxwell did n't even look at me , and this group , god knows . despair came over her , as it will when nobody around has any sexual relevance to you . she gau ged the spectrum of feeling out there as running from really violent hate ( an indian - looking kid hardly out of his teens , with fro sted shoulder - length hair tucked behind his ears and pointed cowboy boots ) to dry speculation ( a horn ri mmed ss type who stared at her legs , trying to figure out if she was in drag ) , none of which could do her any good . so she got up after awhile and left the greek way , and entered the city again , the infected city . and spent the rest of the night finding the image of the trystero post horn . in chinatown , in the dark window of a her bal ist , she thought she saw it on a sign among ide ographs . but the street light was dim . later , on a sidewalk , she saw two of them in chalk , feet apart . between them a complicated array of boxes , some with letters , some with numbers . a kids ' game ? places on a . map , dates from a secret history ? she copied the diagram in her memo book . when she looked up , a man , perhaps a man , in a black suit , was standing in a door way half a block away , watching her . she thought she saw a turned - around collar but took no chances ; headed back the way she 'd come , pulse thunder ing . a bus stopped at the next corner , and she ran to catch it . she stayed with buses after that , getting off only now and then to walk so she 'd keep awake . what fragments of dreams came had to do with the post horn . later , possibly , she would have trouble sorting the night into real and dreamed . at some indefinite passage in night 's son orous score , it also came to her that she would be safe , that something , perhaps only her linearly fading dr un ken ness , would protect her . the city was hers , as , made up and sle e ked so with the customary words and images ( cosmopolitan , culture , cable cars ) it had not been before : she had safe - passage tonight to its far blood 's bran ch ings , be they cap ill aries too small for more than pe ering into , or vessels m ashed together in shameless municipal hic keys , out on the skin for all but tourists to see . nothing of the night 's could touch her ; nothing did . the repetition of symbols was to be enough , without trauma as well perhaps to at ten u ate it or even jar it altogether loose from her memory . she was meant to remember . she faced that possibility as she might the toy street from a high balcony , roller - coaster ride , feeding - time among the beasts in a zoo any death - wish that can be con sum mated by some minimum gesture . she touched the edge of its vol up tuous field , knowing it would be lovely beyond dreams simply to submit to it ; that not gravity 's pull , laws of ballistics , feral raven ing , promised more delight . she tested it , shi vering : i am meant to remember . each clue that comes is supposed to have its own clarity , its fine chances for per man ence . but then she wondered if the gem like \" clues \" were only some kind of compensation . to make up . for her having lost the direct , epi lep tic word , the cry that might abolish the night . in golden gate park she came on a circle of children in their night clothes , who told her they were dreaming the gathering . but that the dream was really no different from being awake , because in the mor nings when they got up they felt tired , as if they 'd been up most of the night . when their mothers thought they were out playing they were really cur led in cup boards of neighbors ' houses , in platforms up in trees , in secretly - hol lowed nests inside hedges , sleeping , making up for these hours . the night was empty of all terror for them , they had inside their circle an imaginary fire , and needed nothing but their own un penetrated sense of community . they knew about the post horn , but nothing of the chal ked game oedipa had seen on the sidewalk . you used only one image and it was a jump - rope game , a little girl explained : you stepped alternately in the loop , the bell , and the mute , while your girlfriend sang : tri stoe , one , two , three , turning taxi from across the sea . \" thurn and taxis , you mean ? \" they 'd never heard it that way . went on warming their hands at an invisible fire . oedipa , to retaliate , stopped believing in them . in an all - night mexican greasy spoon off th , she found a piece of her past , in the form of one jesus ar r ab al , who was sitting in a corner under the tv set , idly stirring his bowl of opaque soup with the foot of a chicken . \" hey , \" he greeted oedipa , \" you were the lady in ma z at lan . \" he beck oned her to sit . \" you remember everything , \" oedipa said , \" jesus ; even tourists . how is your cia ? \" standing not for the agency you think , but for a clandestine mexican outfit known as the con jur ation de los in sur gen tes an ar quis - tas , traceable back to the time of the flores mag n brothers and later briefly allied with zap ata . \" you see . in exile , \" waving his arm around at the place . he was part - owner here with a y uc at eco who still believed in the revolution . their revolution . \" and you . are you still with that gr ingo who spent too much money on you ? the oli gar chist , the miracle ? \" \" he died . \" ah , po bre cito . \" they had met jesus ar r ab al on the beach , where he had previously announced an anti - government rally . nobody had showed up . so he fell to talking to in ver arity , the enemy he must , to be true to his faith , learn . pierce , because of his neutral manners when in the presence of ill - will , had nothing to tell ar r ab al ; he played the rich , obnoxious gr ingo so perfectly that oedipa had seen goose flesh come up along the anarchist 's fore arms , due to no pacific sea - breeze . soon as pierce went off to sport in the surf , ar r ab al asked her if he was real , or a spy , or making fun of him . oedipa did n't understand . \" yon know what a miracle is . not what bak un in said . but another world 's intrusion into this one . most of the time we coexist peacefully , but when we do touch there 's cat ac ly sm . like the church we hate , anarchists also believe in another world . where revolutions break out spontaneous and leader less , and the soul 's talent for consensus allows the masses to work together without effort , automatic as the body itself . and yet , sena , if any of it should ever really happen that perfectly , i would also have to cry miracle . an anarchist miracle . like your friend . he is too exactly and without flaw the thing we fight . in mexico the pri vi le gi ado is always , to a finite percentage , re deemed one of the people . un miraculous . but your friend , unless he 's joking , is as terrifying to me as a virgin appearing to an indian . \" in the years intervening oedipa had remembered jesus because he 'd seen that about pierce and she had n't . as if he were , in some un sexual way , competition . now , drinking thick luke warm coffee from a clay pot on the back burner of the y uc at eco 's stove and listening to jesus talk conspiracy , she wondered if , without the miracle of pierce to reassure him , jesus might not have quit his cia eventually and gone over like everybody else to the majority pri ist as , and so never had to go into exile . the dead man , like maxwell 's demon , was the linking feature in a coincidence . without him neither she nor jesus would be exactly here , exactly now . it was enough , a coded warning . what , tonight , was chance ? so her eyes did fall presently onto an ancient rolled copy of the anarcho - syn di cal ist paper re gen er aci dn . the date was and there was no stamp next to the cancellation , only the hand struck image of the post horn . \" they arrive , \" said ar r ab al . \" have they been in the mails that long ? has my name been substituted for that of a member who 's died ? has it really taken sixty years ? is it a reprint ? idle questions , i am a foot soldier . the higher levels have their reasons . \" she carried this thought back out into the night with her . down at the city beach , long after the pizza stands and rides had closed , she walked un molested through a dri fting , dream y cloud of de lin qu ents in summer - weight gang jackets with the post horn sti t ched on in thread that looked pure silver in what moonlight there was . they had all been smoking , s nu ffing or injecting something , and perhaps did not see her at all . riding among an exhausted bus ful of negroes going on to graveyard shifts all over the city , she saw scratched on the back of a seat , shining for her in the brilliant smo ky interior , the post horn with the legend death . but unlike waste , somebody had troubled to write in , in pencil : do n't ever antagonize the horn . somewhere near fillmore she found the symbol tacked to the bulletin board of a la un dro mat , among other sc ra ps of paper offering cheap iron ing and baby sit ters . if you know what this means , the note said , you know where to find out more . around her the odor of chlorine bleach rose he av en ward , like an in cen se . machines chu gged and slo shed fiercely . except for oedipa the place was deserted , and the flu ore scent bulbs seemed to shri ek whiteness , to which everything their light touched was dedicated . it was a negro neighborhood . was the horn so dedicated ? would it antagonize the horn to ask ? who could she ask ? in the buses all night she listened to transistor radios playing songs in the lower stretches of the top , that would never become popular , whose melodies and lyrics would perish as if they had never been sung . a mexican girl , trying to hear one of these through s nar ling static from the bus 's motor , hum med along as if she would remember it always , tracing post horns and hearts with a finger nail , in the haze of her breath on the window . out at the airport oedipa , feeling invisible , e aves dropped on a poker game whose steady loser entered each loss neat and conscientious in a little balance - book decorated inside with sc ra w led post horns . \" i 'm averaging a . percent return , fellas , \" she heard him say . the others , strangers , looked at him , some blank , some annoyed . \" that 's averaging it out , over years , \" he went on , trying a smile . \" always just that little percent on the wrong side of breaking even . twenty - three years . i 'll never get ahead of it . why do n't i quit ? \" nobody answering . in one of the lat r ines was an advertisement by ac - dc , standing for alam eda county death cult , along with a box number and post horn . once a month they were to choose some victim from among the innocent , the vir tu ous , the socially integrated and well - adjusted , using him sexually , then sacrificing him . oedipa did not copy the number . catching a twa flight to miami was an un coordinated boy who planned to slip at night into aqu ari ums and open negotiations with the dolphins , who would succeed man . he was kissing his mother passionately goodbye , using his tongue . \" i 'll write , ma , \" he kept saying . \" write by waste , \" she said , \" remember . the government will open it if you use the other . the dolphins will be mad . \" \" i love you , ma , \" he said . \" love the dolphins , \" she advised him . \" write by waste . \" so it went . oedipa played the vo ye ur and listener . among her other encounters were a fac i ally - deformed wel der , who cherished his ug liness ; a child roaming the night who missed the death before birth as certain out casts do the dear l ul ling bl an k ness of the community ; a negro woman with an in tri c ately - mar bled scar along the baby - fat of one cheek who kept going through rituals of miscarriage each for a different reason , deliberately as others might the ritual of birth , dedicated not to continuity but to some kind of inter re gn um ; an aging night - watch man , ni bbling at a bar of ivory soap , who had trained his vir tu oso stomach to accept also lo tions , air - fresh en ers , f ab ri cs , to b acc oes and wa xes in a hopeless attempt to assimilate it all , all the promise , productivity , betrayal , ul cers , before it was too late ; and even another vo ye ur , who hung outside one of the city 's still - lighted windows , searching for who knew what specific image . de cor ating each alienation , each species of withdrawal , as cu ff link , decal , aim less do od ling , there was somehow always the post horn . she grew so to expect it that perhaps she did not see it quite as often as she later was to remember seeing it . a couple - three times would really have been enough . or too much . she bus rode and walked on into the lightening morning , giving herself up to a fat alism rare for her . where was the oedipa who 'd driven so bravely up here from san narciso ? that optimistic baby had come on so like the private eye in any long - ago radio drama , believing all you needed was gr it , resource fulness , exemption from hi deb ound cops ' rules , to solve any great mystery . but the private eye sooner or later has to get beat up on . this night 's prof usion of post horns , this malignant , deliberate replication , was their way of beating up . they knew her pressure points , and the gang lia of her optimism , and one by one , pinch by precision pinch , they were im mo bi li zing her . last night , she might have wondered what under grounds apart from the couple she knew of communicated by waste system . by sunrise she could legitimately ask what under grounds did n't . if miracles were , as jesus ar r ab al had postulated years ago on the beach at ma z at lan , intrusions into this world from another , a kiss of cosmic pool balls , then so must be each of the night 's post horns . for here were god knew how many citizens , deliberately choosing not to communicate by u . s . mail . it was not an act of treason , nor possibly even of defiance . but it was a calculated withdrawal , from the life of the republic , from its machinery . whatever else was being denied them out of hate , indifference to the power of their vote , loopholes , simple ignorance , this withdrawal was their own , un - publicized , private . since they could not have withdrawn into a vacuum ( could they ? ) , there had to exist the separate , silent , un suspected world . just before the morning rush hour , she got out of a jit ney whose ancient driver ended each day in the red , downtown on howard street , began to walk toward the em bar cad ero . she knew she looked terrible knuckles black with eye - liner and mas cara from where she 'd ru bb ed , mouth tasting of old boo ze and coffee . through an open door way , on the st air leading up into the dis in fec tant - smelling twilight of a room ing house she saw an old man hu ddled , shaking with grief she could n't hear . both hands , smoke - white , covered his face . on the back of the left hand she made out the post horn , tat to oed in old ink now beginning to blur and spread . fascinated , she came into the shadows and ascended c re aking steps , he si tating on each one . when she was three steps from him the hands flew apart and his wrecked face , and the terror of eyes gl ori ed in burst veins , stopped her . \" can i help ? \" she was shaking , tired . \" my wife 's in fresno , \" he said . he wore an old double - bre a sted suit , fra yed gray shirt , wide tie , no hat . \" i left her . so long ago , i do n't remember . now this is for her . \" he gave oedipa a letter that looked like he 'd been carrying it around for years . \" drop it in the , \" and he held up the tattoo and stared into her eyes , \" you know . i ca n't go out there . it 's too far now , i had a bad night . \" i know , \" she said . \" but i 'm new in town . i do n't know where it is . \" under the freeway . \" he wa ved her on in the direction she 'd been going . \" always one . you 'll see it . \" the eyes closed . cam med each night out of that safe fur row the bulk of this city 's waking each sunrise again set vir tu ously to plowing , what rich so ils had he turned , what con centric planets uncovered ? what voices overheard , flinders of lu min es cent gods gli mp sed among the wallpaper 's stained foliage , c and le stubs lit to rotate in the air over him , pre figuring the cigarette he or a friend must fall asleep someday smoking , thus to end among the flaming , secret salts held all those years by the in sa ti able stuffing of a mattress that could keep v esti ges of every nightmare sweat , helpless over flowing bl adder , viciously , tear fully con sum mated wet dream , like the memory bank to a computer of the lost ? she was overcome all at once by a need to touch him , as if she could not believe in him , or would not remember him , without it . exhausted , hardly knowing what she was doing , she came the last three steps and sat , took the man in her arms , actually held him , gazing out of her sm u dged eyes down the stairs , back into the morning . she felt we tness against her breast and saw that he was crying again . he hardly breath ed but tears came as if being pumped . \" i ca n't help , \" she wh is pered , rocking him , \" i ca n't help . \" it was already too many miles to fresno . \" is that him ? \" a voice asked behind her , up the stairs . \" the sailor ? \" he has a tattoo on his hand . \" can you bring him up ok ? that 's him . \" she turned and saw an even older man , shorter , wearing a tall hom burg hat and smiling at them . \" i 'd help you but i got a little arthritis . \" does he have to come up ? \" she said . \" up there ? \" where else , lady ? \" she did n't know . she let go of him for a moment , reluctant as if he were her own child , and he looked up at her . \" come on , \" she said . he reached out the tat to oed hand she took that , and that was how they went the rest of the way up that flight , and then the two more : hand in hand , very slowly for the man with arthritis . \" he disappeared last night , \" he told her . \" said he was going looking for his old lady . it 's a thing he does , off and on . \" they entered a warren of rooms and cor ri dors , lit by lo - watt bulbs , separated by beaver board partitions . the old man followed them stiff ly . at last he said , \" here . \" in the little room were another suit , a couple of religious tracts , a rug , a chair . a picture of a saint , changing well - water to oil for jerusalem 's easter lamps . another bulb , dead . the bed . the mattress , waiting . she ran through then a scene she might play . she might find the landlord of this place , and bring him to court , and buy the sailor a new suit at ro os atkins , and shirt , and shoes , and give him the bus fare to fresno after all . but with a sigh he had released her hand , while she was so lost in the fantasy that she had n't felt it go away , as if he 'd known the best moment to let go . \" just mail the letter , \" he said , \" the stamp is on it . \" she looked and saw the familiar car mine air mail , with a jet flying by the capitol dome . but at the top of the dome stood a tiny figure in deep black , with its arms out stretched . oedipa was n't sure what exactly was supposed to be on top of the capitol , but knew it was n't anything like that . \" please , \" the sailor said . \" go on now . you do n't want to stay here . \" she looked in her purse , found a ten and a single , gave him the ten . \" i 'll spend it on boo ze , \" he said . \" remember your friends , \" said the ar th ritic , watching the ten . \" bitch , \" said the sailor . \" why did n't you wait till he was gone ? \" oedipa watched him make adjustments so he 'd fit easier against the mattress . that stuffed memory . regis - tera . \" give me a cigarette , ramirez , \" the sailor said . \" i know you got one . \" would it be today ? \" ramirez , \" she cried . the ar th ritic looked around on his rusty neck . \" he 's going to die , \" she said . \" who is n't ? \" said ramirez . she remembered john nefastis , talking about his machine , and massive de str uc tions of information . so when this mattress fla red up around the sailor , in his viking 's funeral : the stored , coded years of use lessness , early death , self - har rowing , the sure decay of hope , the set of all men who had slept on it , whatever their lives had been , would truly cease to be , forever , when the mattress burned . she stared at it in wonder . it was as if she had just discovered the irreversible process . it astonished her to think that so much could be lost , even the quantity of hall uc ination belonging just to the sailor that the world would bear no further trace of . she knew , because she had held him , that he suffered dt 's . behind the initials was a metaphor , a deli rium tre men s , a tre m bling un fur rowing of the mind 's p low share . the saint whose water can light lamps , the clair voy ant whose lapse in recall is the breath of god , the true paranoid for whom all is organized in spheres joy ful or threatening about the central pulse of himself , the dreamer whose puns probe ancient fe tid sha fts and tunnels of truth all act in the same special relevance to the word , or whatever it is the word is there , bu f fering , to protect us from . the act of metaphor then was a thrust at truth and a lie , depending where you were : inside , safe , or outside , lost . oedipa did not know where she was . tre m bling , un fur ro wed , she slipped side wise , sc re e ching back across grooves of years , to hear again the earnest , high voice of her second or third collegiate love ray g lo zing bitching among \" u hs \" and the syn cop ated ton guing of a cavity , about his freshman calculus ; \" dt , \" god help this old tat to oed man , meant also a time differential , a van ishingly small instant in which change had to be confronted at last for what it was , where it could no longer disguise itself as something innocuous like an average rate ; where velocity d wel led in the projectile though the projectile be frozen in mid flight , where death d wel led in the cell though the cell be looked in on at its most quick . she knew that the sailor had seen worlds no other man had seen if only because there was that high magic to low puns , because dt 's must give access to dt 's of spectra beyond the known sun , music made purely of antarctic lone liness and f right . but nothing she knew of would preserve them , or him . she gave him goodbye , walked down stairs and then on , in the direction he 'd told her . for an hour she pro w led among the sun less , concrete under pin nings of the freeway , finding dr un ks , bu ms , pede strians , pe der asts , hook ers , walking psychotic , no secret mailbox . but at last in the shadows she did come on a can with a swinging tra pe zo idal top , the kind you throw trash in : old and green , nearly four feet high . on the swinging part were hand - painted the initials w . a . s . t . e . she had to look closely to see the periods between the letters . oedipa settled back in the shadow of a column . she may have do zed off . she woke to see a kid dropping a bundle of letters into - the can . she went over and dropped in the sailor 's letter to fresno ; then hid again and waited . toward mid day a rang y young win o showed up with a sack ; unlocked a panel at the side of the box and took out all the letters . oedipa gave him half a block 's start , then began to tail him . congratulating herself on having thought to wear flats , at least . the carrier led her across market then over toward city hall . in a street close enough to the dra b , stone openness of the civic center to be infected by its gray , he ren de z v ou sed with another carrier , and they exchanged sacks . oedipa decided to stick with the one she 'd been following . she tailed him all the way back down the littered , shi fty , loud length of market and over on first street to the trans - bay bus terminal , where he bought a ticket for oakland . so did oedipa . they rode over the bridge and into the great , empty glare of the oakland afternoon . the landscape lost all variety . the carrier got off in a neighborhood oedipa could n't identify . she followed him for hours along streets whose names she never knew , across ar teri - als that even with the afternoon 's lu ll nearly murdered her , into sl ums and out , up long hill sides jam med solid with two - or three - bedroom houses , all their windows giving bl an kly back only the sun . one by one his sack of letters emptied . at length he climbed on a berkeley bus . oedipa followed . halfway up telegraph the carrier got off and led her down the street to a pseudo - mexican apartment house . not once had he looked behind him . john nefastis lived here . she was back where she 'd started , and could not believe hours had passed . should it have been more or less ? back in the hotel she found the lobby full of deaf - mute delegates in party hats , copied in c re pe paper after the fur chinese communist jobs made popular during the korean conflict . they were every one of them drunk , and a few of the men grabbed her , thinking to bring her along to a party in the grand ballroom . she tried to struggle out of the silent , gest uring swarm , but was too weak . her legs ached , her mouth tasted horrible . they swept her on into the ballroom , where she was seized about the waist by a handsome young man in a harris t we ed coat and wal t zed round and round , through the ru stling , shuffling hush , under a great un lit chan deli er . each couple on the floor danced whatever was in the fellow 's head : tango , two - step , bo ssa nova , slo p . but how long , oedipa thought , could it go on before collisions became a serious hindrance ? there would have to be collisions . the only alternative was some unthinkable order of music , many rhythms , all keys at once , a chore ography in which each couple mes hed easy , pre destined . something they all heard with an extra sense at ro phi ed in herself . she followed her partner 's lead , limp in the young mute 's cl asp , waiting for the collisions to begin . but none came . she was danced for half an hour before , by mysterious consensus , everybody took a break , without having felt any touch but the touch of her partner . jesus ar r ab al would have called it an anarchist miracle . oedipa , with no name for it , was only de mor alized . she cur tsi ed and fled . next day , after twelve hours of sleep and no dreams to speak of , oedipa checked out of the hotel and drove down the peninsula to kin ne ret . she had decided on route , with time to think about the day preceding , to go see dr hilarius her shrink , and tell him all . she might well be in the cold and sweat less me a tho o ks of a psychosis . with her own eyes she had verified a waste system : seen two waste post men , a waste mailbox , waste stamps , waste cancel lations . and the image of the muted post horn all but s atur ating the bay area . yet she wanted it all to be f ant as y some clear result of her several wounds , needs , dark doubles . she wanted hilarius to tell her she was some kind of a nut and needed a rest , and that there was no trystero . she also wanted to know why the chance of its being real should menace her so . she pulled into the drive at hilarius 's clinic a little after sunset . the light in his office did n't seem to be on . e uc al y p tus branches blew in a great stream of air that flowed downhill , sucked to the evening sea . halfway along the flag stone path , she was star tled by an insect wh ir ring loudly past her ear , followed at once by the sound of a gun shot . that was no insect , thought oedipa , at which point , hearing another shot , she made the connection . in the fading light she was a clear target ; the only way to go was toward the clinic . she d ashed up to the glass doors , found them locked , the lobby inside dark . oedipa picked up a rock next to a flower bed and he a ved it at one of the doors . it b oun ced off . she was looking around for another rock when a white shape appeared inside , flu ttering up to the door and unlocking it for her . it was hel ga bl am m , hilarius 's sometime assistant . \" hurry , \" she chat tered , as oedipa slipped inside . the woman was close to hysterical . \" what 's happening ? \" oedipa said . \" he 's gone crazy . i tried to call the police , but he took a chair and smashed the switch board with it . \" dr hilarius ? \" he thinks someone 's after him . \" tear streaks had mean dered down over the nurse 's che ek bones . \" he 's locked himself in the office with that rifle . \" a ge wehr , from the war , oedipa recalled , that he kept as a sou ven ir . \" he shot at me . do you think anybody will report it ? \" well he 's shot at half a dozen people , \" replied nurse bl am m , leading oedipa down a corridor to her office . \" somebody better report it . \" oedipa noticed that the window opened on a safe line of retreat . \" you could 've run , \" she said . bl am m , running hot water from a wash basin tap into cups and stirring in instant coffee , looked up , qui zz ical . \" he might need somebody . \" who 's supposed to be after him ? \" three men with sub machine guns , he said . terrorists , fanatics , that was all i got . he started breaking up the pbx . \" she gave oedipa a hostile look . \" too many nutty bro ads , that 's what did it . kin ne ret is full of nothing but . he could n't cope . \" i 've been away for a while , \" oedipa said . \" maybe i could find out what it is . maybe i 'd be less of a threat for him . \" bl am m burned her mouth on the coffee . \" start telling him your troubles and he 'll probably shoot you . \" in front of his door , which she could never remember having seen closed , oedipa stood hip shot awhile , questioning her own sanity . why had n't she split out through bl am m 's window and read about the rest of it in the paper ? \" who is it ? \" hilarius screamed , having picked up her breathing , or something . \" mrs maas . \" may speer and his ministry of cretins rot eternally in hell . do you realize that half these rounds are du ds ? \" may i come in ? could we talk ? \" i 'm sure you 'd all like that , \" hilarius said . \" i 'm unarmed . you can fri sk me . \" while you karate -

c lo aked riders , who engaged them in a fierce , silent struggle in the icy wind blowing in from the lake . the mar au ders used cu dg els , har que buses , swords , sti let tos , at the end silk ker chiefs to dispatch those still breathing . all except for dr blo bb and his servant , who had dis so ci ated themselves from the hassle at the very outset , proclaimed in loud voices that they were british subjects , and even from time to time \" ventured to sing certain of the more improving of our church hymns . \" their escape surprised oedipa , in view of what seemed to be trystero 's passion for security . \" was trystero trying to set up shop in england ? \" bortz suggested , days later . oedipa did n't know . \" but why spare an in suffer able ass like dio cle tian blo bb ? \" you can spot a mouth like that a mile off , \" bortz said . \" even in the cold , even with your blood -

year - old pamphlet on the roots of modern anarchism , a book of sermons by blo bb 's brother augustine also among bortz 's wh ar finger iana , along with blo bb 's original clues , oedipa was able to fit together this account of how the organization began : in , the northern provinces of the low countries , led by the protestant noble william of orange , had been struggling nine years for independence from catholic spain and a catholic holy roman emperor . in late december , orange , de facto master of the low countries , entered brussels in triumph , having been invited there by a committee of eighteen . this was a junta of calvinist fanatics who felt that the estates - general , controlled by the privileged classes , no longer represented the skilled workers , had lost touch entirely with the people . the committee set up a kind of brussels commune . they controlled the police , dictated all decisions of the estates - general , and threw out many holders of high position in brussels . among these was leonard i , baron of taxis , gentleman of the emperor 's privy chamber and baron of buy singh en , the hereditary grand master of the post for the low countries , and executor of the thurn and taxis monopoly . he was replaced by one jan hin ck art , lord of o hain , a loyal adherent of orange . at this point the founding figure enters the scene : her nan do joaquin de tristero y cal aver a , perhaps a madman , perhaps an honest rebel , according to some only a con artist . tristero claimed to be jan hin ck art 's cousin , from the spanish and legitimate branch of the family , and true lord of o hain rightful heir to everything jan hin ck art then possessed , including his recent appointment as grand master . from until alexander far n ese took brussels back again for the emperor in march , , tristero kept up what amounted to a guerrilla war against his c ou sin if hin ck art was his cousin . being spanish , he got little support . most of the time , from one quarter or another , his life was in danger . still , he tried four times to assassinate orange 's post master , though without success . jan hin ck art was dis pos sessed by far n ese , and leonard i , the thurn and taxis grand master , rein - stated . but it had been a time of great instability for the thurn and taxis monopoly . le ery of strong protestant leanings in the bohemian branch of the family , the emperor , rudolph ii , had for a time withdrawn his patronage . the postal operation pl un ged deeply into the red . it may have been some vision of the continent - wide power structure hin ck art could have taken over , now momentarily weakened and to ttering , that inspired tristero to set up his own system . he seems to have been highly unstable , apt at any time to appear at a public function and begin a speech . his constant theme , dis inheritance . the postal monopoly belonged to o hain by right of conquest , and o hain belonged to tristero by right of blood . he styled himself el de she - red ado , the dis inherited , and fashioned a livery of black for his followers , black to sym bo li ze the only thing that truly belonged to them in their exile : the night . soon he had added to his icon ography the muted post horn and a dead badger with its four feet in the air ( some said that the name taxis came from the italian tas so , badger , referring to hats of badger fur the early ber gam as can c ou ri ers wore ) . he began a sub rosa campaign of obstruction , terror and de predation along the thurn and taxis mail routes . oedipa spent the next several days in and out of libraries and earnest discussions with emory bortz and genghis cohen . she feared a little for their security in view of what was happening to everyone else she knew . the day after reading blo bb 's pere grin ations she , with bortz , grace , and the graduate students , attended randolph driblette 's burial , listened to a younger brother 's helpless , stricken eulogy , watched the mother , spectral in afternoon smog , cry , and came back at night to sit on the grave and drink napa valley mus cate l , which driblette in his time had put away barrels of . there was no moon , smog covered the stars , all black as a tristero rider . oedipa sat on the earth , ass getting cold , wondering whether , as driblette had suggested that night from the shower , some version of herself had n't vanished with him . perhaps her mind would go on f le xing psychic muscles that no longer existed ; would be betrayed and mocked by a phantom self as the am pu tee is by a phantom limb . someday she might replace whatever of her had gone away by some pros thetic device , a dress of a certain color , a phrase in a ' letter , another lover . she tried to reach out , to whatever coded tenacity of protein might im probably have held on six feet below , still resisting de cay any stubborn qui es cence perhaps gathering itself for some last burst , some last scramble up through earth , just - gli m mer ing , holding together with its final strength a transient , winged shape , needing to settle at once in the warm host , or dis sip ate forever into the dark . if you come to me , prayed oedipa , bring your memories of the last night . or if you have to keep down your payload , the last five min u tes that may be enough . but so i 'll know if your walk into the sea had anything to do with tristero . if they got rid of you for the reason they got rid of hilarius and mucho and me tz ger maybe because they thought i no longer needed you . they were wrong . i needed you . only bring me that memory , and you can live with me for whatever time i 've got . she remembered his head , floating in the shower , saying , you could fall in love with me . but could she have saved him ? she looked over at the girl who 'd given her the news of his death . had they been in love ? did she know why driblette had put in those two extra lines that night ? had he even known why ? no one could begin to trace it . a hundred han gu ps , per muted , comb in ed sex , money , illness , despair with the history of his time and place , who knew . changing the script had no clearer motive than his suicide . there was the same whim sy to both . per hap s she felt briefly penetrated , as if the bright winged thing had actually made it to the sanctuary of her heart perhaps , sp r inging from the same slick labyrinth , adding those two lines had even , in a way never to be explained , served him as a re hear sal for his night 's walk away into that vast sink of the primal blood the pacific . she waited for the winged brightness to announce its safe arrival . but there was silence . driblette , she called . the signal echoing down twisted miles of brain cir cu i try . driblette ! but as with maxwell 's demon , so now . either she could not communicate , or he did not exist . beyond its origins , the libraries told her nothing more about tristero . for all they knew , it had never survived the struggle for dutch independence . to find the rest , she had to approach from the thum and taxis side . this had its per ils . for emory bortz it seemed to turn into a species of cute game . he held , for instance , to a mirror - image theory , by which any period of instability for thum and taxis must have its reflection in tristero 's shadow - state . he applied this to the mystery of why the dread name should have appeared in print only around the middle of the th century . how had the author of the pun on \" this trystero dies ira e \" overcome his reluctance ? how had half the vatican c ou plet , with its suppression of the \" trystero \" line , found its way into the folio ? whence had the daring of even hinting at a thurn and taxis rival come ? bortz maintained there must have been some crisis inside tristero grave enough to keep them from re tali ating . perhaps the same that kept them from taking the life of dr . blo bb . but should bortz have ex fo li ated the mere words so lus h ly , into such unnatural roses , under which , in whose red , sc en ted dusk , dark history s li thered unseen ? when leonard ii - francis , count of thum and taxis , died in , his wife alex and rine of rye succeeded him in name as post master , though her tenure was never considered official . she retired in . the actual locus of power in the monopoly remained uncertain until , when the next male heir , lam oral ii - claude - francis , took over . meanwhile , in brussels and antwerp signs of decay in the system had appeared . private local posts had enc ro ached so far on the imperial licenses that the two cities shut down their thurn and taxis offices . how , bortz asked , would tristero have responded ? post ulating then some militant faction proclaiming the great moment finally at hand . advocating a takeover by force , while their enemy was vulnerable . but conservative opinion would care only to continue in opposition , exactly as the tristero had these seventy years . there might also be , say , a few vision aries : men above the im m edi acy of their time who could think historically . at least one among them hip enough to foresee the end of the thirty years ' war , the peace of west ph alia , the breakup of the empire , the coming descent into p ar tic ul arism . \" he looks like kirk douglas , \" cried bortz , \" he 's wearing this sword , his name is something gut sy like konrad . they 're meeting in the back room of a tavern , all these bro ads in peasant bl ouses carrying ste ins around , everybody ju iced and yelling , suddenly konrad jumps up on a table . the crowd h us hes , ' the salvation of europe , ' konrad says , ' depends on communication , right ? we face this anarchy of jealous german princes , hundreds of them sch eming , counter -

' together , ' konrad is saying , ' our two systems could be invincible . we could refuse service on any but an imperial basis . nobody could move troops , farm produce , anything , without us . any prince tries to start his own courier system , we suppress it . we , who have so long been dis inherited , could be the heirs of europe ! ' prolonged cheering . \" but they did n't keep the empire from falling apart , \" oedipa pointed out . \" so , \" bortz backing off , \" the militants and the conservatives fight to a stand still , konrad and his little group of vision aries , being nice guys , try to mediate , the hassle , by the time they all get squared away again , everybody 's played out , the empire 's had it , thurn and taxis wants no deals . \" and with the end of the holy roman empire , the f oun tain head of thurn and taxis legitimacy is lost forever among the other splendid delusions . possibilities for paranoia become abundant . if tristero has managed to maintain even partial secrecy , if thurn and taxis have no clear idea who their adversary is , or how far its influence extends , then many of them must come to believe in something very like the sc ur v ham - ite 's blind , automatic anti - god . whatever it is , it has the power to murder their riders , send land slides thunder ing across their roads , by extension bring into being new local competition and presently even state postal mono poli es ; dis integrate their empire . it is their time 's ghost , out to put the thurn and taxis ass in a sling . but over the next century and a half the paranoia rec edes , as they come to discover the secular tristero . power , om nis cience , im pl ac able malice , attributes of what they 'd thought to be a historical principle , a zeitgeist , are carried over to the now human enemy . so much that , by , it is even suggested that tristero has staged the entire french revolution , just for an excuse to issue the proclamation of g th fri ma ire , an iii , ra ti fying the end of the thurn and taxis postal monopoly in france and the low lands . \" suggested by who , though , \" said oedipa . \" did you read that someplace ? \" would n't somebody have brought it up ? \" bortz said . \" maybe not . \" she did n't press the argument . having begun to feel reluctant about following up anything . she had n't asked genghis cohen , for example , if his expert committee had ever reported back on the stamps he 'd sent them . she knew that if she went back to v es per haven house to talk again to old mr thoth about his grandfather , she would find that he too had died . she knew she ought to write to k . da ching ado , publisher of the un accountable paperback courier 's tragedy , but she did n't , and never asked bortz if he had , either . worst of all , she found herself going often to absurd lengths to avoid talking about randolph driblette . whenever the girl showed up , the one who 'd been at the wa kes , oedipa found excuses to leave the gathering . she felt she was be tra ying driblette and herself . but left it alone , anxious that her revelation not expand beyond a certain point . lest , possibly , it grow larger than she and assume her to itself . when bortz asked her one evening if he could bring in d' am ico , who was at nyu , oedipa told him no , too fast , too nervous . he did n't mention it again and neither , of course , did she . she did go back to the scope , though , one night , restless , alone , le ery of what she might find . she found mike fal lo pian , a couple weeks into raising a beard , wearing button - down olive shirt , c re ased fatigue pants minus cuffs and belt loops , two - button fatigue jacket , no hat . he was surrounded by bro ads , drinking champagne cocktails , and bel lowing low songs . when he spotted oedipa he gave her the wide grin and wa ved her over . \" you look , \" she said , \" wow . like you 're all on the move . training rebels up in the mountains . \" hostile looks from the girls twin ed around what parts of fal lo pian were accessible . \" it 's a revolutionary secret , \" he laughed , throwing up his arms and f lin ging off a couple of camp -

all besides , all financed out of the estate in a way either too secret or too involved for your non - legal mind to know about even though you are co - executor , so lab y rin thine that it must have meaning beyond just a practical joke . or you are f ant as ying some such plot , in which case you are a nut , oedipa , out of your skull . those , now that she was looking at them , she saw to be the alternatives . those symmetrical four . she did n't like any of them , but hoped she was mentally ill ; that 's all it was . that night she sat for hours , too num b even to drink , teaching herself to breathe in a vacuum . for this , oh god , was the void . there was nobody who could help her . nobody in the world . they were all on something , mad , possible enemies , dead . old fil lings in her teeth began to bother her . she would spend nights staring at a ceiling lit by the pink glow of san narciso 's sky . other nights she could sleep for eighteen dru gged hours and wake , ener v ated , hardly able to stand . in conferences with the keen , fast - talking old man who was new counsel for the estate , her attention span could often be measured in seconds , and she laughed ner v ously more than she spoke . waves of na use a , lasting five to ten minutes , would strike her at random , cause her deep misery , then vanish as if they had never been . there were headaches , nightmares , menstrual pains . one day she drove into l . a . , picked a doctor at random from the phone book , went to her , told her she thought she was pregnant . they arranged for tests . oedipa gave her name as grace bortz and did n't show up for her next appointment . genghis cohen , once so shy , now seemed to come up with new goodies every other daya listing in an outdated zum stein catalogue , a friend in the royal phil ate lic society 's dim memory of some muted post horn sp ied in the catalogue of an auction held at dresden in ; one day a ty p es c ri pt , sent him by another friend in new york . it was supposed to be a translation of an article from an issue of the famous biblio the que des tim bro philes of jean - baptiste mo ens . reading like another of bortz 's costume dramas , it told of a great schism in the tristero ranks during the french revolution . according to the recently discovered and de cr y p ted journals of the comte ra oul antoine de v ou zi ers , marquis de tour et t assis , one element among the tristero had never accepted the passing of the holy roman empire , and saw the revolution as a temporary madness . feeling obliged , as fellow aristocrats , to help thurn and taxis weather its troubles , they put out probes to see if the house was interested at all in being subsidized . this move split the tristero wide open . at a convention held in milan , arguments r aged for a week , lifelong en mi ties were created , families divided , blood sp il t . at the end of it a resolution to sub si di ze thurn and taxis failed . many conservatives , taking this as a mill en nial judgement against them , ended their association with the tristero . thus , the article sm ugly concluded , did the organization enter the pen um bra of historical eclipse . from the battle of austerlitz until the difficulties of , the tristero drifted on , deprived of nearly all the noble patronage that had sustained them ; now reduced to handling anarchist correspondence ; only per ip her ally eng ag edin germany with the ill - fated frankfurt assembly , in buda - pe sth at the bar ric ades , perhaps even among the watch makers of the j ura , preparing them for the coming of m . bak un in . by far the greatest number , however , fled to america during - , where they are no doubt at present rendering their services to those who seek to extinguish the flame of revolution . less excited than she might have been even a week ago , oedipa showed the piece to emory bortz . \" all the tristero refugees from the reaction arrive in america , \" it seemed to him , \" full of high hopes . only what do they find ? \" not really asking ; it was part of his game . \" trouble . \" around the u . s . government had carried out a great postal reform , cutting their rates , putting most independent mail routes out of business . by the ' yo 's and ' o 's , any independent carrier that tried to compete with the government was immediately squashed . - was no time for any im mi grating tristero to get ideas about picking up where they 'd left off back in europe . \" so they simply stay on , \" bortz said , \" in the context of conspiracy . other immigrants come to america looking for freedom from tyranny , acceptance by the culture , assimilation into it , this melting pot . civil war comes along , most of them , being liberals , sign up to fight to preserve the union . but clearly not the tristero . all they 've done is to change op positions . by they 're well established , not about to be suppressed . while the pony express is defying deserts , savages and side win ders , tristero 's giving its employees crash courses in si ou an and ath ap as can dialects . disguised as indians their messengers mo sey westward . reach the coast every time , zero attrition rate , not a scratch on them . their entire emphasis now toward silence , impersonation , opposition masquerading as allegiance . \" what about that stamp of cohen 's ? we await silent tristero 's empire . \" they were more open in their youth . later , as the feds cracked down , they went over to stamps that were almost kosher - looking , but not quite . \" oedipa knew them by heart . in the . dark green from the columbian exposition issue ( \" columbus announcing his discovery \" ) , the faces of three c our tiers , receiving the news at the right - hand side of the stamp , had been subtly altered to express un controllable f right . in the . mothers of america issue , put on mother 's day , , the flowers to the lower left of whistler 's mother had been replaced by venus 's - fly trap , bell ad on na , poison sumac and a few others oedipa had never seen . in the postage stamp centenary issue , comm em or ating the great postal reform that had meant the beginning of the end for private carriers , the head of a pony express rider at the lower left was set at a disturbing angle unknown among the living . the deep violet . regular issue of had a faint , menacing smile on the face of the statue of liberty . the brussels exhibition issue of included in its aerial view of the u . s . pavilion at brussels , and set slightly off from the other tiny fair - goers , the unmistakable sil hou ette of a horse and rider . there were also the pony express stamp cohen had showed her on her first visit , the lincoln . with \" u . s . pots age , \" the sinister . air mail she 'd seen on the tat to oed sailor 's letter in san francisco . \" well , it 's interesting , \" she said , \" if the article 's legitimate . \" that ought to be easy enough to check out . \" bortz gazing straight into her eyes . \" why do n't you ? \" the tooth aches got worse , she dreamed of di se mbo died voices from whose malign ance there was no appeal , the soft dusk of mirrors out of which something was about to walk , and empty rooms that waited for her . your gy ne co logist has no test for what she was pregnant with . one day cohen called to tell her that the final arrangements had been made to auction off in ver arity 's stamp collection . the tristero \" forgeries \" were to be sold , as lot . \" and something rather disturbing , miz maas . a new book bi dder has appeared on the scene , whom neither i nor any of the firms in the area have heard of before . that hardly ever happens . \" \" a what ? \" cohen explained how there were floor bi dders , who would attend the auction in person , and book bi dders , who would send in their bids by mail . these bids would be entered in a special book by the auction firm , hence the name . there would be , as was customary , no public disclosure of persons for whom \" the book \" would be bidding . \" then how do you know he 's a stranger ? \" \" word gets around . he 's being super - secretive working through an agent , c . morris s ch ri ft , a very reputable , good man . morris was in touch with the auction eers yesterday to tell them his client wanted to examine our forgeries , lot , in advance . normally there 's no objection if they know who wants to see the lot , and if he 's willing to pay all the postage and insurance , and get everything back inside of hours . but morris got quite mysterious about the whole thing , would n't tell his client 's name or anything else about him . except that as far as morris knew , he was an outsider . so being a conservative house , naturally , they apologized and said no . \" what do you think ? \" said oedipa , already knowing pretty much . \" that our mysterious bi dder may be from tristero , \" cohen said . \" and saw the description of the lot in the auction catalogue . and wants to keep evidence that tristero exists out of unauthorized hands . i wonder what kind of a price they 'll offer . \" oedipa went back to echo courts to drink bourbon until the sun went down and it was as dark as it would ever get . then she went out and drove on the freeway for a while with her lights out , to see what would happen . but angels were watching . shortly after midnight she found herself in a phone booth , in a desolate , unfamiliar , un lit district of san narciso . she put in a station call to the greek way in san francisco , gave the musical voice that answered a description of the ac ned , fuzz - headed in amor ato anonymous she 'd talked to there and waited , inexplicable tears beginning to build up pressure around her eyes . half a minute of c linking glasses , bursts of laughter , sounds of a ju ke box . then he came on . \" this is arnold s nar b , \" she said , choking up . \" i was in the little boys ' room , \" he said . \" the men 's room was full . \" she told him , quickly , using up no more than a minute , what she 'd learned about the tristero , what had happened to hilarius , mucho , metzger , driblette , fal lo pian . \" so you are , \" she said , \" the only one i have . i do n't know your name , do n't want to . but i have to know whether they arranged it with you . to run into me by accident , and tell me your story about the post horn . because it may be a practical joke for you , but it stopped being one for me a few hours ago . i got drunk and went driving on these freeways . next time i may be more deliberate . for the love of god , human life , whatever you respect , please . help me . \" arnold , \" he said . there was a long stretch of bar noise . \" it 's over , \" she said , \" they 've saturated me . from here on i 'll only close them out . you 're free . released . you can tell me . \" it 's too late , \" he said . \" for me ? \" for me . \" before she could ask what he meant , he 'd hung up . she had no more coins . by the time she could get somewhere to break a bill , he 'd be gone . she stood between the public booth and the rented car , in the night , her isolation complete , and tried to face toward the sea . but she 'd lost her bearings . she turned , pi voting on one stacked heel , could find no mountains either . as if there could be no barriers between herself and the rest of the land . san narciso at that moment lost ( the loss pure , instant , spherical , the sound of a stainless orchestral chime held among the stars and struck lightly ) , gave up its residue of uniqueness for her ; became a name again , was assumed back into the american continuity of crust and mantle . pierce in ver arity was really dead . she walked down a stretch of railroad track next the highway . spurs ran off here and there into factory property . pierce may have owned these factories too . but did it matter now if he 'd owned all of san narciso ? san narciso was a name ; an incident among our climatic records of dreams and what dreams became among our accumulated daylight , a moment 's s qu all - line or tornado 's touch down among the higher , more continental sole m ni ties storm - systems of group suffering and need , prevailing winds of af flu ence . there was the true continuity , san narciso had no boundaries . no one knew yet how to draw them . she had dedicated herself , weeks ago , to making sense of what in ver arity had left behind , never suspecting that the legacy was america . might oedipa maas yet be his he ire ss ; had that been in the will , in code , perhaps without pierce really knowing , having been by then too seized by some head long expansion of himself , some visit , some lucid instruction ? though she could never again call back any image of the dead man to dress up , pose , talk to and make answer , neither would she lose a new compassion for the cu l - de - sac he 'd tried to find a way out of , for the enigma his efforts had created . though he had never talked business with her , she had known it to be a fraction of him that could n't come out even , would carry forever beyond any decimal place she might name ; her love , such as it had been , remaining in comm en sur ate with his need to possess , to alter the land , to bring new sky lines , personal an tag on isms , growth rates into being . \" keep it bouncing , \" he 'd told her once , \" that 's all the secret , keep it bouncing . \" he must have known , writing the will , facing the spectre , how the bouncing would stop . he might have written the testament only to harass a one - time mistress , so cy nically sure of being wiped out he could throw away all hope of anything more . bit tern ess could have run that deep in him . she just did n't know . he might himself have discovered the tristero , and encrypted that in the will , buying into just enough to be sure she 'd find it . or he might even have tried to survive death , as a paranoia ; as a pure conspiracy against someone he loved . would that breed of per versity prove at last too keen to be stunned even by death , had a plot finally been devised too elaborate for the dark angel to hold at once , in his humor less vice - president 's head , all the possibilities of ? had something slipped through and in ver arity by that much beaten death ? yet she knew , head down , stumbling along over the cin der bed and its old sle e pers , there was still that other chance . that it was all true . that in ver arity had only died , nothing else . suppose , god , there really was a tristero then and that she had come on it by accident . if san narciso and the estate were really no different from any other town , any other estate , then by that continuity she might have found the tristero anywhere in her republic , through any of a hundred lightly - concealed entrance ways , a hundred alien ations , if only she 'd looked . she stopped a minute between the steel rails , raising her head as if to sniff the air . becoming conscious of the hard , strung presence she stood on knowing as if maps had been fl ashed for her on the sky how these tracks ran on into others , knowing they laced , deep ened , authenticated the great night around her . if only she 'd looked . she remembered now old pullman cars , left where the money 'd run out or the customers vanished , amid green farm flat nesses where clothes hung , smoke la zed out of jo inted pipes . were the squat ters there in touch with others , through tristero ; were they helping carry forward that years of the house 's dis inheritance ? surely they 'd forgotten by now what it was the tristero were to have inherited ; as perhaps oedipa one day might have . what was left to inherit ? that america coded in in ver arity 's testament , whose was that ? she thought of other , im mobilized freight cars , where the kids sat on the floor plan king and sang back , happy as fat , whatever came over the mother 's pocket radio ; of other squat ters who stretched canvas for lean - tos behind smiling bill boards along all the highways , or slept in jun ky ards in the stripped shells of wrecked pl ym ou ths , or even , daring , spent the night up some pole in a lin eman 's tent like cater pillars , swung among a web of telephone wires , living in the very copper rigging and secular miracle of communication , un troubled by the dumb voltages f lic kering their miles , the night long , in the thousands of unheard messages . she remembered dri f ters she had listened to , americans speaking their language carefully , scholarly , as if they were in exile from somewhere else invisible yet congruent with the che ered land she lived in ; and walkers along the roads at night , zo oming in and out of your head lights without looking up , too far from any town to have a real destination . and the voices before and after the dead man 's that had phoned at random during the dark est , slow est hours , searching cease less among the dial 's ten million possibilities for that magical other who would reveal herself out of the roar of re la ys , mon ot one lit ani es of insult , filth , fantasy , love whose brute repetition must someday call into being the trigger for the un na mable act , the recognition , the word . how many shared tristero 's secret , as well as its exile ? what would the probate judge have to say about spreading some kind of a legacy among them all , all those nameless , maybe as a . first installment ? o boy . he 'd be on her ass in a micro second , revoke her letters te st am en tary , they 'd call her names , proclaim her through all orange county as a re di stri bu tionist and pin ko , slip the old man from war pe , wi st full , ku bi ts chek and mc min gus in as administrator de bon is non and so much baby for code , constellations , shadow - leg ate es . who knew ? perhaps she 'd be hounded someday as far as joining tristero itself , if it existed , in its twilight , its alo of ness , its waiting . the waiting above all ; if not for another set of possibilities to replace those that had conditioned the land to accept any san narciso among its most tender flesh without a reflex or a cry , then at least , at the very least , waiting for a symmetry of choices to break down , to go skew . she had heard all about excluded mi dd les ; they were bad shit , to be avoided ; and how had it ever happened here , with the chances once so good for diversity ? for it was now like walking among matrices of a great digital computer , the zeroes and ones twin ned above , hanging like balanced mo bi les right and left , ahead , thick , maybe endless . behind the hier og ly phic streets there would either be a transcendent meaning , or only the earth . in the songs miles , dean , serge and leonard sang was either some fraction of the truth 's nu min ous beauty ( as mucho now believed ) or only a power spectrum . tre maine the swastika sales man 's re pri eve from holocaust was either an injustice , or the absence of a wind ; the bones of the gi 's at the bottom of lake in - ver arity were there either for a reason that mattered to the world , or for skin divers and cigarette smo kers . ones and zeroes . so did the couples arrange themselves . at v es per haven house either an accommodation reached , in some kind of dignity , with the angel of death , or only death and the daily , tedious preparations for it . another mode of meaning behind the obvious , or none . either oedipa in the orbiting ecstasy of a true paranoia , or a real tristero . for there either was some tristero beyond the appearance of the legacy america , or there was just america and if there was just america then it seemed the only way she could continue , and manage to be at all relevant to it , was as an alien , un fur ro wed , assumed full circle into some paranoia . next day , with the courage you find you have when there is nothing more to lose , she got in touch with c . morris s ch ri ft , and in qui red after his mysterious client . \" he decided to attend the auction in person , \" was all s ch ri ft would tell her . \" you might run into him there . \" she might . the auction was duly held , on a sunday afternoon , in perhaps the oldest building in san narciso , dating from before world war ii . oedipa arrived a few minutes early , alone , and in a cold lobby of gle aming redwood floor boards and the smell of wax and paper , she met genghis cohen , who looked genuinely embarrassed . \" please do n't call it a conflict of interests , \" he draw led ear ne stly . \" there were some lovely mozambique tri angles i could n't quite resist . may i ask if you 've come to bid , miz maas . \" no , \" said oedipa , \" i 'm only being a busybody . \" we 're in luck . loren p asser ine , the finest auction eer in the west , will be crying today . \" will be what ? \" we say an auction eer ' cries ' a sale , \" cohen said . \" your fly is open , \" wh is pered oedipa . she was not sure what she 'd do when the bi dder revealed himself . she had only some vague idea about causing a scene violent enough to bring the cops into it and find out that way who the man really was . she stood in a patch of sun , among brilliant rising and falling points of dust , trying to get a little warm , wondering if she 'd go through with it . \" it 's time to start , \" said genghis cohen , offering his arm . the men inside the auction room wore black mo hair and had pale , cruel faces . they watched her come in , trying each to conceal his thoughts . loren p asser ine , on his podium , ho vered like a puppet - master , his eyes bright , his smile practiced and relentless . he stared at her , smiling , as if saying , i 'm surprised you actually came . oedipa sat alone , toward the back of the room , looking at the nap es of necks , trying to guess which one was her target , her enemy , perhaps her proof . an assistant closed the heavy door on the lobby windows and the sun . she heard a lock snap shut ; the sound echoed a moment . p asser ine spread his arms in a gesture that seemed to belong to the priesthood of some remote culture ; perhaps to a descending angel . the auction eer cleared his throat . oedipa settled back , to await the crying of lot\n",

      "from the following ex ch age took place in april and is archived at ' user talk : future perfect at sunrise archive ' ] ; can you link me to the \" fake \" map and or the relevant conversation ? thanks . first of all , macedon ian boy lives in macedonia and i live in germany and i do not get it how can we be as one person . macedon ian boy is a linguist and uses pro oved sources and i am \" just \" economist that makes articles about geography and loves his own mother tongue . regards ras o mk ( talk ) i know they work together ; i 've had dealings with them before . so , what is the source of that map , can somebody please tell me now ? it 's evidently not the one you were discussing as a \" fake \" earlier elsewhere ; it shows entirely different things than either version of that one . that fake issue seems to be a red herring . fut . perf . : okay , so what happened was this . : * was looking for maps of macedonian speakers and came across thing : , from . he asked various people on wiki for advice on if and how he could upload it . : * somebody then found that the original of that image was here : , and that it was significantly different in just the detail he would have been interested in . the version on the macedonian website was apparently manipulated . i have no indication that p mk himself acted in anything but good faith here , by the way , he was just an innocent victim of that forgery . : * some days later macedon ian boy created the [ wiki link : dialects of the macedonian language ] page with the first version of that dialect map . he was a bit slow in identifying the source for his graphics at first . so , laveol , in a knee - jerk reaction , jumped to the conclusion that he must have based it on the fake demographic map . which was nonsense , because that map and the dialect areas map had no similarity whatsoever , they were totally different maps with different topics and different scope . it was plain obvious that macedon ian boy had worked from a different model . that model turned out to be the ( legitimate ) koneski map i also used for my later versions . : that makes sense and i suspected as much since i was familiar with that forgery , but could not trace the development in wikipedia . there are many forgeries - including documents - that have been coming out of yugoslav macedonia and then fy r mak edon ija and they are now ed ging into the wider european mainstream . i consider your linguistic map to be a product of those irregularities ( this is not an accusation , just an interesting though disappointing realisation ) . the map by koneski , i am certain , is a political decision part of the post - wwii irredentist policies in skopje when they re - baptised everything they could ' macedonia n ' . the map was then picked up by a handful of people ( by the way , can you link me to it ? i think i have it , but you never know ) . i also notice with interest that greece lag s way behind in locating , let alone making sense of the nation building forging por cess in r . mak edon ija . this means that , sadly , those ac am dem ics and historians in skopje who have a sound appreciation of their country 's and the region 's history are not heard - because it differs from the all pervasive political hard line . if anyone else reads this posting and agrees or disagrees with it , i am open to discussion . : i for one am surprised that no sources from western european academia ( particularly from those great balkan ethno graphers , the germans ) exist on the distribution slavic macedonian in greek macedonia and that we have to rely on koneski . linguistics is not my field , and i certainly do not mean to offend anyone , but i did a search for him on both web of knowledge and google scholar and found nothing published in international scientific journals besides this \" personal viewpoint \" . : google scholar revealed two books , \" gra ma tika na mak edon ski ot liter atu ren jaz ik \" and \" ist ori ja na mak edon ski ot jaz ik \" , both in slavic macedonian , but nothing in english . are there no scholars that publish in international journals that have studied this question ? where all the german ethno graphers and balkan experts ? i know for a fact that linguists and ethno graphers spend a lot of time studying far more obscure languages and ethnic groups , so i find this a bit surprising . anyway , like i said , i do n't mean to offend anyone or gain say their scholarship , but just to give my perspective as an academic from a different field . : t sour k pk , there are very serious german academic sources on the ethnography of the region of macedonia . the most important of these is the fundamental monograph of prof . [ wiki link : gustav we ig and ] from du is burg , who was a prominent scholar in linguistics at the [ wiki link : university of leipzig ] : * ethno gra phi e von mak edon ien , ges chi cht lich - national er , sp ra ech lich - sta ti sti scher te il von prof . dr . gustav we ig and , leipzig , friedrich brand ste tter , , asin : bh y , l cc n : , lc : dr . m w , oclc : , open library : as all german scientists , prof . we ig and is precise and meticulous throughout . a must read . here is another german book , somewhat more recent , and even more to the point : * [ external link : die sla ven in gri e chen land ] von max vas mer , mit eine kar te , verlag der ak ade mie der wis sen sc ha ften , berlin ( zen tral anti qu ariat der deutschen demo k ra tis chen re pub li k , leipzig ) : thanks t sour k pk that was great . do you have access to the article ? there has been some work on the issue by a handful of greek linguists and historians , on the slav op h ones of greece but in the greek language . there is currently a more detailed linguistic work being written in paris by a pertinent academic from the region . i will continue this discussion if appropriate , on your talk page so as not to burden someone else 's talk page . : of course it would be nice if there was more scholarship about the distribution of minority speakers . the main reason there is n't is probably the hugely difficult surroundings created by the decades - old political paranoia cultivated by the greek society about that topic . ( just imagine you 're a foreign researcher trying to get local cooperation partners and you tell them you are going to find out about macedonian slavic speakers in greece . ) but anyway , why are we racking our brains over this ? we use the scholarship that exists . : and , i repeat , the actual number and quantitative distribution of speakers is pretty irrelevant for the present map , a fact that you both still do n't seem to appreciate . difficult as this may be for you to comprehend , but the map is really , really intended to be exclusively about where those stupid is og losses run . slavic speakers in fl or ina speak more or less like those in bitola , while those in ka storia speak slightly differently , and those in ede ssa speak like those in ver ia . that 's what it says , not more and not less . whether there are or of them plays no role . and whether they identify as greeks or macedonians or bulgarians or whatever plays no role either . : on this purely linguistic level , i do n't see any reason to doubt what koneski and friedman tell us . how these speakers related to nationalities or national languages or whatever is totally irrelevant . i think you flatter greek scholarship . sure political insecurity has something to do with it , but also the astonishing greek lack of sh ol arly curiosity about the region , including the varieties of greek culture and experiences . have you seen anything recent on cor fi ot or chian or south albanian greek ? or even on the hel len o - vlach and sar akat sani greek of fy r mak edon ija and bulgaria ? the , presumably , greek contributions we get here are from private researchers who are giving their cents worth in a manner that reminds me of our great - grand fathers ' solitary pur su ite of regional history ( obviously , i say this with affection ) . : my bad , i thought we were talking about the minority languages map in the [ wiki link : greece ] article . never mind . but on a purely academic level , you do n't see a reason to doubt an academic that has exactly publications in the international literature ? it 's a question of credentials . or is this a case of \" he might be crappy , but he 's the only one we got \" ? on a side note , i 've been hearing plenty of se or gru evski 's statements of late to understand where this \" greek political paranoia \" comes from ( not to mention all that united macedonia crap all over their diaspora ) . links that wow . ' folk songs in kil kis , macedonia , greece ' ; ' slav ophone greeks speak about themselves ' : i interfere in this discussion because the topic is of interest to me . i notice that both sides strive for objectivity , and therefore they gain my respect . the problem is that particularly in the macedonian case , one can not easily separate linguistic from political aspect . the position of future perfect that the question is only about where some is og loss runs is a position that must be adhered to in any general ling us tic mapping . in this case , however , one must be careful about historical and political issues . thus , the map does n't specify the period for which it is applied , nor whether it takes into account spoken , or written language , the extent of use of the language , and many such details . it may turn out , for instance , than years ago in drama there were people speaking the macedonian dialect of bulgarian language but today they either left the region or use exclusively greek language . in such case , stating that today this language is spoken in drama , is misleading . to this one must add the propensity of fyrom scholars to push the border marking into the neighbour 's territory as far as possible . because there is a scholarly literature with such ( or similar ) map , it must not be hidden from the public but it has to be specified that it is the view of scholars from fyrom , in the absence of greek sources , so that it must be taken with a pinch of salt . : just for the sake of accuracy , i am under the impression that the author of the original map is not bla e koneski , but bo id ar vi does ki . the map ( if i am not mistaken ) was first published in bla e koneski , a historical phonology of the macedonian language with a survey of the macedonian dialects and a map by bo zi dar vi does ki , tr . victor friedman , ( historical phonology of the slavic languages , ) heidelberg carl winter , . this publication was a revised edition and translation of ist ori ja na mak edon ski ot jaz ik ( ) , which included neither the map , nor the dialect survey . unfortunately , i have not managed to trace the book here in athens , but it would be nice if somebody could find it ( future perfect ? ) and provide any additional information ( particularly on the time span of the map and the sources used for its drafting ) . as for bla e koneski , i should add that his work in co dif ying the macedonian literary language in is considered a major turning point . lun t , friedman , christina cramer considered him a mentor and have relied heavily on his work . it goes without saying that he is seen as a controversial figure in greece and bulgaria : k . koneski , not b . ; ) i think the k is for ki ril , but not sure . ' : but yes , vi does ki apparently has a map in polski - macedon ski gram at y ka kon fron ta ti w na with z . to po li ska . i think all the info is in the [ external link : image description ] ' : are you sure about ki ril ( sic ) koneski ? i think that this whole discussion was about this koneski [ wiki link : bla e koneski here ] . the map is indeed based on vi does ki , but it was attributed to koneski in this discussion so i thought that it would be better to clarify things a bit . i think though that the map first appeared in the publication i cited and not in the one mentioned in the image description . be that as it may , some more background on this whole map issue would be welcome . i for one would be quite interested to learn more about it . unfortunately , there 's not much here in athens and friedman 's book on your language is extremely concise in certain aspects : well , your assumption is not unreasonable , since the more famous koneski is bla e , but fp can clarify who he meant . what exactly would you like to know more about in regards to the map by the way ? ' well well . look what i 've found . more fucking conspiring between bf and f upe . when will this end ? you guys have threatened the integrity of the encyclopedia for too long , and i for one will not stand for this , at all ! : hmmm , somebody is yan king their chains to earn themselves yet another very clever dog award , it seems . you know what a temptation it is to see the word \" block \" , in nice blue , right next to you guys ' user names in every line where they are listed in a page history ? it says to me : balkan fever - block ! be ama than - block ! gi or gos tz im as - block ! makes my mouse finger t wi tch each time i read it . : it was all him dammit ! i 'm innocent ! ' : am i missing something ? : no , balkan fever and f upe have been conspiring against you and me for several years now . seeing as i 've found the balls to proclaim these factual fac tful facts , they will do anything to silence me . he even threatened my clever dog . be weary from now on gi or gos . be weary . : i knew it all along . but now on a more serious note : yes , it would be very interesting to find the vi does ki publication i mentioned earlier . it must be very informative judging from its title : there actually seems to be a recent english translation , of what is very likely essentially the same work : . thanks for pointing out the difference between koneski and vi does ki . with all those - skis , i must have been mixing them up all the time . by the way , do n't mind beam , he 's just raving mad . : lol . it 's been in my order list since last week and i just realized what i ordered . : now all we need to do is find out which koneski you were confusing with vi does ki . ; ) bla e or ki ril ? ' : i found another map in a macedonian ( fyrom ) web site . it shows where \" macedonian \" language is spoken , and looks quite different from the map discussed here . in the legend it writes : \" a map of macedonia published in the harvard encyclopedia of american ethnic groups indicating the areas where the macedonian language is spoken \" . the site is openly nationalistic , it starts with \" macedonia for the macedonians \" , etc . but it would be interesting to look in this harvard encyclopedia if one can find it . : that map is patently un useable for our purposes . it could serve for the map in [ wiki link : minorities in greece ] , perhaps ( where we have an even more restricted area currently shown ) . it has a totally different scope from the dialect map . it obviously intends only to give a very rough overview of where most of the macedonian speakers come from . it does n't tell us anything about dialects . so , l aga din , ver ia and ne stra m are n't included in it ? too bad . and yet , the dial ec to logical literature does describe slavic dialects of those places . friedman not only claims that there are ( or were ) speakers there , he actually describes how they speak . maybe there are only a dozen of them left , who knows ? a demographic map wo n't show them . a dialect map has to . : well , it says \" where macedonian language is spoken \" , not \" where most macedonian speakers come from \" . that 's why it would be interesting to find the original to see what is it about . it might have some data about number of speakers , time spans , etc . too old though , . : i found it with google search but unfortunately not the page with the map . on macedonia , only p . with some interesting materials there like : there is no way to determine the exact number of macedonian americans . . however , this figure ( - , ) includes all slavic speaking immigrants and their descendants from the historical region [ macedonia ] and does not allow for the fact that the majority of immigrants from macedonia and their descendants identify with the bulgarian - american community while many from greece identify with the greek - american community . ' : i vaguely remember to have seen an academic book with maps of bulgarian dialects . almost certainly it covers most of the territory of the \" macedonian \" language and gives details about each dialect . i will go to the library to search it and will put the info . probably your user page is not the right place for this discussion so i can move all of this to another page of your choice\n",

      "in greece freedom of religion for all greeks is guaranteed in the constitution , but really greece is a religious intolerance state ! as announces officially ' the committee for the hellenic religion of do de ca the on : to whom it may con cer nath ens , greece , december , still standing fe br . in gre ce the human right of religious freedom is non - exist ed bearing in mind the seriousness of the following accusations , we categorically and re gre tably denounce greece as a country in which human rights are not well protected , at least freedom of religion is not for all of its citizens equally . there a number of human rights , that we enjoy in greece of course , such as the freedom of political affiliation . it is another matter entirely when we wish to express freely our basic convictions in addressing fundamental rights questions , such as the one about man or cosmos , however ! man as a thinking being pon ders on these questions . proof of this is those who have worked on the human rights issues from a philosophical point of view ; the authors of human rights charters , as well the governments that have af fixed their signatures of approval of these charters , all unanimously decreed , that the first human right which is the root of all other rights , is the one concerning religious freedom . this really constitutes the individual 's primary defence against the state 's authority and its abuse , and has been characterized by leg alists as \" the root of individual freedom \" . the right to religious freedom is , unfortunately , not equally afforded to all citizens of greece , since one must be either orthodox christian or else not exist at all . thus in reality , despite the attitudes and policies towards other rights , it is of little or no value at all for us , because of the prevailing attitude towards religion . the above are not our own views , alone . it is a known fact that the european human rights court is continuously handing down convictions of greece , concerning freedom of religion matters . * the greek state by its laws divides its citizens into two categories as far as religion is concerned . to those who believe in the three \" byzantine \" religions ( judaism , eastern orthodoxy and islam ) , who are afforded the right of religious freedom ; and those of other faiths , denominations or creeds to whom this right ( right of religious freedom ) is denied . this latter group is afforded the right to \" holy worship \" only , which is a even much less important concept , than freed on of religion afforded the first group . however , the greek government does not even enforce existing laws and illegally and arbitrarily and against the law and the constitution , and ignoring its own signature of approval on all human rights international agreements , totally de pri ves certain greek citizens the right of religious freedom , totally . it goes as far as to disallow even the right to \" holy worship \" , as well in certain cases ! specifically : ) the greek government follows a policy of religious oppression . the result of which is that the eastern orthodox church has essentially become a ' state - enforced religion ' ; and the other faiths or denominations are barely , if at all , tolerated . the following certainly point in that direction : the obligatory , brainwashing quality cate ch esis in schools and the brainwashing of members of the armed forces , the illegal association of public schools with cate che tical schools of the eastern orthodox church . the special and favorable treatment of members of the armed forces who follow the ' predominant ' faith of orthodoxy . even the ability of the military to perform their duties and the loyalty of public employees is some how dependent or related to their association with the christian orthodox creed ! the illegal maintaining of extensive files with records of the religious preferences and beliefs of the citizens who serve as public employees , of students in schools and generally , of the totality of citizens , by the security related agencies of the state . there is an infinite number of laws in favor of the eastern orthodox church , including being ex emp ted from taxation and being government supported ; the clergy , for example , the priests are paid by the government as they are considered employees of the state . naturally with funds obtained from our taxation in order to support a religion , that we do not espouse ! there is the constant , indispensable and authoritative presence of the eastern orthodox church officials , ie priests , bishops etc , in every public or state activity ie the non - religious celebration of national holidays , the religious oath of members of parliament and of the ministers of the government etc . this certainly re - enforces the idea of a ' state religion ' . generally and for some strange reason the state attributes compliance with the law to having connection with the eastern orthodox church . it also makes it amply clear to every citizen that if one is not a christian orthodox , he is not in compliance with the law and could be therefore subject to consequences ! an example of this is a letter sent by an eastern orthodox church bishop to greek citizens who had left orthodoxy and had espoused another denomination , whom he threatened with deportation , all this in , no less ! a former minister of justice of the present greek government admits : the church wishes a state that guides its citizens towards a ' state church ' in essence . as a consequence , the state is in violation of fundamental human rights . today 's influence of the church is not due to its own strength based on its teachings , spiritual work etc . alone , but also on the influence which the church derives from its ' state status ' . as such , the strength of the church is not dependent on its own merits alone , but on borrowed strength from the state . the church 's influence acquires therefore an exo genous , artificial and unreal dimension to a great extent . [ michael sta th op oulos , the constitutional guarantee of religious freedom , published in law matters regarding religious variants in greece , athens , p . ] in addition , the greek government does not react to the various illegal and ter r ori zing acts of the eastern orthodox church against other religions . regarding us , especially , the greek state leaves us without lawful protection , as such we are subject to all kinds of pressure and without pretence , it grants the eastern orthodox church of greece , the right to exert pressure for our extinction ; to hur l insults against us in cess antly ( officially , by its bishops giving sermons from the pulpit ) ; to have established offices in every bishopric in order to monitor and record our activities , this of course against all civil liberties laws [ the greek church holy synod , officially admitted the latter , as it announced it on nov , ] . we have officially denounced this fact to the official and independent ' personal data protection authority ' on june , , but without any action taken , to date , to protect us , however . lastly , the church attempts to hinder our religious activities with any method possible , thus violating systematically articles no . and of the penal code ; and pro pag ates enmity among us and our fellow citizens ! our activities are concurrently monitored by the police and other state security agencies . regarding this , we made our protests known to the ministry of public order and the ministry of internal affairs as the superior agency of the national intelligence service ; thus far we have had no response . ) specifically about the right to religious freedom in greece . the right to religious freedom has two aspects : the social right and that of the individual . a ) the social right to religious freedom does not exist . that is a certain religion or creed does not have the self - evident right to exist as a legal entity within the state 's legal order of things . as far as the greek state is concerned religions are non - existent and un substantial , with the exception of the three \" byzantine \" religions ( judaism , eastern orthodoxy and islam ) . the state has granted those religions , special rights and privileges , such as the right to be a legal person of public law , through specific laws . the european courts have ruled , however , that such special treatment of certain religions has to be ' sufficiently justified ' . the greek state has never provided such justification , thus far . regarding the american state department 's report on religious freedom in greece and greece 's response , the following remarks have to be noted : . greece asserts that all religions are & ' equivalent ' . however , apart from the aforementioned issues , no law exists that would allow a religion to be officially recognized and to acquire legal entity status . the religions that have acquired legal entity status , as the above mentioned three religions , have done so through special laws enacted specifically for them . consequently , there is surely no e qu i val ency between all religions , since some have legal entity status being legal person of public law and others can not acquire it . greece asserts that the observation that minority religions are not allowed to own property is false , since all physical and legal entities in greece have this right to do so . this is not so , however , since a religion , obviously , not a physical entity and since it does not have the ability to acquire legal entity status , therefore , can not own property . an example of that is the recent troubles of the roman catholic church having been ad judged legally non - existent at all levels of the judicial system ! b ) as far as the right of the individual to religious freedom is concerned . the right of the individual to religious freedom has many aspects and only members of the three aforementioned religions enjoy all of them fully . as far as the other religions or denominations are concerned , the greek state arbitrarily and by special legislation , grants to certain of them some but not all aspects of the many that are part of the right of religious freedom of the individual . for example , the greek state recognizes and arbitrarily directs the official recording in the national bureau of public records of weddings , bap tis ms , fun er als and naming ceremonies of certain religions or denominations , only . in order to remedy this injustice against us we submitted two petitions in , requesting to be recognized as a religion known and acceptable . we had attached a list of . signatures requesting this . we had wished to be included in the registry of the ' known ' religions in order to enable us to record sacraments and ceremonies conducted by our religion in the registry of public records , as mentioned above , just as the other recognized religions do . our petitions were not answered properly . additional aspects of the individual 's right of religious freedom that we do not enjoy and especially protest against are ( a ) the right to dispose the bodies of our dead by c re mation which is the traditional greek way of dis posing the body , since hom eric age , and ( b ) the right to enter and have a holy service in our holy places . the greek sacred sites of antiquity are today the property of ministry of culture as archaeological sites . we have submitted a lot of petitions requesting to be allowed to enter in one or two sacred sites just once a year for a half an hour 's holy service but the ministry of culture did not answer our petitions completely , as such disregarding the right , that we are guaranteed , not only by the constitution but also by the un declaration concerning the rights of indigenous people to their sacred places , as well . for all the other religions or denominations that are not favored by special legislature , the law of the greek state recognizes the individual right of freedom of worship , only . we can not understand the state 's justification for granting certain religions rights and pri vi le dges denied to others . the greek go ver mn ment categorizes religions without proper justification ! c ) as far as the individual right of freedom of worship is concerned . it is , the only part of the total number of rights which constitute the human right to religious freedom that the greek state permits to be exercised by ad her rents of 'd category ' religions and consists of establishing a place of worship ( this has a weaker legal status , than a church or temple . according to law only the eastern orthodox church has the right to have churches or temples ) . this right is based on two necessity acts passed in - , a turbulent period of dictatorship , and another law passed in , during the german occupation of greece . the purpose of these laws was to hinder the granting of even the minimal of human rights . these laws are unconstitutional from many aspects , and certain of their provisions insult the citizens ' dignity since they humiliate them by permitting the orthodox church to interfere with their right of freedom of worship . d ) our petition for permission for a place of worship . despite of all the above , we did apply for permission to establish a place of worship according to the aforementioned laws , on june , . the petition was accompanied by a list of significant number of signatures . after the petition was received by the proper department of the ministry of education and religious affairs , civil employees there informed us that our file was complete , ie we had supplied all the documents necessary and it was a first , for a file to be so complete and to be accompanied by many more signatures than were required by law . they also related to us that since , there were so many convictions of greece by the european human rights court , exactly , for stalling to issue permissions for a place of worship , this time such a permission would have been promptly issued . despite of such assurances , our petition has not been approved , even three years have passed ! the former minister of education and religious affairs , mr . pe tro s eu th imi ou , has not responded to our requests for a hearing with him ! from our several contacts with the civil employees in the appropriate department we have been left with the impression that our petition may never be answered , most likely ! the official and independent authority ' citizen 's advocate ' ( ob dur sman ) that we appealed to , has informed , rather in vain , the ministry of education and religious affairs that the minister can not exercise , in this case , ' discretion ' , and that he has the obligation to reply to our petition within a reasonable length of time and to give a final reply or to explain the reasons for the delay , for not doing so at all . just the same was the opinion of the official and independent authority human rights national committee . we have by now applied for permission to establish three other places of worship outside the capital . but thw silence still persists and the new greek government has a clearly hostile attitude towards us ! the greek state tells us that even these humiliating long outdated laws , actually referred as ' fossils ' and characterized as such in a scientific article written by the general secretary of the department of religions of the ministry , do not pertain to us , and that they exist only , to be presented to the un in spec tors , upon request ! in our case , the ministry of education and religious affairs violates the constitution and laws of the greek state . it strengthens the obstacles set in our way by the aforementioned laws and rec k ons that these laws are indeed very liberal and it would probably be a good idea , if we were to return to the justinian code which as mentioned above demanded that every citizen either be christian orthodox or not exist at all ! we have informed the european ob dur sman about our sorry condition . he has told us that for our rights we have to put a petition to the greek parliament that is responsible for the human rights ing re ece . we did so a lot of times . but the parliament never answered our petition ! the ministry of education and religious affairs con ce als the truth , in this case , from international organizations . according to the official position of the authorized director of the ministry , who stated during the conference for the religious freedom on march , , that now , there is a speedy approval of all requests for places of worship and that there is none pending for approval ! similar assurances and explanations were also given to the european council . * thus , having exhausted all of our requests , petitions , appeals and pleas with the greek authorities and organizations ; we now turn to the public and international organizations and call on them to morally stigma tize and condemn the hostile attitude of the greek government towards human religious rights . in the hope that international pressure will come to bear and force the greek government to respect , at last , the greek constitution and its signature af fixed on international human rights agreements\n",

      "this project wants to create and fill complete world history maps atlas where user can see map of world in any date and detail such maps should be usable in wikipedia articles ( in later versions ) should user see animation of borders ( f . e . during any war ) day by day : in reply to the above comments : for the last several years , i have been wishing to download a blank world map , write a python ( or other language ) script that can take many different parameters ( region , date - range , optional layers of information ( stone age tool distribution , langauge distribution , river bas ins water sheds , cultural national sovereignty , etc ) to overlay ) , lookup the data for those parameters in a t edi ously hand - written database of coordinates , color assignments , and other values ) , then output however many bmp , gif , ps , or svg frames are necessary to show whatever evolution of \" stuff \" one wants to see . i could waste my time detailing the many false starts i 've gone through trying to get off the ground , but i think the only useful work i 've accomplished has been the lat lon boundaries of the continental regions of interest in a crude [ wiki link : generic mapping tools gmt ] script . i feel as if i were simultaneously cursed with an abundance of ideas and poor planning skills . : i have used gmt as well for the map in the article [ wiki link : lucius pau ll us ] . i propose that we use the resources that best fit the amount of participants joining us and the skills they have . at the moment we are only with three or four , so we should use something easy like gmt , which does n't cost too much time . : i must have a look at gmt first , than i will reply you , if there is someone could give me link to short overview how to create very simple map there i will be glad thanks ( for me very interesting if it could create any file with coordinates inside and or if it can read such file ) : surely i think about database of coordinates too , ) you click on [ external link : this link ] and click the form , which is written in pink . under map boundaries you can put down coordinates . under north into , under west you change - into , under south you change - into and under east you can change - into . then you scroll down untill you see the create map button . after you did this , you will be able to see the most beautiful country on earth . if you are not sat tis fied with the results , then you can change the coordinates to get another map . : this way you will get ' standard output ' , i expect the next will be your hand work in any graphics editor , or did you ever enter ' user defined locations ' with ' connect locations ' at that page ? having own database of coordinates it should be easy create text you will just paste there and it will create you own map with your polygon , one problem here it is just one polygon ( comparing with google earth - there in k ml file you can have more polygons , also you can create new polygons there just by mouse clicks - see next ) ; result : searching of existing ( gmt based ? ) tool will allow more : or could we use google - earth like our polygon - creation editor ? > da ans chr < , could you express your opinion to create lines in ge ? is it comfortable enough ? generaly i can accept you will create more shorter border parts ( means f . e . a - b - c and c - d not one very long a - b - c - d only ) or maybe just points ( pl ac emer ks ) there ( our system will connect them f . e . using ' get next nearest point ' logic ) ; can you please make any real simple try ? f . e . try to create polygon will follow any existing border part : i do n't know what ge is . does [ wiki link : polygon ] mean drawing lines ? i have used [ wiki link : inkscape ] , but was not very sat tis fied with the results . : ge is google earth [ externa link : http : earth . google . com ] program you must download and install , yes , polygon means drawing lines there ( menu add polygon ) , such polygon you will name and can save as ( k ml ) file ( right click at polygon name ( in ' places ' window ) and save - as ) , later you can such file ( it has real coordinates inside ) read back ( file open ) , double click to name will turn globe so you will see it in detail , you can hide it ( un check ) or delete ( context menu ) , if someone wants change coordinates manu aly it could be done by editing k ml file in note pad : ( to make it sure : we do not plan use ge to get final pictures because of lin c ese - just can think about it to create coordinates graphical way - mouse clicks ) : why you was not satisfied with inkscape results ? : as we already know we will not take final pictures from google earth because of license , so how we will create our pictures ? : we can use gmt maps from [ external link : aqu arius ] perhaps , but they are pixel based instead of vector based . : . is it enough our system will create just simple ( black and white ) picture with required border lines there ? ( imagine picture of europe you can see at this page just in two colors ) also can think about filling of areas by one color but maybe ( for begin ) it should be done than by hand in graphics editor ; > da ans chr < , could you comment this idea ? : i used [ wiki link : gimp ] for filling the map with colour , but gimp has been wr acked . everytime i un install and rein stall this program it uses the old settings . i guess i can only use the way i did before by first formatting the hard drive on my computer and then rein stall windows . : not functional gimp is not main problem now , you can use any other program ( easy things like fill areas by color also by m spa int included in windows ) , question is how simple picture output from our system is usable : . draw using gmt ; i still did not investigate gmt tools intern aly ( not www page you game me link to ) , still possible can use intern aly them to display our maps ( create not just b & w ; pictures with lines but something more detained ( f . e . just rivers and mountains , but not actual state borders ) , can you , > x ax af rad < , comment this idea a bit ? ( one day can have a look at [ externa link : http : www . uc al gary . ca phillips graphics gmt . html ] if it is possible change example scripts a bit to get them without state borders ( expect just modify something in p sco ast line ) and check what is necessary to transform example scripts to pictures , the best if there is any web - based service for it ) : . maybe if gmt draw is not usable for us ; for next versions we can investigate how it is with [ externa link : http : ear tho b serv atory . nasa . gov newsroom blu em ar ble ] usage and license , the best cancel this research for initial version , maybe can just have a look at nasa - www output with it - from first look i understand in details it already uses something else is not free , right ? than can we use nasa - www without satellite pictures for output ? is it good enough ? should be way to store disputed territories ( f . e . today 's example is borders between china and india ) should be way to create modification of maps for wikipedia discussions : in my imagination , this theoretical database is built on a foundation of pre - defined geographic areas , small enough to be workable , probably something like - regions ( that might just be for land ) . i have n't looked very far into the divisions of [ wiki link : list of eco regions eco regions ] , but i think it 's a good framework for inspiration . if ownership of a region is disputed , simply mark it as such , and be sure to include database space to identify multiple claim ant ship . : it would be hard to fit all ancient states and regions into - regions . an idea of ti bor on the talk page , was to have a system similar to [ wiki link : google maps ] . my idea about it is that we can have several scales of maps . one would be a worldwide scale , in which the german empire of would be represented as one block without the small states visible . we could scale the maps to a local level where even the districts of small countries can become visible . : to be more correct : . ' system similar to google maps ' - i can easily imagine system will display such picture of europe like is here - see down - it means will draw borders ( lines ) will not draw satellite images ( like google maps has because pays for them ) . i can imagine that man who wants create new map will use f . e ' google earth ' like editor to draw such borders - my question to such man is if he can find this comfortable ; i 'm able export any in our system already stored border there - what can be also used like helping background : if i understand idea of smallest possible regions well ( ? ) i can just agree with da ans comment - hard to imagine there is usable list of such regions you can just combine to any map in the history : idea of map levels scales is for next discussion , generaly there should be any belongs - to relation ( bayern - germany - european union - europe - nato - etc . ) but sometimes one element could belong to more one - level - up elements ( to kaj wine area is part of slovakia and hu gar ia and does not fit to any actual political border ) and many times you can define more independent level systems ( nato , european union ) : and already generaly speaking about belongs - to relation : maybe it will be ' belongs - to with date - range ' or opposite ' contains - what ' because some regions could belong to different countries in different time : in this moment i again repeat my idea of border parts sharing ( having border parts of greece you already have done part of borders of europe , nato , european union ) , just ( see to kaj example up ) probably will be not possible just combine small political border parts to get any required element ( one more argument against list of basic regions ) - of course question is how freely generaly will be our database defined ( is something like to kaj area ( or wh e et - planting area in china or forest - area in brazil etc . ) case for us ? one day probably yes , question is when deal with it really ) : i will rearrange the talk page and the project page , because we have two talk pages at the moment . : determining borders will also pose a huge problem . historical atl ases contradict eachother often in details . there has been regions where the population did n't even know where they belonged to , so we ca n't know it for them . a contemporary example is present - day somalia , which is in anarchy nowadays . for a long while , only the cities were really part of an empire , the countryside did n't really belong to a certain country , especially in remote areas . ireland for instance was organized in col lec tives of people untill the th century and not into land areas as is normal in the ( modern ) western world . another problem is sovereignty . in the middle ages , the pope and the emperor fought on who was the representative of god on earth , other rulers were supposed to obey to either the pope or the emperor including the kings of england france . small regions kept on resisting any attempt of a powerful state the rule the area . it would be good to first take over all the crude border lines as represented in historical atl ases and to have some organize the study of the details of border lines , which will never be sufficient enough and will always be controversial . plan is more sof is tic ated system than just bit map sit has intern aly store not just any general graphical objects ( picture points or border lines ) but something more intelligent like ' border , between france and germany , valid from . till . , part - , list - of - coordinates ' and will draw all necessary parts on request like ' borders , germany , . jan . ' , zoom - to - see - all - requested - borders , fill by green colour ' ( expect background will be fixed ( continents boundaries will be in vector form too ? ) question is user interface for historians to fill such dat ab ase what also depends on development ef for tif historians team will be patient enough it should start with something like nearly manual writing of co or din ates or ' leg aly thi ef ing ' them from another system ( continents have to be offered from begin , right ? ) anyway do n't expect first version will have big user comfort for them - expect initial problem will be define minimal usable one maybe later - with first experiences and visible results - can get more people to project and make it more user - friend ly or maybe we will reuse any existing system - if possible ( nasa w - w ? ) maybe output will be just export of concrete static pictures from there to put them into web pages still no deep analyse , decision or even real search and examination of existing sol u tions anyway : keeping historians work into coordinate - based database will later enable tran form it to new ( more sophisticated ) system ( fully or nearly ) au tom a tic aly with just bitmap pictures you have n't such pos si bi li ty searching i found many other links like [ externa link : http : meta . wikimedia . org wiki user : robert harrison reformat of proposals for new projects and related pages ] [ externa link : http : meta . wikimedia . org wiki proposals for new projects wikipedia : map ] [ externa link : http : meta . wikimedia . org wiki new project proposals group geography ] and maybe have a look at [ externa link : http : meta . wikimedia . org wikipedia historical atlas ] [ externa link : http : mail . wikimedia . org pipermail foundation - l - july . html ] retrieved from \" http : en . wikipedia . org wikipedia : wikiproject historical atlas\n",

i was just a bit sick of looking at domer telling me off for \" edit - warring \" . : as for the flag , i completely agree . the ulster banner is undoubtedly the de facto flag of ni , hence uefa , the commonwealth games , the p ga tour , etc . , all using it . but this is wikipedia , so , of course , it 's not that simple . we ca n't even call people \" northern irish \" ( i . e . from northern ireland ) , for heaven 's sake , for fear of \" labelling them \" . : welcome to the pov propaganda warfare part of wikipedia lol : haha . you 're telling me . what do you think to what 's going on at [ wiki link : cor por als killings ] ? : i see no reason as to why the two press sources ca n't be exp lic lty stated , and a they are wikilinked too , the reader is all too able to find out what the independant is . its a very poor arguement against it . be careful though , you can be acc us sed of [ wiki link : wp : canvass canvassing ] . : i did n't know about that particular guideline , thanks for the heads up . as much as i 'd like to assume good faith , the sentence is clearly being presented in a way that makes it look like the news sources are partisan and that the men were n't tortured , owing to the fact that they 're british sources . : sorry if i confused you into replying to the discussion on the talk page , by the way ! : yeah i got confused into the wrong debate lol . your comment is what i was going to try to say in my last comment , but could n't figure out why it seemed wrong for me to word it . i think your assumption is correct . there is no policy against stating the two sources the way you did . : oops , sorry . oh well , maybe you 'll spark the other one back to life ! it has n't been reverted again yet , so it might stick ( until tomorrow at least ) ) i think that the [ wiki link : flag of northern ireland ] , the so - called ' [ wiki link : ulster banner ] ' , is not a terribly suitable flag for [ wiki link : northern ireland ] . after all , it was the flag of the ( for the [ wiki link : nationalists ( ireland ) nationalist ] community ) oppressive and sectarian [ wiki link : government of northern ireland ] , an administration that seemed to serve the [ wiki link : ulster uni onism ulster unionist ] people only . the flag itself was only actually in official use for a very short time , i believe , from around up until . the old [ wiki link : coat of arms of northern ireland ] , on which the ' ulster banner ' was based , was somewhat older , having been designed in the very early s by the former office of arms in [ wiki link : dublin castle ] and adopted in . both of these emblems , along with the [ wiki link : great britain british ] [ wiki link : union jack ] , are offensive to the nationalist community in [ wiki link : northern ireland the north ] . i would , however , have no problem with a new , inclusive official flag being designed for the north , a flag that would ' celebrate ' ( if that is the correct term ) the region being part of both [ wiki link : ulster ] and [ wiki link : ireland ] as well as ' celebrating ' the region 's links to [ wiki link : great britain ] . such a flag could be jointly designed by both the [ wiki link : college of arms ] in [ wiki link : london ] and the [ wiki link : genealogical office ] in [ wiki link : dublin ] , taking advice from a committee appointed by the [ wiki link : northern ireland assembly ] . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : with respect , ip , whilst i do applaud your recognising that northern ireland needs a national flag of its own , if elements of the nationalist republican community do find the union flag ( of the [ wiki link : united kingdom ] , not [ wiki link : great britain ] , as you incorrectly stated ) offensive , they are more than welcome to emi grate . similarly , why on earth would the genealogical office in dublin , the capital city of a foreign state , be asked to co - design the new flag ? i 'm all for that , as long as , at the same time , we ask the south to redesign their rebel flag with british input . sound fair ? : i think you should visit [ wiki link : ireland ] ( north and south ) sometime . by your rather ' un hinged ' rant above , i doubt that you have ever visited my home country of [ wiki link : ireland ] or my home province , the nine - county province of [ wiki link : ulster ] ! in particular , i think that you should spend some time amongst my community , the [ wiki link : irish catholic ] community , over here . you just do n't seem to understand ( or want to understand ) the views and aspirations of the irish catholic community in ireland , north and south , a community that makes up the vast majority of the population over here . that is certainly the impression i get from your quite [ wiki link : right - wing politics right - wing ] , and very ' [ wiki link : united kingdom independence party ukip ] - esque ' , rant above . and , by the by , we irish catholics in the [ wiki link : six counties ] do not see the [ wiki link : republic of ireland ] as a ' foreign state ' . we ca n't help it , mate ! we just do n't . you probably do n't understand that either . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : if you think the above is an un hinged rant , you 're welcome to stop posting on my talk page , mystery ip man . i understand fully your views and aspirations ; but it does n't mean i have to agree with them . what of the views and aspirations of the other community that inhabit your fair isle ? ( which i have visited , by the way both south and north . ) are the unionists not irish men too ? why is their desire to remain part of the united kingdom any less valid than your desire not to ? whether you like it or not , irish catholics n ats republicans are n't the only irish men , and can not profess to speak for the whole island nor shape its destiny single - handedly . ireland was parti tioned so the unionists could continue to live in the uk and the nationalists in an independent state of their own . the alternative is undemocratic dominance by one group over the other . : unionists do n't move to the south then complain about the fact they 're living in an independent irish state ; why would nationalists expect non - british governance if they 're living in a part of the uk ( the north ) ? s i 'm curious . i have a feeling that some , if not most all , of the scots names have been made - up by the authors of the sources cited . this current ul st r - scotch mal ar key seems to have started in the s . if references for those names can be found before the s it would indicate that scots - speakers might have actually used them , either in speech or writing . my friend google ca n't find any references other than those provided in the articles . : i 'm sure they may have been , because the ulster - scots language has traditionally been something passed down from word - of - mouth and , as it says in the article , the literary tradition was for a time almost extinct . it also mentions in the [ wiki link : ulster scots dialects ] article that since the s there have been attempts to create new or tho graphies . whether any of us like it or not , though , ul l ans is given a parity of esteem with irish under the g fa , so we 've got to try and reflect that on here . we ca n't just leave out scots names because we do n't agree with we do n't think they 're \" authentic \" enough . : surely wikipedi s has to reflect real facts , not made - up placenames that came about as a result of the g fa ? since when has wikipedia been subject to the g fa ? even if the language was passed down by word of mouth it would not be unusual for someone somewhere , at some time , to have noted what scots - speakers called places . the sources you provide are extremely dubious , and that should be pointed out in the article . : how are ni uk government sources \" dubious \" ? the only sources that could be more reliable would be sources from an ulster - scots academy , but they 're not built that yet . : and which article ? your grievances are already addressed at [ wiki link : ulster scots dialects ] ( a little too much so , in my opinion ) . : could you make an account if you want to discuss this ? your ip - hopping 's starting to confuse me ! : the ip 's arguement can be easily put back at them what about the irish translations of place names that are fairly recent ? acc or ind got imos we have to include the irish version of placenames in the infobox , however many of the modern versions used are provided by [ external link : log ain m ] which creates irish versions of place names . surely many of these placenames ( especially the irish versions of places based on english such as new buildings etc . ) are neologisms that are thus also highly dubious then ? : wikipedia works on sources , the above sources i believe meet reliability and verifiability so that is a weak arguement against them . if anything the ip has to prove that the sources are dubious . his pan ia hrt i do n't dispute the fact that the team referred to themselves as his pan ia racing ; however the vast majority of evidence ( including the fia 's official entry list ) suggests that they were entered as hrt f team : . as far as i can see , only [ external link : this website ] has them entered under the name his pan ia racing . that is why i altered the table on the page . : by jo ve , you 're right . i 'll self - revert .

i do enjoy a good read but as far as i am aware it stopped being the flag in , and was replaced with the union flag , maybe i am mistaken . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : it stopped being the [ wiki link : de jure ] flag in . : yes by law ( as de jur means ) but do you not acknowledge other de facto flags in respect of ni ? preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : i acknowledge plenty of others are used , of course , but on an international level when the need arises to represent ni it 's the banner that 's used . it 's the closest the province has to a government - sanctioned national flag and should be used as such ; just as fifa , p ga tour , the commonwealth games , etc . , do . : yes ni , being a province of the uk , represented at international sports has used different flags in the past aswell being a f fan you would remember one example that springs to mind . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : yes , some race officials once mistakenly flew a tricolour for eddie irvine , who later asked for a special shamrock flag to be flown when he was on the podium ( which fom would n't ) . : yes i remember irvine was not happy as he didnt relate to the tri - colour , even while residing in dublin , it was a stupid act by the fom . jordan racing may have raced under the irish flag but thier other podium finish ers had the correct flags flown . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : \" my helmet 's orange because i 'm a protestant from northern ireland , and it 's got green on it because i do n't want to get shot by the ira . \" ) often mis q outed , here is the full paragraph d \" the orange is because i 'm a protestant from northern ireland , king billy and all that shit . really though , i was just looking for a bright colour , and obviously senna had the yellow , so orange made sense . it 's more a case of the story fitting the colour than the colour fitting the story , if you see what i mean . and the green stripes are for ireland . same pattern as senna 's helmet , see . \" http : www . andrew mueller . net display . las so ?

[ wiki link : pars pro toto ] why are you reverting with the reason that i meant \" britain \" doens ' t mean great britain ( i . e . the island ) ? i 've added in that \" britain \" is sometimes used to mean \" united kingdom \" . \" britain \" does mean \" great britain \" it even says it in the [ wiki link : great britain ] article . it is defined as such in the collins english dictionary and the oxford english dictionary . : have self - reverted for now . my issue is that [ wiki link : britain ( pl ac ename ) britain ] is n't just a name for an island that 's been applied to a larger state it originally referred to [ wiki link : brit ann y ] ( \" little britain \" ) and its inhabitants and later to a roman province , so i 'm not sure it 's strictly appropriate here . the usage to mean great britain is much more modern . : i understand . there 's probably lots of examples where \" britain \" has a different meaning . but equally valid and true are examples where \" britain \" ( and even \" great britain \" ) are used to mean \" united kingdom \" . btw , equally your addition of \" ireland \" to [ wiki link : to tum pro parte ] is not correct . it explains that in geography , some placenames are commonly used to refer sy non ymously to a larger area than is strictly deemed correct but in this case , use of \" ireland \" to refer to the state * is * correct . the name does not incorrectly refer to a larger area it can be used to correctly refer to the smaller area also . unlike \" america \" for the usa . : i 've just re - read that part of [ wiki link : to tum pro parte ] and realised it 's the article that 's wrong ! surely it should be \" some placenames are commonly used to refer sy non ymously to a smaller area than is strictly deemed correct \" ? the united states is smaller than the americas , northern ireland smaller than ulster , ireland ( the republic of ) smaller than ireland ( the island ) . : well spotted . it 's used when a part is referred to by mentioning the whole . so people say \" america \" ( the whole ) when the mean usa ( the part ) . in your case by adding \" ireland \" , you 're incorrectly stating that people say \" ireland \" when they mean the state and not the island . this is not an example of [ wiki link : to tum pro parte ] because it is correct . it is not an error . it is incorrect to infer that the island is the \" whole \" , and that the \" state \" is the part . if someone says \" i live in ireland \" , this does not mean that the person is referring to the island to mean the state , since the name of the state is also \" ireland \" . : britain is an official short form of the uk used by the british government , so if we 're going down the official usage path it 's also not incorrect to refer to the uk as \" britain \" . do you have a problem with the re - worded sentence i added ? : britain an official short form ? i do n't think it is . is there a ref for that anywhere ? : it 's on the [ wiki link : terminology of the british isles ] article , ref 'd with the [ external link : guardian style guide ] . : fair enough , it says what it says in the guardian style guide . but i do n't think that it is right and i do n't think there 's anything official about it . in the [ wiki link : great britain ] article , it says the term britain , as opposed to great britain , has been used to mean the united kingdom , for example in official government yearbooks between and . since , however , the yearbooks have only used the term \" united kingdom \" - that seems to indicate that it is n't official . your reworded sentence is fine . i 'd really prefer if you address sed the [ wiki link : to tum pro parte ] article - it 's not even intended as a list , so including a example that is n't correct ( and at the very least , unsupported and unreferenced ) just strikes me unnecessary and perhaps could be interpreted as a little pointy . : yearbooks or no yearbooks , \" britain \" is still used by hm government on a pretty regular basis : [ external link : this ] website , for example , only launched a few months ago , with a mandate for \" celebrating , inspiring and accelerating enterprise in the uk \" . i meant the ireland sentence on the [ wiki link : to tum pro parte ] article when i was talking about \" my reworded sentence \" that 's a yes , then ! i do n't honestly see how it 's much different to the \" ulster \" example next to it , other than in the sense of official government usage is that what you 're pushing for here ? the powers that be in northern ireland used \" ulster \" for ni in an official capacity right up until the whole ugly business of the late s ; would you have accepted ulster being stripped out if we were writing this encyclopaedia years ago ? just trying to understand where you 're coming from . best , to correctly be considered \" pars pro toto \" , using the name of the larger entity must be strictly \" incorrect \" when referring to the smaller entity , hence using \" ulster \" instead of \" northern ireland \" . by including the \" ireland \" example , what you 're actually saying is that it is strictly incorrect to use \" ireland \" to refer to the state , when in actual fact it is not incorrect at all . on that basis , you could equally include \" ireland \" in the \" to tum pro parte \" article as an example of using \" ireland \" to refer to the island , which would be an equally incorrect example . the example of \" great britain \" instead of uk is a good example of this ( although there 's a case that \" britain \" is n't a particularly good example , depending on which dictionary definition you rely on ) . : you have n't really addressed my point here . why is ulster any more incorrect than \" ireland \" ? because it 's no longer a name with any official currency ? : just looked back at this and think i understand what you 're saying a bit more now , but i still disagree . ireland the island civilisation is the origin of the name and has had that meaning since time immemorial ; ireland the state has existed for - odd years , so it 's clear the state is named after the island . equally , if \" britain \" is used by officially by the uk and its government , by your reasoning we could include ( great ) britain on the [ wiki link : to tum pro parte ] page as an example of its usage to mean the uk is also applied to the island . that , of course , would be wrong as it meant the island first it 's the same with ireland . : this reminds me of b ise ; - ) : jon , do you mind if this discussion gets moved to the article talk page ? : in response - dealing with ireland first in to tum pro parte . first off , yes , the name of the island is the origin of the name of the state . no question . whether it is a [ wiki link : sy nec do che ] has nothing to do with what was named \" first \" - in fact , language changes all the time and meanings change , so what might have been an example in the past may no longer be an example . but for it to be \" to tum pro parte \" the term for the whole must be used to refer to a part of it . so the whole is the island , ireland . the part of the island , the state , is also ireland . how can you refer to \" ireland \" the island to refer to \" ireland \" the state and it 's clear that the whole is only referring to the part ? is there an example where the island is referred to as meaning the state ( and not just the state actually being referred to ? ) i understand what you are trying to say , but you are incorrect . on a pr ac tic aly note , i struggle to come up with a meaningful example . for example , if you say \" ireland uses the euro \" , you ca n't say that is an example of referring to the island to actually mean the state , because \" ireland \" is the actual name of the state , so that usage is correct and not an example of to tum pro parte . it would make perfect sense if the name of the state was something different , like \" republic of ireland \" - but it 's not . : in relation to you comments on britain . i found [ external link : this old page ] where it says on this site the term britain ' is used informally to mean the united kingdom of great britain and northern ireland . if you accept that the island is called \" britain \" , this is an example \" pars pro toto \" ( and not of to tum pro parte as you said above ) where a part ( the island ) is used to refer to the whole ( the uk ) . if , on the other hand , the \" meaning \" of britain has changed to refer to the uk , then it should n't be used as an example . in this case ( and due to the find of the archived page ) , i 'd probably leave out the \" britain \" part because it is n't a good example - it 's what i was alluding to above when i said \" although there 's a case that \" britain \" is n't a particularly good example , depending on which dictionary definition you rely on \" . : i think you are more likely to find an example where someone uses [ wiki link : england ] when they actually mean uk . : still waiting jon . and can we move this to the article talk page . f mph - my point exactly . how can you create an example where someone uses \" ireland \" when they actually mean \" ireland \" . : i 've removed it . : thanks jon . : no probs . i know what i 'm trying to say but do n't really have the time or energy ( or perhaps mental faculty ) to argue my case any more . i suppose it does come down to official , gov ' t - sanctioned usage in the end . you 're probably right on this one . : official government sanctioned usage ? oh that would open up a whole can of worms for [ wiki link : derry some ] [ wiki link : republic of ireland articles ] . would n't be the first time the governments sanctioned usage was ignored . : could n't agree more , especially regarding both those articles . : bit confused , hk . i was conceding that you were right owing to the fact the irish state calls itself \" ireland \" officially ! : um - do n't think we 're disagreeing . so as controversial it this might be , the derry article should be located at londonderry , in my opinion , cos that 's the official name . the republic of ireland article should be at \" ireland \" - although it ca n't because the island article is located there . so it should be at a different title . given the historical connotations and implications associated with \" republic of ireland \" , an alternative title would be better . not really pushed as to what alternative - something like \" ireland ( republic ) \" would be fine by me . : fair enough . i 'm pro - status quo , but that 's another chat for another page . belfast hi jon chap ple , i 'm sure you are already aware that belfast is under rr troubles restriction . to be honest i agree with both the ip and republican jacobite that your edit [ external link : here ] does not have consensus so i suggest that you take it to the talkpage . : oops ! no , i 'd completely forgotten . shite . there 's no way to revert my edits without undoing everyone else 's too , is there ? : i 've added a tag to the talk page , lest other people also forget . : i would just leave it for now as technically the ip reverts do n't count . : so how come it 's under rr ? because it was the centre of a lot of the violence ? to be honest i did n't forget i did n't know it was covered . are all major ni cities covered by the troubles restrictions ? : to be honest virtually any ni related article could be considered part of the restriction . i think they say if in doubt consider that it is . i think you were just about to get into an edit war anyway so best playing by the book . : what 's your opinion , by the way ? are you in agreement with the ip and rj ? : yes you do n't have consensus for the change so go to the talkpage . you do n't want to get into trouble after you have just received a barnstar ) btw i do n't think the barnstar is displaying on the userpage ? : heh , i meant about the info itself , rather than my trying to include it . is it not working for you ? they 're supposed to be in a drop - down box at the bottom with a \" show \" button works on my computer but maybe not for other people . ? : it was collapsed and i did n't initial see it ) as for the edit i do n't know if adding a note that something comes th in any list is worth anything . in fact just checked the discussion and [ external link : here ] is my comment . i noticed that others have now joined the reverting . btw i see that we both share an interest in ireland motorsport ! : you 're right , i knew i 'd come across you somewhere else . are you looking forward to su zu ka ? to be honest i hope ve ttel walks it , would rather the boy just gets the championship out of the way so we can concentrate on the racing again . it 's been a cracking season on track , even if the title has been a walk over . : been a great season . i 'm an alonso fan but my motorsport interest goes beyond f into wrc , irc , sport scars and cars in general and porsche in particular . : i used to follow the bt cc and wrc when i were a lad , but gradually lost interest . tried to get into indy car but it does nothing for me . i only got back into f last year . switched off during the ( yawn ) schumacher years . i support your edit , jon chap ple . last time i checked , belfast was within the united kingdom . : thanks , gd . you would certainly be correct on that front . rfc i 've raised an rfc for [ wiki link : talk : king s mi ll massacre names of victims ] to get some outside opinions . : nice one . think that 's probably a good move . : thanks . i 'll be interested to see what comes in . : the rfc responses from the genuinely impartial and uninvolved show what reasonable editors think . it 's encouraging to know that there 's some impartiality on wikipedia . it might still prove necessary to take this further if there 's still not a consensus . regards and thanks for the advice . : do n't mention it . it was your idea and it 's proved very successful indeed . i think rfcs may be a good avenue for these sorts of disagreements for the future as you say , once the usual suspects are taken out the equation the response is often very different . : hi there . hope you 're enjoying your motorsport . despite the rfc we 've not got a consensus , though bj m ul lan seems to have noted the contributions no - one else seems to have moved . so the next step i think is mediation . it 's not clear if you could currently edit the talk page but it 's possible ( see [ externa link : http : en . wikipedia . org wiki user talk : killerchihuahua block query ] ) . do you want to ask about that , or i could ? i think any mediation would be de valued if you , or anyone else , could n't take part . regards . appears to be an inexperienced editor , perhaps if you engaged the user in discussion directly rather than through edit summaries , it might yield better results to end his edit warring . although i must admit i too am a little concerned over the use of an encyclopedia to cite another encyclopedia . perhaps a better source can be found or more agreeable wording can be reached . : fair point . i 'll leave a message on their talk , although i 'm not sure how much good it 'll do . : kudos , nice editing on [ wiki link : kenneth bran agh ] ! in regards to . , at least you will be able to say you tried . ukip valid point , but wanting english independence is not the same as a devolved england with same status as the other countries of the uk . : i know , but that article covers au ton om ist movements too . it would be incorrect to have ukip and the english democrats in the proposed state section above , as they do n't want full independence like the england first party , but they do want a parliament and autonomy for england so they 're correct where they are . best , thanks thank you sir for your message on my page ) ive learnt my lesson now and ive been unblocked ) : do n't mention it . just try to stay out of trouble . ; ) tar ring and fe a thering in northern ireland hi jon , remember our discussion about people having been tar red and feathered in northern ireland ?

[ \" truth \" emerges here . ] : [ need to figure out \" class \" and \" flg ( ) \" all formulas and axioms \" closed under the relation immediate consequence \" ] : [ again it does seem strange that fin sler 's and godel 's undecidable questions did not answer the entscheidungsproblem to everyone 's sat si faction . why ? ] : as it does not bear on de ci dability , put in a footnote [ ? } : with regards to \" completeness \" : godel demonstrates that pe ano arithmetic p is powerful enough to express , in p itself ( he shows how to do this in footnote ) , the [ wiki link : meta mathematical ] statement \" arithmetic p is consistent \" . but as a consequence of his \" undecidability theorem \" iv , \" the sentence which asserts that x [ an arbitrary recursive consistent class ] is consistent is not x - provable ; in particular the consistency of p is unprovable in p , provided p is consistent ( in the contrary of course , every statement is provable ) \" ( g del 's theorem xi , godel : in the undecidable ) . thus in pe ano arithmetic p there exists at least one statement that can not be proven \" consistent \" or \" inconsistent \" ; this fact makes p incomplete . but worse , just as theorem states , the statement p is consistent can not be proved within p itself . so in effect , g del got \" two for one \" . given that godel was able to display \" undecidable sentences [ propositions ] \" gandy can now answer the question posed above about what happens when we submit our entscheidungsproblem algorithm to itself for testing : \" for any such system g del constructs a formula which is sa tis fiable , but for which this fact can not be proved in . as a consequence , given any proposed algorithm for the entscheidungsproblem and any system , either it can not be proved in that always gives an answer , or it can not be proved in that its answer is always correct . \" ( gandy : ) so why did n't g del just go ahead and prove the undecidability of the entscheidungsproblem ? gandy supposes that first \" one needed to reflect long and hard on the idea of cal c ul ability \" ( gandy : ) . the ever - cautious g del was unconvinced that either church 's - de fin ability or even his own forms of \" recursion \" ( [ wiki link : primitive recursion ] in g del , eventually augmented into \" her brand - g del \" recursion by the mid - 's ) was adequate to the task . besides , the question requires finite means , and g del was more interested in \" non fin ist concepts and methods \" ( gandy : ) . so , the third question the entscheidungsproblem would have to wait until the mid - 's . - : effective cal c ul ability : - calculus ? recursion ? machine computation ? the problem was : an answer to the entscheidungsproblem first required a precise characterization a definition , an hypothesis conjecture , or better yet , an a xi om ization of the notion of \" definite general applicable prescription \" or what [ wiki link : alon zo church ] would come to call \" [ wiki link : effective cal c ul ability ] ( cf part \" . the notion of effective cal c ul ability \" in church : in the undecidable ) . even the form of the characterization should it be a definition , or a hypothesis , or an a xi om ization ? would come under debate . in no such characterization existed . but over the next years princeton professor church and his two students [ wiki link : stephen kleene ] and [ wiki link : j . b . ross er ] would propose a \" definition \" by use of church 's [ wiki link : - calculus ] and her brand - g del 's [ wiki link : recursion theory ] i . e . g del 's [ wiki link : primitive recursion ] modified by a suggestion of [ wiki link : jacques her brand ] . then [ wiki link : emil post ] would propose his so - called \" working hypothesis \" ( of a worker moving from room to room writing and erasing marks per a list of instructions ) ( post ) , and lastly a few months later ( - ) [ wiki link : alan turing ] would follow up with his proposed \" a - ( automatic ) machine \" ( closer to an a xi om ization but still not considered by some to be fully a xi om ati zed , cf gandy , sieg , mo s cho v ak is , dershowitz and gu rev ich ) . : church 's proof indeed , church 's paper ( presented to the american mathematical society april , published april ) showed that an undecidable problem did exist . church states the purpose of his paper this way : \" the purpose of the present paper is to propose a definition of effective cal c ul ability which is thought to correspond satisfactorily to the somewhat vague intuition notion . and show , by means of an example , that not every problem of this class is solvable . \" in footnote , church states that \" definition of effective cal c ul ability can be stated in either of two equivalent forms , ( ) . if it is - de fin able , ( ) . it is recursive in the sense of [ her brand - godel modified by kleene ] \" ( u . p . ) . furthermore in this definition he uses the criterion \" the algorithm has terminated becomes effectively known \" ( u p . ) . an explanation of church 's example is beyond the reach of this article . gandy explains ( cf gandy : - ) that within all the undecidability proofs ( church 's , kleene 's and turing 's ) the method involves ( ) enumeration an algorithmic - like method to list all possible well - formed functions f of a single variable m , assign a number to m , convert each par ame tri zed - function \" f of m \" fm to a g del number g ( fm ) , and put the g ( fm ) in numerical order ; ( ) a successful demonstration that each par ame ter ized - function fm ( and as a consequence its g deli zation g ( fm ) is a [ wiki link : total function ] , i . e . to match the g deli zed g ( fm ) to the correct g deli zed answer g ( n ) , ( ) use of cantor 's diagonal method to derive a contradiction when the function f is the decision procedure d acting on its own number i . e . g ( d ( d ) ? g ( \" true \" ? or \" false \" ? ) . within the year church would go on to strengthen his result , and in a paper titled a note on the entscheidungsproblem ( april ) he would show that : \" the general case of the entscheidungsproblem of the [ logical ] system l is un solvable . \" : \" . the entscheidungsproblem of a system of symbolic logic is here understood [ in the sense of what is called the \" de du ci bility problem \" below , that is , as ] the problem to find an effective method by which , given any expression q in the notation of the system , it can be determined whether or not q is provable in the system . hilbert and ack erman ( loc . cit ) understand the entscheidungsproblem of the eng ere funk tion en kal k l [ first order functional calculus ] in a slightly different sense . but the two senses are equivalent in view of the proof by kurt g del and the completeness of the eng ere funk tion en kal k l . \" ( brackets in the original , church ' the undecidable ' p . ) church sees two forms of the question : ( i ) \" a constructive proof of the un sol v ability of what we may call the \" de du ci bility problem \" of the eng ere funk tion en kal k l , that is the problem to find an effective procedure which is capable of determining , about any given expression in the notation of the eng ere funk tion en kal k l , whether it is de ci dable in that system ; ( ii ) \" . a procedure for determining universal validity , [ that ] depends upon the non - constructively proved theorem of g del that every universally valid expression is de ducible in the eng ere funk tion en kal k l , as well as on the assumption of the converse of this , that every de ducible expression is universally valid . \" church wondered had he proven case ( ii ) beyond a doubt ? his proof relies upon g del 's completeness theorem ( i . e . his phd thesis , not his so - called incompleteness theorems ) , and church noted ( and davis rei ter ates on : - , and in : - ) that this is a \" non - constructive \" proof i . e . it relies on the use of [ wiki link : reductio ad ab sur dum ] and consequently , the [ wiki link : law of excluded middle ] , an an athe ma to mathematicians with an in tu i tion istic outlook . - : a flurry of activity church beat [ wiki link : alan turing ] to the punch by almost a year ( turing 's paper received may , published january ) . without knowledge that church - kleene - ross er at princeton had been working on the same problem , turing , a master 's student at king 's college , cambridge uk , was approaching his characterization of \" effective cal c ul ability \" from a much different angle . and , the appearance of church 's proof spurred [ wiki link : emil post ] to publish ; he too had been working in obscurity for a number of years , and he quickly submitted a brief paper in the fall of that offered as his \" working hypothesis \" of \" effective cal c ul ability \" a \" process \" ( a man moving through a sequence of boxes marking and erasing per a list of instructions ) very similar to turing 's a - machine . moreover in a footnote he took a poke at church 's notion of a \" definition \" for effective cal c ul ability : church 's definition would \" mask this identification under a definition [ and hide ] the fact that a fundamental discovery in the limitations of the ma the ma tic izing power of homo sapiens has been made and blin ds us to the need of its continual verification . \" ( footnote , post : in the undecidable ) . although turing 's submission of his paper ( received may ) gave him a few months ' priority over post , post 's paper published first and church had to certify that post 's work was independent of turing 's . church and [ wiki link : paul bern ays ] refereed turing 's paper from spring through the fall ; bern ays found errors in turing 's last proof and turing had to modify it . but this gave turing time to study church 's paper and add , in august , an appendix where he s ket ched a proof that church 's - calculus and his a - machines would compute the same functions . church would in turn defend himself against post 's criticism by suggesting that \" to define effectiveness as com pu tability by an arbitrary machine subject to the restrictions of fin i teness would seem to be an adequate representation of the ordinary notion , and if this is done the need for [ post 's ] working hypothesis would disappear . \" ( cf church in gandy : ) . : \" but what church had done was something rather different , and in a certain sense weaker . the turing construction was more direct , and provided an argument from first principles , closing the gap in church 's demonstration . \" ( hodges p . ) . - turing 's proof most of turing 's paper describes \" effective cal c ul ability \" in terms of \" com pu table numbers are those whose dec im als are cal c ul able by finite means \" ( p . ) , in other words , his a - machines . he sets up an enumeration to be done by his universal machine u ; it provides a \" circle - deciding machine d \" with numbers to test for \" cir c ul arity \" , starting with \" and continuing in numerical sequence , ( i . e . in modern terms , each number represents a programs to be tested for \" un ending loops \" ) . he then proves , first , that his universal en um er ator circle - deciding program h u d can not decide whether h ( i . e . itself ) will or will not end in \" a circle \" ( a never - ending loop ) . ( by assumption : it must never loop , but rather it must go on testing forever . but when it tests itself , its actions are to start with and proceed , number by number , to test each one by definition this is a circle and violates the premise . ) by use of this result , turing then proves that no universal deciding program e can tell if any machine m \" ever prints a given symbol ( say ) . \" armed with this second proof he goes on to prove that : \" the hilbert entscheidungsproblem can have no solution . there can be no general process for determining whether a given formula u of the functional calculus k is provable , i . e . that there can be no machine which , supplied with any one u of these formulae , will eventually say whether u is provable . \" ( u . p . ) explanation of this proof is beyond the scope of this article . it involves g deli zations of \" complete configurations \" of a - machines and subsequent attempts to match them to g deli zed \" answers \" , with failure as the ultimate outcome . - : post 's \" working hypothesis \" in his paper post only proposed his \" working hypothesis \" of \" a process \" and criticized church 's \" definition \" , but had proved nothing . rather , post maintained a more phi los op hi c stance . he hoped to publish a series of \" wider and wider formulations . the success of the program would for us , change this hypothesis not so much to a definition or to an axiom but to a natural law \" ( post : in the undecidable ) in later years post remained skeptical of church 's definition of effective cal c ul ability ( kleene 's \" thesis i \" of , named \" church 's thesis \" by kleene in ) and turing 's a - machines ( named \" turing 's thesis \" by kleene in ) . in a paper post submitted in and had rejected ( subsequently published in by davis in the undecidable ) he pon ders the notion of , and the nature of , undecidability : \" . the phrase \" absolutely un solvable \" is due to church .

      "proposed merger does anyone object to a merger into dead pool ? of [ wiki link : death pool ] into this article ? if not , i will attempt the merge . * go for it , sir . * i second that . * definitely merger completed ! redirecting accordingly please stop the edit war would all users please stop the edit war by reverting each others changes re : the death list website . please discuss the issues here and let 's come to a consensus about the best way to incorporate this information in the article . thank you . i am not sure that site belongs at all in the article except in the external links area . it is not a notable web forum it exists only on the web and its alexa rankings are very low . low alexa rankings can be excused if the entity had a life outside of the web , but this is n't the case here such a non - notable site does not deserve half this article . i have even conceded to leave a longer - than - deserving paragraph about it ( which includes contributions from more than one person ) . the information that keeps getting replaced without justification resembles a vanity page more than anything else , is poorly written , and o vere mph asi zes the \" importance \" of this non - notable entity . the death list itself is monitored by the uk media . that can be proved by its recent mention in the sun , which has the highest circulation of any english - language newspaper in the world . and , as a working british journalist myself , i can happily state that the death list is more known than any other dead pool , or perhaps the who dead pool format . given that the whole of wikipedia is , in my opinion , starting to resemble a diary of an angst - ridden teen , i can not believe [ user : qu at loo qu at al oo ] is even arguing against the death list being included more fully . if you want to take a look at the sort of toot that should n't be on here , i suggest you visit [ wiki link : ca n't sleep , clown will eat me ] . now that is pointless ! : i have read that coverage , and i disagree . merely being covered once or twice does not make something notable , that falls into human interest genre of coverage and there are thousands of individuals and events in such stories every day which nobody would consider notable other than fleet ingly . the proof is in the pudding , in this case , the web traffic , which is quite quantifiable and in this case truly negligible . the fact is , very few people visit that site . : ok , having read the comments and looked at the article history , let me try to summarize everyone 's positions , in the hope of reaching a compromise everyone can live with . in e tern um , rm hed , and gre t nag od were proponents of keeping the separate death list entry . after the afd debate resulted in a merge , they have edited the article to include a separate section til ted \" dead pool variant \" talking about the deathlist . net site . their position seems to be that the site is su f fic ine tly notable and different from a \" traditional \" dead pool that it needs a separate section . they also note press coverage that the site has received as indicative of its notability . user qu at loo argues that the site is not particularly notable due to its low web traffic , and that a couple of press mentions do not warrant giving the site a separate section in the article . s he does not object to an external link to the site , but would prefer the site not be mentioned in the body of the text . s he also objects to some of the phrasing the other users have proposed . as a compromise position , s he has written a brief description of the deathlist site for inclusion in the body of the text , without giving it a section . have i fairly summarized everyone 's positions ? as i have stated elsewhere , i believe the deathlist website is indeed notable enough to receive the relatively small entry rm hed keeps re - in stating . i do not understand why qu al too has taken issue with the deathlist entry ; surely there are many other much less deserving wikipedia articles - including the growing number of articles written about fictional characters ( ! ) - to which qu al too 's somewhat obsessive attention could be put to better use . qu al too implies , in his her note above , that the inclusion of anything not \" approved \" by him herself equates to \" vanity \" on the part of the poster , and yet has the audacity to refer to \" conceding \" to allow a longer deathlist entry . who are you to decide what should be included and what should n't ? it is not your place to override a ' merge ' decision , which everyone else was willing to accept , for whatever your personal reasons are . as noted by t ms , it would appear that there are ( at least ) three individuals who wish to see the longer dl entry remain , as opposed to one individual who does n't . if wikipedia prides itself on its democratic nature , then i suggest , qu al too , that you consider the proof that is in that pudding . the only person who seems to have a problem with the \" dead pool variant \" edit is qu at loo . this version is less than half the original deathlist article size , and is a fair compromise , comm en sur ate with the merge decision . : thank you all for posting your thoughts here . i want to point out that [ wiki link : wp : not wikipedia is not a democracy ] . if two or more editors disagree about the content of an article , it should be resolved through discussion and an attempt to reach a consensus , rather than a \" vote \" and majority rules . i would ask that everyone [ wiki link : wp : faith assume good faith ] , and avoid questioning the motives of other editors . this can feel like a [ wiki link : wp : npa personal attack ] , and does not help us reach consensus . let 's focus our attention on improving this article , and not get distracted by the many other ar icles in wikipedia that need attention . i believe both the shorter paragraph qu at loo has agreed to support and the full section the other editors wish to insert would constitute a \" merge \" as agreed in the afd discussion . i think the key issue is whether giving deathlist . net a separate section in the article gives [ wiki link : wp : npov undue weight undue weight ] to that one website . to help us answer that question , can editors provide links to news references other than the two cited in the article that help support the notability of the site ? thank you all again for participating in this discussion . : the alexa rank of the site in question is , . even a rank of half that would not make the site notable . i have already conceded that it can have a paragraph , a recognition of notability that it does not truly deserve . wikipedia is not a place for vanity information about websites . if that were the case there would be , articles on them . furthermore there is nothing specifically notable about what death list actually is . it has a dead pool there are hundreds of these . the notability claim seems to rest on the fact that it has forums which is even less notable . wikipedia is full of articles about non - notable subjects people , notability is a red herring . how very nice of qu at loo to concede that we can have a par ag rag h , not at all patronizing . deathlist is not a dead pool if qu at loo knew anything about dead pools he 'd realise this . : it is a dead pool by the definition of this article . the consensus we had on the deletion of the death list article was merge . admittedly , qu al too has been very unreasonable about this in the past , but i thought we had come to a compromise that we could leave it with a small paragraph . when ( not if ) death list gets bigger and more notable , we can renew this discussion . i do believe , however , that rm hed , in e tern um and gre t nag od should be the ones to decide what constitutes the paragraph not qu al too . let 's agree for now to keep it small but with content control reverted to people who actually know something about the topic , not just someone who wishes to keep it short . : forgot to sign in . i must disagree with a couple of the points raised in your last comment , and i do not do so to be inflammatory , but because i believe that they are fundamental to the discussion at hand . first of all , i did not state that wikipedia is a democracy , i stated that wikipedia is democratic in nature , as i believe it is . wikipedia is built on the principle that there is a community of people adding to , and amending , a common pool of knowledge , which is then to be shared . it was through democratic negotiations that the original deathlist page became merged with the dead pool page . if individuals who participate in the compilation of knowledge provided within wikipedia do not believe that this compilation should occur within a democratic vein , they should perhaps consider editing their own encyclopedia , where they will have autonomous control over what is included or not . surely autonomous control is not the point of wikipedia , or it would not exist in the format that it does . i therefore contend that the wishes of one individual , no matter how persistent , should not override those of several , especially in circumstances such as these , where the very definition of what is being discussed is not agreed upon . qu al too suggests that the deathlist qualifies as a dead pool , as dead pools are herein defined . i would contend that the definition of what a dead pool is , as it stands in this entry , is too vague . dead pools require , by their very nature , that individual players select their own teams ' of celebrities who they believe will die . these individual players then compete against each other to win ' . under this more specific definition , the deathlist is definitely not a dead pool , but a variation thereof . therefore , it should remain as a dead pool variation . secondly , i believe that it is impossible to discuss the notability of any wikipedia entry without considering it in the context of all other wikipedia articles . i agree that to simply start citing examples of other poorly written articles is unconstructive . however , how can the definition of what makes something \" notable \" be established without context ? would articles in obscure , non - notable magazines outweigh two articles in highly circulated , international newspapers ? from what i understand , the deathlist administration have turned down requests for interviews in the past ; thus , although the interviews do not appear in the media , the deathlist is indeed \" notable \" . finally , although i am unable to provide links , i believe that the deathlist was both a guardian ( uk ) ' site of the day ' , as well as a yahoo ! ' pick ' . : if something lives only on the web , as death list does , it can be compared to other websites using alexa . for things that live outside the web such as personalities , corporations , real - world events , etc . this is not a valid measure . often this is because pre - web history is under - represented on the web , and historical figures will appear fewer times mentioned than if they were presently alive . but death list is just a web forum and as such it is very easy to establish its lack of notability . : unsurprisingly , i disagree with this reasoning . if the only other entries in wikipedia were websites , then i would accept this measurement as sufficient , as there would then be across - the - board standards . however , you can not make use of such an ex l usive measuring system when other entries in wikipedia are not quantifiable thus . alexa denotes notability as compared to other websites only . furthermore , as with most quantitative analysis , alexa talks only in numbers : it does not enable an examination of who visitors to the website are . for example , which is more \" notable \" : a website visited by , teens , in passing , as they visit hundred of other websites each night , or a website visited by top - ranking government officials and journalists , who visit that website exclusively ? ( obviously , i 'm not at all suggesting that either is the case with regard to the deathlist , i 'm merely making a general point . ) this is the problem with quantitative research ; the number are just that : only numbers . they do not attest to the quality or value of what is being quantified . therefore , although i grant that the alexa measurement may been seen as one indicator it is not enough , in this setting , upon which to base decisions . mortal kombat ii ? i was just trying to figure out why a video arcade game that as far as i know has no references to a \" dead pool \" would be linked from here . unless there is a reason i think it should be removed . done . sho sti e external link to deathlist are external links to something that is part of the article out of place ? i 'm amazed removal of deathlist and the solution to the above is to remove it altogether , is the consensus view now or just the view of the person ( s ? ) who 's deleted it ? : gon na re - add it . no need for an edit war . ' major omission ; merge ? this is n't even so much as cross - referenced to [ wiki link : assassination politics ] . the two should probably just be merged\n",

      "hi , i 'm just throwing out what follows as food for thought . one of the reasons i took ( am currently taking ) an interest in the \" squad table \" section of your current season article was ( is ) to try and determine how much of what i 've seen written about how much the new \" epl squad registration \" ruling for the upcoming season is actually going to adversely affect manchester city . to my mind the first step in solving this issue was to determine which players are actually in the overall first team squad from which the players will ultimately be chosen for epl registration . with the recent round of edits to the \" player statistics table ( pst ) \" the mcfc \" potential first team squad \" is finally beginning to look correct - and i fully concur that determining the actual makeup of this squad is as much art as it is science , but that is a topic of discussion for a separate section of your talk page . before i started this \" exercise \" i was convinced that much of what i was reading wrt to how severely the new registration ruling would de tri mentally affect manchester city was absolute pi ffle put out by people who do n't know what they are talking about , or who have an anti - man . city agenda ( e . g . , arsenal supporters ! ) , or both . if many other soccer fans are as currently baffled as i was by this new registration ruling - wrt how it actually affects each of the individual epl clubs , and in particular , the ones they follow or support - it got me thinking as to where they are going to turn to get their questions answered . an obvious answer is the various wikipedia articles for the respective clubs . so i think there is a very strong argument for updating your season article to better reflect accurate and verifiable information that pertains to this issue which , from this season onwards , will affect the playing validity in epl fixtures of the vast majority of first team players currently on the books of all epl clubs . imo this is not a topic that can just be \" shrugged off \" ! it really needs to be addressed - and soon , while the interest and curiosity is out there , making any web article ( on wikipedia or elsewhere ) extremely useful in people 's ongoing search for answers . in a month 's time this issue might be completely moot ; just like the new squad numbers . but how , amongst all the drivel and speculation that is currently being sp outed out there in the press , on tv , and particularly on the web , does one determine \" accurate and verifiable information \" worthy of being displayed in the article rather than re gress it with the addition of a lot of un ci table ( and thus inde fen sible ) idle speculation and gossip ? this is my attempt to come up with something that could be usefully added to the pst ( in a new column to the left of the players ' names ) that is ( or can be made to be ) both \" accurate and ci tably verifiable \" information contained in that table . the approach was a - step one . first , understand what the new epl registration ruling actually mandates ( most people 's opinion on this issue falls at this first hurdle ) and how it differs from the existing squad registration rules that uefa already have in place for clubs competing in the champions league and europa league competitions . second , understand the actual ages and early career paths of the individual players in question ( and most , if not all , of this information is currently out there in their personal wikipedia articles , and if not there , in comparable bios for those players posted on the official club web sites ) . third , correctly apply the ruling of the first step to the information gathered in the second step to come up with a clear classification for each player than can be easily displayed ( and subsequently maintained ) in the \" season - \" wikipedia article for that club . and in the specific case of manchester city , in the pst section of that article . i set out below the results of my pursuit of that strategy . i may have made errors at each of the three steps , but just like setting out each step of a mathematical proof , these can be spotted by others and corrected to yield the correct answer instead of my initial erroneous one . such errors do not invalidate my methodology ; only its application in a few specific cases . so here are the results of my first pass at coming to grips with this fascinating issue . step a - understanding the new epl player registration ruling : starting with the upcoming - season , every epl team will only be able to field a player in epl matches that does not meet the ' under player ' provision ( see below ) if he has been registered with the fa before the end of the summer transfer window . each epl team can register no more than such players , although less than that number may be registered . any player that does meet the ' under player ' provision does not have to be registered in this ( up to ) - man squad in order to be eligible to play in epl matches during the season . : within every epl team 's ( up to ) - man registered squad , slots must be reserved only for players that meet the ' homegrown player ' provision ( see below ) . if an epl team chooses ( or is unable ) to register the maximum players permitted for these slots then any unused ' homegrown player ' slots will be for fe ited . an epl team may register more than players that meet the ' homegrown player ' provision up to a maximum of the - man maximum for the squad . : an epl team may also register in a similar manner any number of players ( up to a maximum of ) that do not meet the ' homegrown player ' provision . however , the total number of both types of \" over \" players so registered can not exceed the - man maximum for the squad . : homegrown player provision : a \" homegrown player \" is defined as one who , irrespective of his nationality or age , has been registered with any club affiliated to the football association or the welsh football association for a period , continuous or not , of three entire seasons or months prior to his st birthday ( or the end of the season during which he turns ) . : under player provision : for a young player to meet this provision he must be younger than years of age , or have turned years of age after january of the year in which the season starts , on the first day of the season ( viz . for this upcoming season ) . thus many qualifying players will already be years of age come the start of the season in question . step b - understanding the differences ( if any ) between the uefa and epl player registration requirements : it is my understanding that the epl player registration requirements pretty well parallel the uefa player registration requirements with the following difference . the uefa squad registration requirements for \" homegrown players \" are a little sti f fer ; of the \" homegrown player \" slots can only be filled by players that have qualified for that status via the club 's own academy . step - applying the epl ruling to the current manchester city first team squad : the results of this process are shown in my comments notes to the right hand side of most players ' names in the \" step \" section below . i have not even bothered with such notes for players that obviously do not meet the \" homegrown \" nor \" under \" provisions ; i only did so in marginal cases ( such as just missing out on the \" under \" provision ( e . g . , j r me boat eng ) or the \" homegrown \" provision ( e . g . , patrick vie ira ) . now that vie ira comment may well have made you raise your eyebrows , but one of the things that surprised me in executing this undertaking was how much i had misunderstood the requirements of the new ruling . until i actually executed step above , i had previously believed ( and this was probably sub consciously influenced by the uefa requirements ) that the \" homegrown \" players had to have accumulated their required years of \" under \" registered service in the actual academy of the club in question ( and city are still in great shape even if that was the case ) instead of being a registered player with any english or welsh club ( and not even being required to have participated in those clubs ' academies ; thus three years playing only for the first team of an english or welsh club between the ages of and still satisfies the \" homegrown \" provision as i currently understand it ) . : which immediately made me think : when did wenger bring vie ira into arsenal ? if he had signed vie ira as an year old ( and wenger usually signs up his young french foreign players at an age much younger than that ) , and vie ira had played his first three seasons for arsenal ( whether in the first team or not ) between the ages of and , then patrick would have met the \" homegrown \" provision . in fact , applying this provision to the city squad was quite an eye - opener for me . before starting this exercise i had assumed ( like i think most other people are assuming ) that the stiff competition at city for an epl squad place was for one of the \" other \" places in the - man squad , and not for one of the \" homegrown \" places ( for which city have more than enough good senior academy graduates to completely utilize ) . of course , there still is stiff competition , but it has more to do with how many of city 's hgp ac p players bleed beyond the mandated \" homegrown \" slots into the other slots that only the \" foreign \" ( not \" homegrown \" ) players can use . it looks extremely likely to me that mancini will register more than \" homegrown \" players in his two - man squads , but if he registers more than \" homegrown \" players it will effectively de pri ve places in the two squads to some of city 's more famous foreign \" gal c tic os \" who could only have been included in those squads as one of the \" foreign \" players . : note that the only player whose \" homegrown \" status i 'm currently unsure about is shay given . he spent his more youthful years playing at celtic ( which , with scotland being as much part of britain as wales , is not intuitively recognized as being a foreign club for the purposes of interpreting this provision ) and was transferred to blackburn rovers in the summer pre season of ( when exactly i can not determine ) only a few months after his th birthday in april . he then played for ( and so was registered with ) blackburn for the next three seasons before moving on to newcastle united . summer of until end of season ( may ) in does not quite give him months of registered performance with blackburn rovers , but as i now understand the provision , he still qualifies because he played ( was registered for ) \" three full seasons \" . thus he is marginal and might well not qualify as a \" homegrown \" player . i would like to hear your views on what you feel his true status is . step - a \" squad status \" code applied to each current manchester city first team player squad status classification legend : u - under player : a player that meets the uefa epl under player provision ( for current season ) acg - academy grad player : a player that meets the uefa homegrown academy player provision ( for any season ) hgp - homegrown player : a player that meets the uefa epl homegrown player provision ( for any season ) for -

when his new status will be \" acg \" ) . a strawman for what my proposed changes to the pst will look like is shown in [ external link : this sandbox ] courtesy of gonads . this represents a a slightly further refining of the above ideas by he and myself . specific features to note are : ( ) the change of section name to \" playing statistics table \" ( i believe you have effectively already embraced this suggested change ) ; : ( ) the addition of the legend table that defines the new column of squad status codes ; : ( ) based on the friendly game against bor ussia dor t mund i assigned squad number to kolarov and flagged it as \" citation needed \" ( mostly to illustrate by example how i feel these sort of updates should be done , and can be done , without making the table format a complete mess ; because of the footnoted asterisk at the bottom of the table , each uncited table field requiring future citation going forward merely has to be indicated with an asterisk superscript in that field ) ; : ( ) the addition of the footnoted general citations ( i . e . , they apply to the pst as a whole ) for both the mcfc web site article announcing the new squad numbers for the upcoming season ( note : this citation is already in place in the current version of the article ) and the mcfc web site page that lists the current players in the mcfc first team squad . in the analysis above i appended digits to the squad code t las simply in order to make the number of players in each pool of players immediately apparent . thus it becomes immediately obvious that mancini really only has players currently competing as serious contenders for the places in both of the epl and uefa squads . i did not assign digits to some of the listed squad names because imo these players are only de facto members of the first team squad ( because , as you argued in the \" gun nar nielsen \" section they are now too old to officially play for the eds ) and most people would not regard them as being serious contenders for a place in either of the two - man squads , as well as ( possibly ) not even seriously competing for use in the resultant \" domestic cup pool \" that will ultimately consist of any of the above players that fail to make the two - man squads in addition to all the players that do make it into those squads . i hope you found the foregoing interesting and useful and i look forward to hearing your feedback in the sections that follow . i may not have pc access for the next few days so you do n't have to break your neck to get back to me with that feedback , and that also gives you some time to ponder all of the above material . otoh , a quick acknowledgment that you 've read the material and are not instantly dismissive of it would be nice . ) : discussion of the proposed changes to the pst i 'm largely in favour of this , though i want to raise one point : do we actually know how often a squad can reissue it 's - man selection ? because if it 's at any time more frequently than the end of each transfer window , i 'd venture that it could prove problematic resolving how you classify a player who was included in the - man once , then was removed for a month , then was put back in , or something like that . also , while the club is waiting to sell players and has more players than the - man rule allows ( even accepting that u - s are n't counted ) how do you propose to represent the - man squad when we do n't know exactly who wo n't be included . and do we yet know what ruling the pl is using over who counts as an under - ? as i 've mentioned somewhere before , the pl has previously tended to be quite inclusive , leading to some cases of - year olds playing for under - sides for the countries and such . : i do not have the time to google a citable source for you , but i 'm pretty ( ) certain that both the epl and uefa squad registration deadlines are synchronized to the end of the summer and january transfer windows for the reasons i explained in my final paragraph of my original post ( in the \" going forward \" section below ) . with some minor differences those two transfer windows apply across almost all the uefa nations , all of which play a fall - winter - spring season , although as we keep hearing re england 's disappointing performance in the world cup last month , england ( and probably scotland too ? ) is one of the few countries that actively continues playing through its winter transfer window . i most definitely know that the deadline for the initial registering of all the epl squads for the upcoming season is august , which is indeed the same as the end of the summer transfer window . thus a club can sign its new star striker on the final day of the transfer window ( and how often have you seen that happen ? does the name robin ho ring any bells ? ) and register him to play in the epl that same day . so the short answer is , \" yes , it 's only twice a year ( citation needed ) \" ! : the example you describe of a player being initially registered in an epl squad , and then removed from it for a month , and then put back in again , etc . would indeed be a problem . it would also be an administrative nightmare ! which is why it does n't work that way . wrt \" how do you propose to represent the - man squad when we do n't know exactly who wo n't be included ? \" the answer is : exactly like [ external link : this ] . imo , this sandbox version of the current \" squad table \" section that gonads and i worked on ( before you came online today ) is ready to go ( meaning it could be used to overwrite the existing \" squad table \" section right now ) . as i explained in the first paragraph of the \" updating the pst \" section above , all this first update does is essentially co dify the current first team squad players into four separate pools . : there is nothing speculative or particularly contentious in adding this new column in the way that it has been set up in the sandbox . the co di fication in the new column merely represents the effective conjunction of two pieces of individually citable information that already exists for every player currently listed in your own created \" squad table \" - viz . , his current age and his junior playing ( club registration ) history prior to age . an interpretation of both the uefa and epl player registration provisions ( also externally citable , but i paraphrased them for you in steps a and b above ) is then applied to those two pieces of citable fact in order to arrive at a resultant classification for each player that is then codified with a tla . : apropos your \" the pl has previously tended to be quite inclusive , leading to some cases of - year olds playing for under - sides for the countries and such \" i quite agree . and the reason for your observation is fully explained by the \" under player provision \" i paraphrased for you in \" step a \" above . read it again very , very carefully and note well that determining january threshold . thus a young player that turned years of age this past january is considered to be \" under \" wrt the upcoming season , and he will be years and months old when it ter min ates in may . i hope that adequately addressed all your raised concerns . : i 'll give you a longer reply later but sufficed to say this : uefa has several reconfirmation periods for squads . there 's after january yes , but you also have to confirm your squad at the end of each \" tier \" of competition . by that i mean qualifying rounds , then the play - off round , then the group stages , then the knock - out rounds , and there might even be a chance to change your squad before the final too . it 's not just when there 's a transfer window that uefa make you re confirm your squad . i doubt the pl will match date for date the confirmation periods and i also doubt they will only have two , but i 'm not sure . : i hear you . when i stated above i was pretty certain that was more aimed at the epl process . i 'm pretty certain ( based on a lot of stuff i 've read , but little of it official ) that the epl registration process is only a two - step affair - once at the end of august and then again at the end of january . but even then i 'm not certain how radically within the same season these two squads can differ - viz . , can mancini register a completely different - man squad in january than he does in august ? not that even city can afford to have that many good players ( ) simply sitting around t wi ddling their thumbs until then ! i 'm assuming that \" tweaks \" of a few player sw aps ( viz . or ) are allowed to the august - man squad in the january registration of the - man squad ( in fact , i believe it is actually called a \" re - registration \" , implying the new squad for the second half of the season can not differ by too big a factor ) . also , i 'm similarly not clear on who mancini can play in august before he has to initially register his epl squad . can he play any of his players during the first two weeks of the season , or does he have to register on august any players that have already played in epl games ? : other stuff i have read had led me to believe that the epl process was essentially modeled on the uefa squad registration process that was already in place . since city were not pushing the squad limits when they played in the uefa cup two seasons ago i really did not pay much attention to this issue then , and ditto last season when the team was not competing in europe . so i am hardly a subject matter expert on the uefa squad registration requirements . here is [ external link : something ] that supports my take on the uefa situation . hardly an official text i know ( and only the first couple of posts are worth reading ) . but those posts do suggest that your understanding that the squads can or must be re - registered before every tier of the two uefa competitions is anomalous . i 'm not by any means saying you are wrong . i offer this only as gri st for the mill of this discussion . : of course , none of the above has any ramifications whatsoever on the initial co dif ying of the players in city 's first team squad into four pools of player eligibility ( which i believe to be information that is much more pertinent to any given player 's ability to clock up statistics in the upcoming season than , for instance , displaying the flag of that player 's nationality ) . the issue of squad registration frequency only affects whether it would be wise to try and go beyond my basic classification of the players into pools , and further indicate in the pst the actual named squads once they have both been submitted , or whether doing so would only be an open invitation to edit warring due to how often the makeup of these squads changed during the course of the season . even only changing twice ( every august and january ) might still be too frequent from that perspective . : i 've spent quite some time since my last post above trying to find the official text of the squad registration requirements on the official web sites of both uefa and the premier league with absolutely no luck . one would think both of those sites would have a section dedicated to it prominently displayed . or at least a faq section dedicated to the topic . and they may well do , but i 've not been able to locate it yet on either site . after i came across that manchester united message board web page and the comment there that was quoting text from uefa . com site i similarly spent quite a bit of time trying to locate a source version of that text , also with no luck . which is why i posted the link to the united mb discussion because it is still the best coverage of this topic that i could come up with . however , i 'm not at all happy with it because it is not a primary source and technically it is merely hearsay ( which , of course , is how most people are learning about the ramifications of the new ruling ) . it was only because that one poster seemed to be quoting the official text of the ruling from the uefa . com web site that i used it above . i 'll still keep looking for a better source of information . it mt , if you know of a link to the source text of either of the epl and uefa squad registration rulings please post them here so that we can base any discussion of this issue going forward on the actual rulings rather than on gossipy ( mis - ) interpretations of them . thanks . : btw , i am assuming that the same uefa squad registration requirements apply to all three of its competitions and that there is not a separate one for each of the champions league , the europa league and the super cup ! please lord , let that be the case ! ( out of respect for this user 's talk page i shall be concluding my discussions on this subject here . i look forward to discussing it elsewhere , if given the opportunity . the pst squad status information going forward finally , let me address the issue of what you might wish to do once mancini registers his - man squads with both the epl ( at the end of this month for the first half of the upcoming season ) and uefa ( i 'm not quite sure when exactly the europa league registration deadline is , but i 'm assuming it is probably the same date ) . if my understanding of the two squad registration requirements is correct ( step ) , and my understanding of the various players ' ages and youth backgrounds is also correct ( step ) , and my application of the two sets of requirements to all the players currently listed in the latest version of the pst ( step ) is also correct , then the above status codes are actually quite objective pieces of information ( i wo n't go so far as to say \" un contentious \" because as we all saw with my recent go - around with gonads , there are times and situations where even the information he is now defending from change was , only a few days ago , quite contentious ) . my assigned squad stat i merely classifies all the current first team squad players into four useful pools , and it does not try to second guess mancini 's ultimate - man \" epl squad \" and - man \" uefa squad \" selections ( should they differ ) . however , after both those - man squads are announced you could possibly then modify the above stat i to suitably reflect which competitions the various players are eligible to participate in ( which is the whole pur po ose of this classification process ) . how that is best done is a topic of discussion for another day . because the wisdom of going beyond what i 've already done in \" step \" above is something that needs some careful thought . if you did decide to go in that direction , the \" squad status \" information would change twice per season since the both squads have to be registered at the end of every transfer window ( thus allowing newly acquired and lo aned - in players to be added , and newly sold and lo aned - out players to be removed from the prior registration ) which would create a similar situation as exists for the new squad numbers every pre season . and that might create simply way too much editing contention\n",

      "ap tured by the [ wiki link : fbi ] on [ wiki link : january ] [ wiki link : ] one point of agreement that i 've seen in the discussions about fair use is that it would be beneficial for us to mark fair use images as such . because of numerous technical reasons , the best way to accomplish this will be to modify the image and append the notice to the image itself . i 've prepared the infrastructure to do so and could have all of our images done in a matter of days if we wanted to move at that pace . my currently proposed notice is at [ wiki link : image : not free . svg ] , feel free to suggest changes . barring any launch problems , i plan to start doing this on wednesday in a low speed manually operated manner . : maybe this is obvious , but . is n't that technically a derivative work , with all the legal baggage that entails ? : no , i do n't think so . these new images will be uploaded over the old ones , and adding a tag below an image is not creating a derivative image , as the original image is fully intact . this is simply adding more metadata to a lower part of the image that did n't exist before ( if that makes any sense ) . : i suggested a similar thing early on in my involvement here . i like it and i think g maxwell 's method avoids the \" derivative \" problem by placing the watermark outside of the actual image , at the lower border . certainly a single image file can be governed by one part copyright and one part gfdl , just as our wikipedia pages can be considered ag gre gates ) . nice idea , but i think there is a better way to do this . we determine ourselves where images come from ( wikipedia 's database ) , and we also control the language with which they are added into wikipedia pages . why not make this a dynamic part of the inclusion ? we could automatically add such a marker , and we could even make it link to the copyright statement in the database . it will take the programmers some time i guess , but i think it 's possible , and it might be better in the long run . ( changing pictures is something we can always do , un changing them will be harder ) . [ wiki link : wp : tv wikiproject television ] ) : performing it in the image tag is not a good idea because rather than dealing with several hundred thousands images which change very infrequently , we 'd be dealing with n times that number of image inclusions . performing it in the image tag would also require adding an additional key to the thumbnail name , which would just be messy . doing it fully in mediawiki for the entire image was considered of course , but it would basically work the same way on the back end . i 'm already effectively using mediawiki for this . the biggest challenge there is that identifying fair use images from the wikitext is actually somewhat hard because there are many dozens of tags categories that might indicate the status . and it 's a moving target . oh , and yes . jeff ness above has it : the reason that the mark is under the image rather than on the image is in part to avoid concerns about creating a derived work ( also to avoid problems with placement , and poor contrast ) . i 've loved this idea ever since i saw the example above with patrick stewart , but i keep forgetting to comment about it . although i think it would be far more efficient and effective to something like dj suggests , something with software , or even a template . : are you offering to code it ? i think g maxwell 's is a great idea and may also have the incidental effect of prompting people to go out and get more free images to replace fair use images . but can you make a better - looking \" not free \" footer for it ? it dis pleases my eyes . a space would be a good start , and a font more like gill sans would be good . and not all caps , either . - : yes . thats sounds great . if someone else does n't do it first , i 'll make those changes ( and whatever else is suggested . : i think the text can be pretty small and even in a medium gray - the extra block of white is going to be plenty attention - getting . another possibility is to position at the top , and centered . what happens to images tagged as fair use that are actually pd ? does n't happen often , but i 've fixed a few . : i like the idea of putting it top - and - center . of course , i also like the idea of making it red and blinking , so my judgement may be a little suspect here - ) perhaps it 's time to attribute authorship and copyright in the article for all images , instead on an image summary page that you have to click on ? that blank field with \" not free \" seems to be a perfect place for a copyright notice . this seems the right time to ask . i would suggest an exception for free images used as icons , but as the debate on [ wiki link : template : click ] has shown , people do n't like clickable icons either . : two thoughts : people may begin tagging images with incorrect free tags if they discover their fair use images are being modified ( this happens here and at commons when someone tags an image with a non compatible license that automatically tags the image for speedy deletion , and then they change it to ) . also , maybe you could resize the image downwards ? we do n't need x fair use images - ) : too spammy . we provide attribution in a manner which is consistent with text and universal to all mediawiki in stal ls . putting names more prominently will produce too much bad incentive : when someone wants in image on the article we 'll never know if it is because they think the image is good or if it 's because they want their \" name in lights \" , a lot of opportunity for bad blood . finally , it is feature creep . lets solve one problem at a time . as far as multi - tagging goes , not only do i keep track of which images are tagged , i can detect the tagging in the image , and move it aside for human inspection . hopefully this is a stupid question , but what are you doing to avoid hitting the same image more than once ? adding row after row of tags would not be good . secondly , i think agreeing to do this should include discussion in a wider forum than this one . otherwise it would be difficult to respond to outsiders who think such tags look ugly and simply revert them . : ps . i would be one of those people tempted to revert . such a tag only makes the images ug lier for our primary audience , readers . it probably does little to help our secondary audience , re users , since large scale re users would have no way of processing those tags , and small scale re users would often look at the image description page anyway to get the big version of the image . i will admit that it might encourage people to submit free replacements , but tagging all fair use images in de sc ri min ately would add an ugly footer to various logos , album covers , and other things where equivalent replacement is impossible . and after all , theoretically we want the only fair use on wikipedia to be the ir re pl ac able kind , right ? so if someone did add \" not free \" to an image i uploaded when i felt there was no expectation that it could be replaced with a free alternative , i probably would be tempted to revert . : well we coo rect misunderstandings all the time . there is also an aspect of truth in advertising to this : we claim to be the free encyclopedia on every page , . it makes sense if were going to have non - free things that we should identify them clearly . : yes , that 's a good point ; there 's a kind of transparency to this that i had n't considered . i like this suggestion ( although i 'm sure that we can tweak the tag itself ) . one advantage that all readers of this page should appreciate : if this feature is implemented , in a few months we should have a definitive answer to the question of whether deletion of replaceable free - use images is the only , or best , way to trigger replacement . i would actually advocate for the copyright image being made slightly more ob trusive or ugly red , perhaps ? alternatively , the copyright notice image could be part of a template which , when clicked upon , could lead the reader to a paragraph explaining our image policy and why free images are preferred , and inviting the reader to replace the image with a free equivalent if possible . this is only being considered for possibly re pl ac able fair use images , right ; like those on living persons ? e . g . it 's possible that somebody might photograph osama bin laden and gdfl the image while we still lack confirmation of his demise . it will most likely not be implemented for years if ever , but i have posted a enhancement request at [ wiki link : bugzilla : ] that i think would be very handy for this if it was ever implemented ( feel free to vote for it , not sure how they pick items to work on ) . basic aly the idea is to add a new magic word than when added to a image page ( usu aly via a template , such as a copyright tag , or a deletion template ) allow for an arbitrary class parameter to be attached to the image in all articles that use it . this would allow us to write a style sheet rule in the global style she ed to define for example how all \" fairuse \" classed iam ges should be presented in articles . throw javascript into the mix and you can append text to the caption , super impose a warning on top of the image itself and all sorts of stuff like that . would have been a very handy feature . may be a pain to implement though , so i guess it 's not a short term solution . : certainly , a proposal to re - brand every copyrighted image on wikipedia deserves wider exposure than this page af for ds ; that 's why i 've cross - posted it to the village pump . [ wiki link : wikipedia : village pump policy it . s time to tag . ] , for those who are interested in what other , non - fair - use - obsessed wikipedians might think of this plan . ex if ( and other computer read ables ) i think it would be a good idea to make the copyright info on all images and multimedia digitally readable as well . this would allow for rapid software based han de ling . i 'm paging through the ex if specs and have n't found custom tags yet , but perhaps we could somehow di ddle the ex if tags to include this kind of info as well ? for svg perhaps we could introduce an object or tag in the same way . that leaves png . for bitmap based images , we might instead di ddle the top left or bottom right corner , or some such . for other multi - media , like music , there 's an id or what have you . from the village pump : unless i have misinterpreted your plans , i strongly advise not doing this until consensus is made . and i do n't just mean an informal consensus in this space , but rather in a higher arena of discussion . mainly , i have some concerns that altering existing images will compromise image resolution . also , will your infrastructure work across different file types ( jpg , png , . ) ? ( [ wiki link : special : emailuser twas now e - mail ] ) : certainly seeking consensus is the reason it 's been posted to vp . ) , but it helps to bring it up again because it is very important . this is a large and important change and it 's important to have wide knowledge of it . : would this plan apply to [ wiki link : category : copy ri gh t by wikimedia ] ? : definitely , yes . for example , [ wiki link : screenshot ] used to have a screenshot of wikipedia displayed in firefox . firefox is free , but since wikipedia is non - free , the image was replaced with a screenshot of a totally free nature . ( i happen to oppose this tagging idea on anything but those images that are possibly re pl ac able but are used under a credible free use claim . those images used under an incredible fair use claim should be deleted . those images that are fair - use and not re pl ac e al be should never be tagged in article view , except as an optional feature for those users that want it . ) : i actually like the idea of displaying the notice across all non - freely licensed images . i 'd suggest \" not freely licensed , \" however , because \" not free \" is too ambiguous and really makes no sense out of context . : however , i 'm rather shocked that the \" best way \" to apply the tag is actually to modify every image itself ; i 'm opposed if that 's how it is to be implemented . would n't that double the server space fair use images take up , as a new image version will be uploaded with the tag on top of the original without ? and it will necessarily always be playing catch - up to new images . the only proper solution would automatically and immediately display the notice in articles across any images that are not tagged under a free license , without actually having to modify the image file itself\n",

( this is the most - polled population in the middle - east . ) if you sincerely believe that this is a tri bal istic conflict , then perhaps you can sufficiently demonstrate that jews entertain similar views wrt arabs muslims islam whatever - your - contention - is . as for where to direct your dad in his search for artificial stupidity , the article is not the place to point him , although this talk page might be . : by means of example , here 's a news story from april , : according to a poll taken by the prestigious da ha f institute , headed by veteran israeli poll ster mina tz em ach , an overwhelming majority of israelis believe that the state should encourage arab citizens of israel to emi grate . : the poll taken for mad ar , the palestinian center for israeli studies , located in ram allah , found that of jewish israelis surveyed , agreed that the state should be encouraging arabs to emi grate . an additional said they tended to agree with this . : forty percent of those surveyed said they disagreed or tended to disagree with having the state promote the emigration of arabs . : this is a far cry from advocating the killing of the arabs , or even of demonizing arabs in any way , but this is the kind of thing that you might be able to use to build up your case for what you appear to be claiming . that said , a lot of what you 're going to find and compile will most likely end up being original research . do you honestly believe that arabs are not overwhelmingly demon ized in israeli \" culture \" ? do you know what they teach in their textbooks ? they teach that palestine was an empty desert , sparsely inhabited by savage arab nomads before the white european jews \" returned \" in the th century and \" turned the desert green \" . historical context i think it would also be valuable to hist or ici ze this discussion ( as the article on christian anti - semitism is ) . i was taught that muslim spain was a great time place for jews quite different from the situation today . i wonder how much arab anti - semitism was aroused or even created by the rise of modern nationalism ( both arab nationalism and zionism ) ? in any event , i think the aticle would be stronger if it could document changing arab attitudes , as well as differences between official and popular attitudes towards jews , and the changing contexts for these activities , sr as sr had pointed out , the terms \" arab \" and \" muslim \" are not interchangeably . many arabs are christians ( maybe , , more ? ) , a tiny percent are of the druze faith ( though they rarely refer to themselves as arabs ) . in the western world a small number of arabs are likely uni tarians , deists , humanists and atheists . similarly , a large number of muslims are not arab . perhaps the current title of the entry should be re - titled \" islamic anti - semitism \" ? i will not change the name of the entry today , to see if any other useful name suggestions come up . : \" of the druze faith ( though they rarely refer to themselves as arabs ) \" that 's simply not true . i 'm not aware of any significant element of the lebanese or syrian druze populations who do n't think of themselves as arabs . this is the first time i 've edited a talk page - sorry if i mess it up . i totally agree with the above comments , the article is n't on arabs and anti - semitism , it 's on arabs and anti - semitism in the th century . there is a long history of ( generally ) peaceful relations between the two , it 's a shame to focus purely on recent history . i must agree , we need more material on anti - arabism as well . also , we need some data on the part about how prior to the last century or so , muslims generally treated jews better th n just about everybody else the contrast with modern events is staggering . this article is silly . what if i were to create an article \" whites and anti - black racism \" , or \" the chinese and anti - japanese racism . \" this article is not relevant information , but a political opinion supported by facts . yes , there arabs that are anti - semitic . but writing an article characterizing all or even a majority of arabs as anti - semitic is racist . this article is an advertisement for someone 's political opinion , therefore should not constitute as an article for an encyclopedia . i 'd support renaming the article , revising it , or outright removing it . emotionally driven and slightly off - topic , but you do have a point . given that racism is not a monolithic concept , it stands perfectly to reason that individual subjects of racism should be discussed individually . islam and conquering i have completely no expertise in this area , but this passage struck me as odd : unlike christianity , muslims sought to conquer the world through force of arms , rather than through conversion . as such , when muslim armies conquered nations , they felt no special need to force jews ( or christians ) to convert to islam . members of other religions , however , were forced to convert , or they were killed . there was never a christian program to conquer the world . there is one in islam , but if memory serves the original idea in the koran was more like conversion than anything else ; certainly \" world conquering \" is a lousy description for the idea . : right , i was trying to show a contrast between christianity and islam . christianity never officially sent armies over the planet to convert the world to christianity . ( although individual kings and queens effectively did this ; but they did so as part of a nationalist agenda , and not a theological one . ) in contrast , the quran commands muslims to conquer the world for islam ; during mohammed 's life and in the centuries after , that is what they actually did . they succeeded in militarily conquering over a third of the known world at the time . muslim armies swept over nation after nation . only massive amount of military force from christian nations stopped the expansion of islam . to this day islamic law requires that muslims recon quer the lands that they lost ( including spain and israel . ) also , i think the claim that members of other religions were forced to convert or killed is plain wrong , so i 'm removing it . under muslim rule in india during the middle ages , \" dhimmi \" status was extended to hindus ; similarly buddhists elsewhere . jews had it better under nus li ms that under christians - well , from that article it seems that it have more or less the same rights ( auth onomy , right to pr ac tic ise its religion ) as in poland ( and i guess in few other christian countries the same ) . what were differences ? i would either remove that sentence , or add \" with exception of . and here listed few ( right now i am thinking about one b - ) ) countries \" . or what were that rights compared to jewish auth onomy in poland - lithuania ? had jews some auth onomy in hungary too ? for a detailed analysis of this subject , please see \" under crescent and cross : the jews in the middle ages \" , by mark r . cohen , princeton univ . press , . the intro to the book says \" did muslims and jews in the middle ages co habit in a peaceful \" interfaith utopia ? \" or were jews under muslim rule persecuted , much as they were in christian lands ? rejecting both pole m ically charged \" myths , \" mark cohen offers a systematic comparison of jewish life in medieval islam and christ end om the first in - depth explanation of why medieval islamic - jewish relations , though not u topic , were less confrontational and violent than those between christians and jews in the west . \" [ external link : website for this book ] title of the article why is this article titled \" arab anti - semitism \" and seems to only include information about \" islamic anti - semitism \" ? not all arabs are muslims and to suggest so would not be very npov . this does n't seem to follow the logic of the more aptly named , \" christian anti - semitism \" . i suggest a change in title to [ wiki link : islamic anti - semitism islamic anti - semitism ] : the choice of name for this article is just plain \" bad \" . even changing it to \" islamic anti - semitism \" is a bad idea . what this article deals with is a very specific manifestation of anti - sem imi tism , specifically as promoted by a ( predominantly ) sunni arab - world media and religious establishment dominated by wah ha bis or others who use wah ha bi ya to promote their agenda ( or in the case of certain governments , to help divert attention from their oli gar chist or dictatorial r gim es ) . in that light , it should be renamed \" wahhabi anti - semitism \" or included in a \" modern manifestations \" section in the already extant \" islamic anti - semitism \" article . i agree that this article is crap , not because it 's a made up phenomenon , but because it 's poorly done . should n't the \" s \" in anti - semitism be capitalized ? i thought it always was in english and my searches on google tend to support this . arab peoples speak semitic languages first of all , many arabic people are sam ites ! sam ites is a common description for the people living or lived around the palestine israel area , jews , palestinians , sam arians , phi li ste es and so on . israel has tried with bac ter i ological warfare against their enemies , they have failed because genetically speaking jews and arabs are very similar . second of all , taking quotes , from a book written about years ago , and not mentioning their historical context is stupid . third of all , the only thing this shows is a deep ignorance towards arab culture , yes keep the content rename the article to \" jewish racism against arabs \" it would fit . : is n't sam ite a type of cloth ? and if you will read other areas of the wikipedia , you will see that arabs are not being singled out there are other cases around of articles about anti - arabism . : arabs are not semites . they are a people whose langauge is semitic , which is a big difference . please see the article on [ wiki link : anti - semitism ] for a discussion of the etymology of the word . it does n't mean what you imagine it does . : ( ) there is no such thing as \" arabic people \" . arabic is a language , spoken by many peoples , most of whom are semites or relatives of semites . \" arab \" describes several of those peoples , primarily those who live on the arabian peninsula . not all arabs , however , speak arabic . your claim that \" semite \" describes peoples who live d in or around the palestine israel area is patently wrong . ancient jews were predominantly semitic , descending directly from no ach 's son shem . palestinians is a nationality that was made up in to describe the arabic - speaking residents of ( and refugees ( real or claimed ) from ) living in the levant in what is presently the nation - state of israel including the disputed territories , not - including the golan . palestinians take their name from palestine , the name the romans gave the province of i ud a following the qu ashing of the jewish revolt against rome in ad . why did they name it pal est ina ? in honor of the philistines , the ancient enemies of the jews , who had been long since conquered in succession by the jews , egyptians and assyrians . in other words , they named the province in honor of a people who no longer existed , in order to give that people a posthumous \" victory \" over the jews . ( jerusalem was at the same time renamed lia cap i to lina , but this really is not a history lesson . ) the sam arians were jewish residents of the sh om ron , who were exiled ' en masse ' by the assyrians approximately years ago . i assume , however that what you meant were the sam ari tans , who were a people brought in by the assyrians to dis place the sam arians who had been exiled km to the east . these people were ( and in hebrew , to this day , are ) called ku th im , because they came from the region of ku th , somewhere in mesopotamia . i assume this is the modern city we know as al kut in modern - day iraq . it is possible that these people were also semites . the last group , \" phi li ste es \" ( an erstwhile spelling of philistines ) is an almost laughable inclusion , since of the little that is known about them , the one thing upon which every historian agrees is that they were definitely not semites . in fact , it quite clearly says in the only text from the time that says anything about their origin , that they came from k af tor : cyprus . : ( ) the claim that israel has engaged in bac ter i ological warfare against their enemies is incomprehensible nonsense . that quote would make a good inclusion into what the article discusses . what really makes it all - the - more ridiculous is that the same people who make these claims , in other contexts , claim that jews today are not really jews , claiming instead that ash ken azim especially are descendants of khazars ( who were legitimately jewish , but by conversion . which apparently does n't mean anything to the anti - jewish pro m ul gators of this nonsense , since they cite conversion as a reason to say that someone is n't really jewish . ) , and therefore not only not jewish , but also not even semites . genetically speaking , jews ( with the exception of tem anim , ben e israel , and a few other important groups ) are overwhelmingly more closely related to arabic - and aramaic - speaking populations from syria , jordan and iraq than they are to populations from arabia or north africa . in fact , genetically speaking , the vast majority of jews , including ash ken azim , are closer to these populations than egyptian \" arabs \" are to arabian - peninsula arabs . this is a fact well known to the israelis ( of whom are \" arabs \" ) . i wo n't continue to discuss ( right now at least ) how ridiculous this assertion is , but it 'd be nice if you 'd provide a single shred of evidence to back it up when you spout such drivel . ( no , that was not meant to sound diplomatic . do n't watch for an apology . ) : ( ) i could n't agree more about the stupidity of quoting things without context from year old texts . this does not stop the same people about whom this article was written from quoting year old texts out of context . : ( ) renaming the article is a great idea , one which i fully support . renaming it \" jewish racism against arabs \" is not the answer . such a recommendation is nonsensical , and it certainly would not fit , and not only because arabs are n't a \" race \" ( indeed , no moreso than jews are ) . in any case , while i recognize that you might find the article ( or its name ) personally offensive , lashing out in this way , especially anonymously , does nothing to serve your cause . : ( ) finally , the term \" [ wiki link : anti - semitism antisemitism ] \" , no matter how it 's hyphenated or capitalized , was specifically invented by a professed hater of jews for the express purpose of meaning \" hatred of jews \" , to replace the earlier term \" juden ha \" , because he thought it sounded more scientific rather than emotional or religious . wow . what i read on this page never fails to amaze me . i just read that \" arabs are not semitic \" . i also read that \" palestinians was created in \" . let me ask you something \" t shiloh \" . do you consider yourself to be an educated person ? do you really think you have a good grip on whats going on the world right now ? i suggest hat you hit the books my friend . stop living in denial of your young military state 's history . accept certain things and move on in life . as for \" rk \" you could tell me all day that lev antine and northern penn in sul a arabs are not semitic and i would laugh at you . i 'd say that i do n't think european jews are semitic , but thats not even the point . the point it , the article needs to be named something else . as of now , i 'm not even going to complain about the content . it just needs to be renamed because arabs being anti - semitic is oxy moronic . you people have shown me a new level of ignorance . edits and reversions ( ) rk , about your recent mass reversion - why did you do it ? i agree there are questions to be asked about several of the changes , but many of the changes were putting the qur ' an verses in better context ( how can that be less npov ? ) and ( the editor claimed ) correcting the quotes from the qur ' an - can you explain why you reverted these changes as well as all the others ? : nov , ( utc ) : there was no effort at all to represent the situation in a historical light , nor any attempt at all to do anything less than present a full - fledged islamic apologetic . the person made very clear , in a number of places , that islam really was the one true religion , and every change he made reflected this viewpoint . very little of what he or she wrote was npov . it would be a huge waste of time to through every single change one sentence at a time . if someone wants to make a good faith effort in adding to or improving this entry , they need to at least try to be npov . my user - history shows that i am perfectly willing to do the same kind of revert with regards to articles on other faiths ; in recent months i ( among others ) have done precisely the same thing when presented with orthodox jewish apo lo ge tical rewrites of articles , or jehovah witness christian apo lo ge tical rewrites of articles . it does n't matter if the person is a member of my faith or not . even when changes are made that make my preferred faith out to be \" the one truth \" i have removed such claims , simply because i am trying ( the best i can ) to be npov . : i understand that my actions make it look like i am unwilling to accept any changes , but that is not so . we can look through the history of this article , and at our leisure incorporate one change at a time , as long as there some historical scholarship to back it up , or as long as opinions are presented as such . i just would hope that when new changes are made , they do n't concern every single paragraph at the same time , and that when changes of major importance are made ( as they were ) there is something offered in the talk section to back some of them up . personal comment as a muslim i 've always been told to respect all humans and never go against a jew or christian since they are also followers of the same god . i 'd have to definetely say this is fabricated material written by a ignorant individual , and should not be featured as one of the pages in this site . prophet mohammad always tells us to love and respect those of other faiths who worship the same god . these quotes are ridiculous fabrications written by misguided people . the quran has never been interpreted as such or translated in such a manner . quran verses have always been written in a beautiful poetic manner . : dear mr . anonymous : you may find this page insulting or un complimentary to the prophet , pbuh . that fact however , does not negate the fact that the material presented in this article is an accurate portrayal of the daily pronouncements coming from the media and ( especially alla wi te and wahhabi ) religious establishment both in the modern arab world and in those enc la ves of the rest of the world where their influence is felt . i have already registered my distaste with the name of the article as a whole , but the fact remains that the phenomenon exists , and to a much greater extent than many people , especially muslims living in \" the west \" are comfortable admitting . i have shown examples of the subject matter of this article to muslim friends of mine , and their in v ari able instant reaction is \" that 's not islam ! \" while i 'm happy to hear that \" that 's not islam \" , their voices are not heard , or if they are , have no impact on the vehemently anti - israel , and anti - jewish rhetoric that is now commonplace on \" the arab street \" . this is unfortunate , but denying it does n't make it go away , nor does an unwillingness to admit to its existence or per v asi veness make it misguided fabrication . change of title i changed the title of the article . the title is undoubtedly neutral now , whether or not it was before . some suggestions for completing the article would be : * charges of anti - semitism , i . e . , claims by jews and others that some arabs are , do , or say anti - semitic things . * koran statements * newspaper statements * response si 'm not taking sides , and i 'm not going to write this . you guys are : rk , eli an , dan kes het , et al . while i sit back and watch . : sorry , i do n't have the knowledge for writing about arab anti - semitism , all i know is that [ wiki link : memri ] is not the place to do research about it ( and maybe also not the appropriate site to link to ) . did someone just change the article back ? i 'm getting dizzy . maybe i should just log off for the weekend . wh e e ! time off from wikipedia ! : yes , me ( explanation on my talk page ) , so it 's not you getting dizzy ; - ) have a nice weekend ! having followed the edit history of this article and reread it , i do n't think i will change any jota of this article . if people want to use wikipedia as a propaganda platform for slandering arabs , i do n't want to stop them , lost in their hatred as they seem . need for critical analysis i find the changes i made reasonable , i think the article sounds a bit more neutral now . : the quotation from the qur ' an ? not really , sorry . what this article is missing is a thorough analysis of the development of anti - semitism ( how much effect had the creation of israel ? ) , a critical debate of how much is anti - israeli sm and how and if the terms are se per able , a description of the practical in sti tu tionalization of anti - semitism ( are there any laws in the arab countries which discriminate against jews , i . e . especially jews , not just adherents of other religions ? ) . a mere collection of anti - semitic statements of arab j oun alists and politicians does not make it an encyclopedia entry . and this is something i ca n't do , because i do n't have the knowledge . i do n't want to use ad hominem arguments , but ideally all this should not be written by a jew , who lacks the necessary distance to discriminate between anti - israeli sm and anti - semitism ( this is not directed to jews in general ) . muslims hate jews . fuck the quran and fuck mo ha mad . the quotations written before i excluded them from the original article seemed in explicit , by re pl ac eing it with a more accurate verse i wanted to show that anti - semitism is a inaccurate interpretation of the qur ' an . the original , inaccurate verses written in the current article led up to these misinterpretations by which the author tried to prove his point . however you certainly seem to make a point . should we exclude the quotation ? responding both to eli an and to ali reza hash emi : everything relating to jews in the middle east is so tangled up that even when people are ear ne stly looking for common ground they often can not find it . there is too much hostility , both open and disguised . there arguments for against so many large and small points , and many of these are in tri c ately inter - related , too . we ca n't even agree on what a \" [ wiki link : palestinian ] \" is , or whether a [ wiki link : palestinian state ] exists ! these latter two difficulties alone make it just about impossible to write any neutral articles , even when a writer is determined not to take sides . i do n't know how to achieve [ wiki link : npov ] in this article . i just know that it 's good to try , and that i will keep trying . please help me , everyone . : hello ali reza , nice that you adopted a user name , it is a lot easier to communicate . now i understand - ) in fact , i split the article in two and moved everything about islam to [ wiki link : anti - semitism in islam ] since : first ) not all arabs are muslims and second ) not all muslims are arabs . i would suggest to exclude the quotation . if you like , have a look at the article on [ wiki link : anti - semitism in islam ] and try to neutralize it ( i inserted some quotes of ibn his ham , but there is a lot more to be done ) . be careful and prepare for edit wars , though ! i 've attempted to create something that addresses why anti - semitism in the arab newspapers . i 've attached it as a link instead of putting it in the article . what is really needed are for people from arab countries to write this . ' please ' specify for the sake of npov . it 's absolutely trivial to claim that there anti - semitic newspapers ( a lot of countries do ) , and specify which newspapers , what governments , etc . i 've tried to do begin this in the article , but i implore you to add more . removed nonsense i removed \" thanks to the efforts of american pro - israeli organizations , the world is kept well informed about what this tiny minor ty thinks . their views should correctly be compared to the hate mongering of religious extremist settlers in the west bank , gaza and in other places . \" i have no thanks to write or say . a lot of not - american and not pro - israeli peoples and organisations are vigilant about anti - semitism , as they are for any other form of racism . : feb , ( utc ) rk i reverted the previous edit by qu asar . but why do you revert this one ? what is anti - semitic . : feb , ( utc ) anti - semitism versus threats to kill israeli jews some of the examples on the page can be reasonably be classified as anti - semitism , but some can not . the long section about children on palestinian tv does n't contain anything that should be here . it is just the normal propaganda bullshit that occurs in most societies that are at war . so the palestinians hold as heros people who did violence to their enemies in the past ; so what is new ? israel does that too ( including people who were terrorists by all reasonable definitions ) . all countries do that . what we are seeing here is just the standard propaganda device of demon ising the enemy so that their legitimate concerns do n't need to be listened to . the sentence i just wrote applies both to the palestinian tv segments reported here and to the person who thought they belong on this page . zero : agreed , that section should be removed . not only for the reasons you point out , but also because they would appear to be an att act on the state of israel - not jews in general . agreed too . many palestinians wi ew the israelis as an illegitimate occupying power and terror attacks as a legitimate way to drive them out , yet that does not imply any notion that they are necessarily against jews per se . : , sep ( utc ) i strenuously disagree with ste w aci de and david mon ni aux . their claims are divorced from reality . the uncontested fact is that in the arab middle east , the terms \" israeli \" , \" zionist \" and \" jew \" are used interchangeably , indicating a con joining of anti - zionism and anti - semitism . the vast majority of arabs make no difference between opposing judaism and opposing the israeli government . since the founding of the state of israel in , arabs have interchangeably used the term \" zionists \" ( sa hy ni yy n ) , with \" jews \" , \" children of israel \" ( ban is r l ) or \" israelis \" . ( stillman , ) \" the mounting scale and sheer extent of this vehemently anti - semitic literature and commentary in the newspapers , journals , magazines , radio , television , and in the everyday life of the middle east have swamped that minority of arabs who did try to separate their attitudes to jews from their rejection of zionism . \" ( wi stri ch , antisemitism , p . ) : , sep ( utc ) even assuming the truth of everything you wrote , your logic is broken . just because someone does not verbally distinguish \" jew \" and \" israeli \" that does not mean that an attack they make on israel is actually an attack on jews . the four paragraphs in question do not even contain the words \" jew \" or \" israeli \" in palestinian quotation . what we have in those paragraphs is an account of palestinians ra iling against the people they see as their op pres sors . i do n't see the slightest anti - se mis tism in it and i do n't think it belongs in this article . : , sep ( utc ) : if you do n't see this palestinian incitement to murder jews as anti - semitic , then you are blind and self - deceiving , at best . suffice it to say that all mainstream jewish groups clearly recognize this as anti - semitism . : , sep ( utc ) : pardon me for thinking for myself , i tell things as i see them and do n't look to other people for my opinions . apparently for you any anti pathy towards people who happen to be jews is antisemitism , but for me the jewishness has to be a root cause of the anti pathy . the fact is that palestinians would want to kill eskimos if the eskimos treated them as zionism and israel have . it has nothing to do with the jewishness of the israelis . the position you espouse is simply a convenient way to avoid engaging the real issues . they are evil so their cause has no merits . furthermore , in your paragraph above , as in many things you have written in wikipedia , you make no attempt to distinguish between the palestinians ( the subject of the paragraphs in question ) and \" the arab middle east \" ( the subject of your quotations ) . that is exactly the same sin you are accusing others of . : , sep ( utc ) : what zero said makes perfect sense , and is n't bigoted in the least . if you ca n't comprehend the difference between someone hate ing israel and hating jews ( the topic of this article ) then just go away . : for example , the palestinian authority inciting their citizens to kill jews from israel is completely different from the pa inciting their citizens to kill any jew worldwide . the first is likely modi v ated by their understandable hatred of israel and the occupation . the second , if it can be shown , would infact be an example of anti - semitism as defined here . : , sep ( utc ) absolutely false . the plo does kill random jews worldwide . they have never restricted themselves to israeli soldiers , or even to random israeli civilians . ( for that matter , they also have machine gunned jewish babies int their c ri bs in recent years . this made newspapers in the west ; did you miss all those stories > this by you is political and not anti - semitic ? what nonsense . in any case , the pa and plo often makes no distinction between \" the jews \" and the \" the zionists \" . unless you are accusing them of lying about their own beliefs in their own newspapers , pa fun ed mosques , and radio stations , you have nothing to back your position up with . their own words and actions are clear , and it is intellectually dishonest to twist them around to make them into something quite the opposite . : , sep ( utc ) when was the last time a mainstream branch plo killed random jews worldwide outside israel ? when was the last time there was a serious act of terrorism worldwide which a mainstream group of the plo claimed to have carried out ? the world and the plo have changed since the s . the plo does not gun down babies in the c ri b . maybe an extremist group did it , but that does not represent the plo . i see this section has descended into a shouting match between the mo der ates and hard line pro - israelis . this place is not the place for such biased ' facts ' and pursuing your political agenda rk . questions about fairness of the article hi , i do n't think this is a completely fair and accurate description of anti - jewish sentiment in the arab world ( which i take is the topic ) . even though the article starts by warning against frequent confusion between anti - semitism and anti - zionism , it soon loses itself in that very confusion . i do n't deny the existence of anti - jewish sentiment in the world and in particular in the arab world , but i think the facts highlighted here , notably in the section about the pa , demonstrate more anti - zionist lines of thought than anti - semitism . i spent a summer in palestine , and it 's true that people there call israelis \" jews \" , but not in a racist intolerant sense . they have their share of racist people , like every one else , but they say \" the jews \" because that 's what they always said , before the creation of israel . habits are slow to fade , especially this one because some people still would rather not accept israel as a reality . anyway , i really think the section about the pa is mostly inappropriate and misleading if not altogether irrelevant . i do n't think the pa would be acting any differently if the israelis were christian or even buddhist for that matter . it shows an apology of violent armed struggle , and foolish propaganda , but against israel , not against jews . all this goes to under score the self identification of the jewish people with israel as one entity , which most non - jewish people in the world do n't make or at least do n't understand . gj this article is crap , and i do n't even need to look at the history to tell who wrote most of it . examples of what i mean : genuine anti - semitism is extremely prevalent in the [ wiki link : arab ] world the arab world includes three hundred million people , distributed from morocco to oman ( so say eth [ wiki link : arab world our article ] ; is this statement is based on polls conducted throughout the entire region ? or is it just a subjective opinion from someone who can probably neither read nor speak arabic ? : many arab newspapers . either deny that the [ wiki link : holocaust ] ever took place , or state that it was massively exaggerated \" how many ? ? do any systematic , quantitative studies exist ? : educated arabs and muslims do not accept such views , and like americans , they correctly saw these claims to be yet another [ wiki link : conspiracy theory ] . the pov should be obvious even if you think , as i do , that this belief is a nutty conspiracy theory . : however , a great many within the arab world viewed this terrorist act as a conspiracy to make the world hate all arabs , and therefore people perceived to be enemies of the arabs must really be to blame . how many ? there are polls to back up this statement , i assume . : this is despite the fact that an actual mossad conspiracy to carry out major terrorist attacks against the united states in the hope that arab terrorists would be blamed would be an insanely risky course of action for israel . pov by omission : we could also mention the fact that a war between the us and certain arab countries could be of immense benefit to israel but this is n't the place to debate conspiracy theories . then there 's the debate over the pa 's war propaganda ( see above ) , but i doubt that will be resolved any time soon . anyway , i 'll see what i can do for this article , but i am not san gu ine about its prospects . good points - in particular , the polls . if a statement about a population 's views ca n't be backed up numerically , it 's unlikely to belong here . i 've fixed no . already , but much remains to be done . - anti - semitism , or mis o - judaism ? \" arab anti - semitism \" is not really an accurate term since arabs are themselves semites . a more appropriate term would be \" arab mis o - judaism \" . : no . we will not play these word games . in the english language the word \" anti - semitism \" was invented to mean the h ta red of jews , and of jews alone . it has always held this meaning , and the only people who dispute this today are those who try to hide the existence of anti - semitism . further , there is no such word as \" mis o judaism \" . please see the talk archives on this specific subject in the anti - semitism article ; this issue has been talked to death a dozen times , and a firm consensus already exists on useage . : that 's fine with me i do n't really care very much either way to be honest . i was simply trying to point out that \" mis o - judaism \" might be considered more accurate in a technical , linguistic sense . please do not insinuate that by bringing up the topic i am playing \" word games \" or trying \" to hide the existence of anti - semitism \" . if the issue has already been discussed , then that 's that . it 's settled . there 's no need to be rude or to brow - beat me about it just for mentioning it . : i think it would be a good idea to note in the [ wiki link : anti - semitism ] \" etymology and usage \" the basis of the word . semitism is an article , but i do n't believe semite is ( looked , semetic people is ) . semetic does n't refer to a group of people speaking a language it refers to a group of people from the north coast of africa to iran ( i believe , that is why i 'm on a discussion page ) not trying to complain , it just seems that this needs to be sorted out by people in \" the know \" . also , it seems that you need to research to find this info , it does n't pop out at you . anti - semitism is a [ wiki link : misnomer ] , maybe putting that in the article would clear things up . : this precise issue is discussed in the article on [ wiki link : anti - semitism ] , but maybe it needs to be expanded . totally disputed please list the issues and lets address them . : see my post above , beginning with \" this article is crap \" . also see eli an 's post above , under [ wiki link : need for critical analysis ] .

[ wiki link : special : emailuser mir v ( m ) ] n atu rei kar ta i like the part about the \" ultra orthodox jews that the wider jewish community considers anti - semitic \" ! it appears that everyone , even orthodox jews , are guilty of anti - semitism . are these jews considered anti - semitic simply because they are anti - zionist ? if so , this must be one of the most glaring examples of misuse of the phrase \" anti - semitism \" for political purposes and it calls into question whether the allegations of anti - semitism made against arabs are due to the same blind spot . : exactly . it seems to me that the similar accusations that some jews are \" self - hating jew \" are often themselves anti - semitic , because they deny the jewishness of their targets . i find it really shameful how some zionists have exploited anti - semitism and the holocaust in a chauvinistic way to drum up support for their political projects . - : it 's easy to fix these problems . political speeches on talk : pages are not required to do so . pir , stop your rants against the jews ( shame fully disguised as \" the zionists \" . this kind of anti - jewish rhetoric is ( literally ) straight from the [ wiki link : je ww atch ] website , and a total violation of wikip i eda etiquette . if you want to rant against the jews , go elsewhere . this talk page is specifically for discussion of how to improve this article . : pir has a right to discuss this issue which is within the purview of improving the article . it is a legitimate question . why are jews who oppose zionism considered anti - semitic ? you have added nothing to the discussion . please stop trying to censor discussions just because it does n't appeal to your pov . : al ber uni , please stop your off - topic rants against the jews of israel . in any case , no one here claimed that a non - zionist jew must be considered an anti - semi ted . you are thus creating strawman arguments , on a topic that has nothing to do with this article . please desist . if you want to go on - and - on about the jews of israel , go elsewhere . this talk page is spe ficially for discussion of how to improve this article . restricting a talk page to the topic of the article , by definition , is not censorship . : pir 's comments were relevant to improving the article . you were just offended by them . and you still have n't addressed the question . why are jews who oppose zionism considered anti - semitic ? other side there are two articles here on [ wiki link : arab anti - semitism ] and [ wiki link : islam and anti - semitism ] . are there any article here on israeli racism against arabs and judaism negative views on gentiles ? why not ? that 's not uncommon either , and i can easily write articles on that topic . [ wiki link : israel sha hak ] actually wrote a book on it , did n't he ? : try [ wiki link : anti - arabism ] , [ wiki link : islamophobia ] , [ wiki link : zionism and racism ] : haha , [ wiki link : zionism and racism ] is a joke . when will [ wiki link : arabs and anti - semitism ] quote hamas or al - azhar or even cair in defense of the opposing proposition the way [ wiki link : zionism and racism ] quotes the adl as the authoritative source dismissing the accusation that zi o onism is racist ? what a biased encyclopedia ! : if you know the views of these organizations , please feel free to add them ; i think they 'd be worthy additions to the page . [ wiki link : special : emailuser mir v ( m ) ] ( utc ) al ber uni , i have watched your comments for over half a year now , i 've been patient , but all i have read is disgusting , propaganda and narrow minded polemic from your side , never anything constructive has come out of your mouth . you are just a jihadist , and i put ji ha di sts like you in the same catagory as neo nazis . stop trying to defame judaism , stop making anti semitic , false claims about judaism 's non existant \" negative \" views on gentiles , stop quoting discredited de fam ers and anti semites like israel sha hak , or equate islamist terrorist apologist fronts like cair to human right organizations like the adl . if you continue your politicized crusade and continue to vandalize these boards instead of offering constructive criticism instead of ide al ogical diatribes , i will make a petition to ban you from this site . i 'm not entirely sure on al ber uni 's positions , but calling cair a \" terrorist apologist front \" in that light is the pot calling the kettle black . both the adl and cair ( and while we 're at it , the arab - american anti - discrimination committee ) are fine civil rights organizations , dedicated to fighting racism against their own peoples . it 's just a shame they are n't working with each other more often . do n't criticize others ' biases without being aware of your own . drifted into the style and level of detail of original research while i agree that the article is quite problematic , it seems that much of the problem stems from the violation of the [ wiki link : original research policy against original research ] . it is the detailed but inherently uneven citing of examples that seems to drive the article toward polemic and away from a practical , neutral description of the political , religious , and racial tensions in the region . for example , imagine an article on racism in the st century in the united states referring to a set of examples like this . it would be informative , but a bit bizarre , since it would not include some of the major trends and debates that this topic should cover , such as a discussion of affirmative action , access to education , racial profiling , diversity in the workplace , etc . put another way , if you have to go to source documents to prove the trend ourselves , then we are engaged in original research . if the trend can be discussed as a force observable in many different events , then we are talking about the kind of theme that belongs in an encyclopedia . i do n't think that this trend is so obscure or difficult to discern that original research is needed . this is a case where the wrong examples weaken the case . moreover , i agree that the article fails to examine and objectively handle the problem of discerning anti - israeli and anti - semetic views . it would probably help to note that in virtually all violent conflicts where these issues arise , they become quick intertwined . look at u . s . world war ii propaganda poster images of the japanese to see some examples . not that it is ex c usable , just that it makes it difficult to distinguish these themes with precision . the article currently contains the following qualification : \" some people claim that the palestinian authority 's hostility to israel constitutes anti - semitism in itself ; others regard this claim as absurd , noting that hostility to an enemy nation need not imply hostility to the associated ethnicity . \" it seems like this should lead off the article . : you make an interesting and valid point . i do n't think the article is itself an example of original research , but it certainly appears that way , primarily bc z wikipedia is ' the cutting - edge encyclopedia . what might appear in the en y c lo p dia brittanica in a paragraph section is appearing here in a section article . i have full confidence that by , not only will this article be billion times better than the e brittanica article , but will have been pared and expanded appropriately . that 's part of what 's so great ( imho ) about this whole project . all of that to say , i do n't think it 's \" original research \" as defined in the rules , that being done by many other organizations , i just see it as being distilled seriously here into an encyclopedic article for the first time . like i said : cutting - edge . i do n't know about you , but i 'd rather be cutting - edge , with caution , than over - cautious and dull - edged . on the subject of the sentence you say you think should lead off the article , i would vote \" absolutely not \" , since that sounds more appropriate for the opinion page of the national enquirer than for any serious encyclopedia . the subject of this article , while it may involve an analysis of the pa 's media , textbooks , policies , etc . , is not p alist inian authority antisemitism . although specific mention of the fact that the pa legally forbids sale of land to jews , punishable by death , does fall within the purview of this article . it is noteworthy , in that regard , that pa law is based on an extant ( and enforced ) jordanian law that says the same thing . this is a real phenomenon , and in many ways it 's getting worse , rather than better . vfd on mar , this article was nominated for deletion . the result was keep . see [ wiki link : wikipedia : votes for deletion arabs and anti - semitism ] for a record of the discussion . request for comment i believe that the [ wiki link : vfd ] vote was not nearly long enough . are n't they supposed to be up for two weeks ? in any case there seemed to be a strong consensus to keep with a strong push to improve the article [ wiki link : npov ] and some wanting a total rewrite . i ca n't say i blame them . i have formally requested comment on this very topic and hope the totally disputed nature of this article can finally be resolved after more than a year ! : your understanding is completely baseless and without comprehension or com pre hen sibility . vfd 's require one - week terms , not two - weeks . there was no consensus , especially not \" strong \" to \" npov \" ize the article . the possibility that the article is not entirely un biassed remains as a flag , and has nothing to do with your personally instigated and promoted push to have the article deleted . your behavior with regard to this vfd , including your not having contributed to its talk page prior to your request for deletion , and your disingenuous \" compliments \" to those who voted in favor of your stated position , are indicative of a sad inability on your part to be an objective contributor to the wikipedia project . i am sorry to have to say it , but while i hold much greater leniency with respect to the posts of even demonstrably idiotic \" contributors \" to this project , if it were up to a vote to deny you further editing ability to wikipedia , and if i had a vote in such a question , i would have to , without hesitation , vote to prevent you from further sabotaging the re spe c tability of wikipedia . chill out , calm down , and learn . stop feeding your hat reds with ridiculous information . those are my words of advice , although because i disagree with you , i am sure my words of advice will fall on your fore - de af ened ears . the fact that i 'm a jew will almost certainly remove any remaining chance that you might hear my ad moni tion . i pity you , and unfortunately , i have little doubt but that my pity will be used by you as further excuse to fuel your pathetic diatribes . god have mercy on your pitiful soul , and on the day of final judgment , may you at least then finally realize how ridiculously miniscule your mind is . : i do not care if you are a jew . i do however care about whether or not you are involved with , endorse or otherwise the practice of sexual abuse to which i am a victim . this is however irrelevant to this article which is an entirely different issue : charges the arabs with [ wiki link : anti - semitism ] without considering the context in which the arab world has been effected by the mostly jewish state of [ wiki link : israel ] . and censorship is what this is all about . you were never interested in understanding my view or having a meaningful debate on the circumcision issue and therefore you extend that to mean that i ca n't have anything meaningful to say about this issue either . its silly . you remind me of those people that shout anti - semitism whenever a doctor has a meaningful finding against circumcision and yet pump the papers full of the smallest hint that circumcision may have a benefit . no wonder the public has such a skewed view on the subject . do you realize that the i have only recently discovered that i was too [ wiki link : co - dependency co - dependent ] to c ri ti ze circumcision because i was afraid it would label me as anti - semitic . as a result i am sick and unable to work despite a university degree . it is people like you that want to censor people 's ability to talk not to the point of reason , but to the point where they actually become ill . that is not acc ep tible . you have no idea if my mind is miniscule or not , you do n't know me . as for your religious views , you have no right to push them on me anymore than you have the right to deny your son his foreskin ! : when i discussed your \" understanding \" , it had nothing to do with circumcision , it had to do with rules for vfd . i 'm sorry to hear you have emotional or social problems . if we were to discuss the \" emotional trauma of childhood circumcision \" , perhaps your experience might be relevant , but we 're not , and for the purposes of the wikipedia project , we should n't be anyways , since such a discussion would fall very clearly into the realm of \" original research \" . your misinformed and misdirected diatribe against me and israel has nothing to do with the subject at hand . if you suffer the problems you say you do , i hope you can get help for them , but wikipedia is not the place for healing emotional problems . there are therapy groups for that purpose . i have no desire to push my religious views on you or anyone else , but at the same time i refuse to sit idly by while people who hold thinly veiled baseless hatred for my religious view spew their views publically . you have the right to say your piece , and i have a right to counter it . that said , however , wikipedia is not the place for airing your political or religious views , and certainly not the place to lecture me about your perceived infraction on my part of your right to hold your views , while simultaneously telling me that i have no right to hold mine . propaganda article ? i really do n't like how this article is written , and it seems heavily biased . you can at least put the warning the neutral lity of this article in its page . i know many arab people , and know they are prone to believe in conspiracy theories , but much of what they say is true , and this article does n't give an insight on the situation , nor a counterpart . it looks like a jewish propaganda article . i think this kind of topics should be specially controlled , because they should clearly who is behind wikipedia . : the article has several instances of poor writing and poor formatting , of which some of the latter i have attempted to clean up . additional work certainly is needed , but to call this a propaganda peice is outrageous . also , anyone can be \" behind \" wikipedia , so your tactic of automatically assuming a wikipedia conspiracy to promote judaism is nonsensical . arabs [ wiki link : arabs ] are a [ wiki link : semitic ] people . include that in the article somehow . : \" arabs \" are not a single people in the mind 's eye of the vast majority of people , in fact , hardly beyond those who are proponents of [ wiki link : pan - arabism ] . they are , instead , a loose collection of peoples whose native language is [ wiki link : arabic language arabic ] , not because they chose it , but because of the [ wiki link : islamic conquests islamic wars of conquest ] of the th and th centuries . arabic is certainly a [ wiki link : semitic language ] , but to say that everyone identified as \" arab \" is a [ wiki link : semite ] is intellectually , linguistically , and historically dishonest . [ wiki link : wikipedia : esperanza e ] arab view of anti - semitism i 've removed this section to the talk page because it needs to be completely rewritten . it is extremely pov , completely uncited , largely irrelevant and poorly written . for one thing , surely there is no single \" arab view of anti - semitism \" but rather many divergent opinions , yet this section is written to indicate that all arabs think alike . surely if we 're going to say what hundreds of millions of people think than we need to cite it to something ! the first paragraph needs to be much more readable , who is the \" they \" in the en ten ce \" they still indeed use thee terms interchangeably . \" for example ? the second paragraph needs to be eliminated entirely , its tone is unacceptable and the text is largely irrelevant ( what does israel being located in between africa and asia have to do with anti - semitism ? ) the sentence in the third paragraph talking about the remaining jewish communities in the arab world should be greatly expanded , but the comparison to israeli arabs and israeli jews of arab descent should be eliminated as it is irrelevant to this article and hopelessly pov . finally , i 'm not entirely sure what the fourth paragraph means and i 'd recommend it be eliminated . : arabs view anti - semitism as a historical racial discrimination against the jews and semitic - like people by the europeans . nowadays they see it as an oxymoron political term that has been extended to include the arabs as anti - semitic . although the arabs try to point to the difference between terms such as [ wiki link : israelis ] , [ wiki link : jew ] s , [ wiki link : zionists ] , and [ wiki link : semites ] , they still indeed use those terms interchangeably and inaccurately in many instances . the [ wiki link : arabs ] argue that they do not hate jews . for them the historical relationships between jews and arab rulers is a good testimony of no hate towards jews . the arabs , however fear that the [ wiki link : zionism project ] and its outcome of [ wiki link : israel ] . for them israel and the [ wiki link : zionist movement ] erected or tried to erect [ wiki link : israeli settlements settlements ] not only on what the united nations gave them in but also on the occupied territories of palestine , [ wiki link : sinai ] of egypt , [ wiki link : south lebanon ] , and [ wiki link : golan heights ] of syria . the most contentious issues are [ wiki link : jerusalem ] and the israeli borders . arabs are reportedly scared that israel would keep the occupied jerusalem and extend their borders from [ wiki link : niles ] to [ wiki link : e up hr ate ] . : they also see that israel has cut off the land links between the arab countries of north africa and those of the western asia that is the bridge at heart of the arab world . moreover the treatment of arabs both christians and muslims in israel itself is quite discriminatory with their jews c ou ter parts . even the arab jews are ill - treated in israel , they contend . they see israel policies very racist in terms of citizenship . most jews around the world can easily claim and get israeli citizenship , while israeli - arab citizenship is withdrawn if they marry a non - israeli . : in the contrary , many jewish communities still live in yemen , iran , morocco , tunisia and other arab countries and it is rare that they are persecuted like the israeli - arabs in israel who are often linked to hamas and islamic jihad by many zionist organizations if not by the racial profiling of the israeli government itself . [ wiki link : yasser arafat ] of even have a chief rabbi in his admin stration for the palestinian territories . : finally , the term \" arab anti - semitism \" for arabs is not an accurate description of the arab feelings towards the jews . arabs appear to alien themselves from the accused practices against jews\n",

      "your point ? views evolve over time , and i admit i was wrong back in . the problem is that as romanians we are constantly told by our politicians and the media that all eastern romance - speaking peoples are romanians . the reality is more complex than that . ' : are you sure you speak vlach language ? : actually , i read over what i wrote in and i do n't necessarily disagree with it now . i still agree that vlach and romanian are the same language , in the same way that moldovan and romanian are the same language from a linguistic perspective . this should definitely be stated in the article : that vlach and romanian are linguistically identical . however , it should also be stated that the vlachs of serbia call their language vlach rather than romanian . simply providing a redirect to [ wiki link : romanian language ] is misleading . ' : you see ) however , people from serbia want to express their romanian ancestry , thus calling them romanians of serbia and not vlachs of serbia . they su c ceded since st of august , just days ago this ! : it 's pov to say that they are n't romanians . namely the serbian gov . pov , luc kly they accepted to change it since . implementation of that agreement was done on st of august ! : it 's the same language , the same people . period . : my argument is that everyone has the right to choose their own ethnic identity ; we can not attribute or assign people to a certain ethnicity . if a hungarian from romania wants to declare himself or herself \" romanian \" , they are free to do so , and they would be counted as \" romanian \" on the census . it is the same issue here . there are , or so people in serbia who choose to declare themselves \" vlachs \" . there also around , people in central serbia who choose to declare themselves romanian . and , there are some eastern - romance ancestry people who choose to declare themselves \" serbian \" . i do n't see what the problem is . how can you call someone romanian when that person does not consider themselves romanian or declare their belonging to the romanian ethnicity ? this does n't mean that the vlachs and romanians are n't the same people from a linguistic and \" scientific \" point of view . the case is similar to [ wiki link : valencian ] . ' : the agreement was signed in nov . . [ external link : ] and the implementation was done only after years ! [ externa link : http : www . roman iu it ati . eu content view ] at st of august , days ago ! : everyone is free to choose their own ethnic identity . the problem was that serbia did n't want to recognize that if they say vlachs that means that they are romanians . this took about years . : but that argument does n't make sense ! if they think of themselves as romanians , why did n't they declare \" romanian \" ? why did they declare \" vlach \" ? remember that some of them did declare romanian . ' : because saying vlach means automatically romanian . that 's why . it 's the same as a moldovan ar de le an ol tean etc . and they are not saying v las ki but rum uni . only the serbs are calling them v las ki . : that argument still does n't make sense . you 're arguing that these people \" feel \" romanian , right ? ( \" sim t rom ne te \" ) . if so , then why did n't they declare that they were romanians ? the fact that they declared \" vlach \" means that they were re tic ent to declare their romanian ethnicity . in the census , you get just one choice of expressing which ethnicity ( not \" regional identity \" ) fits you best . evidently , those , people who declared \" vlach \" thought that this was a better description of their ethnicity than \" romanian \" . ' : oh ye as it makes a lot of sense . just tell me , did they care to be named romanians or not ? did they made all the things possible to make this happen ? if they were not romanians and other ethnicity why would they bother to make it happen ? tell me please . with good arguments . and please , do n't praise the milo se vici regime till because we know it very well , that no compromise from serbs could be done in those days , and serbia was not a democratic country . what could you expect from serbia of that time ? especially not the recognition that vlachs are romanians . and that they speak the same language : romanian language . : just one thing about \" v las ki \" - they actually did declare themselves \" v las ki \" . if they declared \" rum uni \" they would 've been counted as romanians . my understanding of the problem is that there are some vlachs who see themselves as romanian , and maybe that number has increased since the census . but is this new council that has been created the official representative of the vlachs of serbia ? of all of them ? ' : yes , for all of them . have you not read carefully the whole article ? and do n't you understand that the agreement was made after the census ? : i do n't know then . this is a complex case . i think we would need some official evidence . i 'm not saying i do n't trust what romanian global news is saying , but rather its choice of terminology . the council still calls itself \" vlach ( rou man ian ) \" . why does n't it call itself simply \" romanian \" if they were the same identity ? ' : you see . i demonstrated you we 're right . tell me if it 's not the same identity when you say you 're tran sylvanian ar de le an ol tean etc . how can you call someone romanian when that person does not consider themselves romanian or declare their belonging to the romanian ethnicity ? this does n't mean that the vlachs and romanians are n't the same people from a linguistic and \" scientific \" point of view . the case is similar to [ wiki link : valencian ] . : reply : who said that they do n't view themselves as romanians ? they fight for their case in order to be recognized as romanians . they were viewed by the others \" namely ser bians \" as different from romanians . : i agree that the serbs view them as being different from romanians , but they also view themselves as being different . the fact that they declared \" vlach \" shows this . if they viewed themselves primarily as romanians , they would have declared \" romanian \" . it 's a really simple issue . ' : tell me when a ar de le an ol tean moldovan says he 's a ar de le an . etc does not view himself as a romanian . and do n't forget that the agreement was made after the census . only then serbia recognized that vlachs of serbia are romanians . : ) the census asked for \" ethnicity \" not for \" regional identity \" . an \" ar de le an \" might indeed view himself as romanian also , but we have no right to make that decision for him . in fact , i have met people who say they are \" tran sylvanian \" but are not even ethnic romanians ( often , they are mixed romanians and hungarians ) . the point is that we can not think for other people , we can only report what they themselves declare . : ) i do n't that recognising vlachs as romanians is up to the state of serbia , but rather to the individual themselves . the individual has the choice to declare whatever they want in the census . yes , the agreement was made after the census . but that does n't mean that if , people declared themselves \" vlachs \" today they should be assigned to a \" romanian \" ethnicity even though they themselves declared something else than romanian . ' well , it might be history . i want to make it clear that i 'm not coming here with a particular pov and i am open minded . my only fear is that the romanian media , like the serbian media , like all media outlets , is distorted , and thus we ca n't only represent that single point of view . ' : yes , i know that r online . i 'm sure that at the next census in serbia , more romanians will appear . this council has now all the conditions to develop everything that is good for the romanian community to develop itself like all the rest of minorities from let 's say vojvodina in a democratic serbia , which defends all the rights of the minorities and does not try to divide them artificially in different communities . romanians of serbia , if they are recognized will be the largest minority of new serbia\n",

yes , i also should n't be talking to myself ! you would really hope people would have better things to be doing with their time , instead of ob ses sing over you and i and our contributions . i can only imagine this daft creature is a rather lonesome character . amus ingly , he claims to be watching the [ wiki link : sch el dt ] from his window . yet his ip is coming up near kid der minster . i think our daft friend might have gotten himself lost , or confused . either or ! : he claims to be a solicitor and yet he can not differentiate between a threat , which of necessity pertains to a potential future action , and a report , in this case information about a past action which has probably been done already . well , i see i have just received his \" last - ever message \" to me ( and he \" means it \" ) so i must now face the future without his invaluable guidance and mentoring . how will i cope ? as winston churchill said , i will just have to k bo , i suppose . : after another short trip to spi , of course , and this time a request for cu as apparently he has a whole battalion of trolls under his command . you 've seen it all before . : anyway , i 've noticed all the categorisation work you 've done lately as it has touched on many of the th century players and this is good stuff as i think the system needs better and more thorough categorisation as an aid to reader navigation . i 've been trying to tie up loose ends and repair categorisation in the international tour articles ; working on west indies at the moment . : all the best . : yes , he left me a most romantic \" parting \" comment . i though the way he was ob ses sing he would ask me on a date , alas it 's not to be ! i do like this though , his comment to you where he says , \" as you could not resist more offensive remarks we leave with a list of crimes . \" . and he claims you have multiple personalities ! who are \" we \" ? : i finally got through mcc category , which took an age and compiled a list of fc mcc cricketers who do n't have an article . just players outstanding ! i 'll try and set up some categories for the early \" j blogs xi \" teams . i also have a list of english first - class teams , but am at a loss of a quick way to find out total matches played , won and lost and overall win loss . liking your tour work , very thorough ! : i 've always found mcc a daunting prospect and not surprised there are so many , especially in the th century . i believe we do have articles or stubs about all players up to the early s . without those , i think your figure would be well over the thousand . i 'll keep an eye on the list and see if i can help at some stage but i 'll have to finish all the tours first now i 've started . for the first - class win loss stats , you could try the acs via their website as they just might have something like that . they probably would welcome the enquiry and try to assist . all the best . it was quite interesting , found many who we had done as \" j . smith \" who i managed to find their full names and a bit about them , one of them was a norfolk mp and merchant . those who say nothing will ever be discovered about them are talking nonsense . on the subject of our daft friend , it seems his socks are coming out of the drawer . amus ingly he does n't seem to understand an ip will geo locate him to a rough area . he 's not in belgium or wherever it was he said he is ! he 's as successful a troll as cook is a captain ! : exactly . there 's always the possibility of finding more information somewhere and it makes complete sense to have a stub set up so that the information can be added in due course . with players , as long as we can confirm he played in a first - class match that is enough for a stub . we must have a lot of these \" gentlemen \" cricketers who have turned out to be notable in another sphere . i remember one a while back , meth u en or something , and it turned out he already had an article as a politician or whatever . : i think cook has to go now but the problem is who will take over ? probably bell , but has he done any captain cy ? maybe they 'll have to think back to mike bre ar ley and pick someone just as a captain . andrew gale , possibly ? : it 's like [ wiki link : welsh ( mcc cricketer ) ] who is [ wiki link : richard welch ( cricketer ) ] , or [ wiki link : a . bull er ] who is [ wiki link : anthony bull er ( mp ) ] . if we did n't have these stubs this probably would have been neglected to have been discovered . setting the inclusion guideline at one fc appearance is practical and very simple ! personally i think the whole cook moo res downton \" experiment \" is an abject failure and those three , along with giles clarke should resign in shame at the awful team they have produced . i ca n't see an obvious replacement for captain , this seasons best in the championship is an irishman ! pie tersen must return , but wo n't with the clowns in charge of the circus . oddly bell averaged with him in the team and with him out of the team . madness ! : they 'll have to persuade andrew strauss out of retirement at this rate but you 're right that moo res , downton and clarke have failed miserably . ca n't see them lasting till lun ch time tomorrow in this test . strauss is part of the problem , cook was influenced by his useless character less captain cy . it 's a shame di mi tri mas ca ren has was never a test cricketer , he had war ne 's addiction to playing to win , even if it meant losing . : all told , we 're right back to the problems we had in the ei gh ties and nineties when those \" experts \" on sky were playing . we need a mike gat ting ray il ling worth type if there is one out there . : thanks , jen ks have protected the pages . well they made it past lunch . but that was about it . shocking shots ! but captain useless wants to stay on . of course he no doubt believes himself to be above criticism and part of the moo res downton club . as long as the dressing room is happy and there 's no whistling !

      "this page should be renamed , i think . \" indian removal \" is not a proper name . i 'm not sure what the title of the article there was a federal indian removal act of which called for the removal of all eastern indians . this policy was carried out both in the south and the north . the events in the south attracted more attention . however after the tribes were moved west of the mississippi , with some exceptions ( such as the movement of tribes from kansas to the [ wiki link : indian territory ] it is a stretch to say indian removal was the policy as it changed to one of establishing reservations . so the topic name is viable but applies to a limited period . probably we should have done a native american history topic rather than the diffuse set of topics we have come up with . : i understand the sentiment , however i think this article , if properly constructed , should become about the specific period in american - indian relations when the indian removal act was made and enforced , so it can then be put as a link if a more general indian history is generated , to better flesh out the specifics of this p ar tic ul arr period for readers . : - wor kin on it : ( pst ) : ( uct ) december , : i agree with wor kin ' on it . let this become a specific article on the removal act ( before , during , after ) , enriched with text , discussion of the act , debate , etc . bill w . : i think indian removal is a very appropriate or apt name as it is even specified by the u . s . government as the proper definition of a behavior . ok you guys . listen up . jackson needs to get his act together . you guys do too . he went against treaties and supreme court rulings . y preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : with the eyes of a wikipedia reader from another corner of the world the title or lemma \" indian removal \" is a bit of an enigma to me . from what i read it deals with a form of ethnic cleansing by way of forced deportations . the fact that the us - government called it this way is not really a strong reason to take that as a lemma ; i have not yet met anybody alive who would write about \" jewish removal from germany \" although that would be pretty close to what the german government then liked to call \" um si ed lung der juden in den o sten \" or \" ges am tab schi e bung der juden \" . not good to call spade a spade ? : umm , read the discussion further down the page where it better discusses the reason for the title . [ wiki link : talk : indian removal move back to indian removal ] : read it - that is not my point . how the perpetrators back than called is something to be mentioned in the ext but not a good reason to choose a lemma . \" removal \" is an euphemism , a term chosen to make a very ugly thing look nicer . that is why the nazis talked about \" removal of jews to the east \" . turkey until now officially also talks about the \" removal of armenians \" to syria . nobody else calls it that way . this is a universal encyclopedia . why should regional sensitivities ( i imagine it may be a bit sensitive in the us ) lead to use euphemisms instead calling a deportation a deportation and ethnic cleansing just that ? : because we are not here to make up new terms or retroactively assign names to past events based on our modern sensibilities . if a majority of sources or scholars started referring to it as the \" native american genocide and ethnic cleansing policy \" , we would change our titles accordingly , but since it was an actual governmental policy named [ wiki link : indian removal act ] most scholars still use variations of this name to describe the phenomenon . while i agree that native american genocide and ethnic cleansing better describes the actions , this is not how it is referred to in sources . besides , [ wiki link : wikipedia : other stuff exists ] . : ok , i am not deep enough into that debate to judge on the scholarly debate ( inside us ? internationally ? ) . but that is surely no sound base for continued use of euphemisms in the text ? opening sentence \" policy . to relocate native american tribes \" , further down : \" plans to move all indian tribes \" , \" policy of indian removal , which called for relocation of native american tribes \" , and so on . a few times \" forced removal \" . i imagine someone living in a valley to become a water reservoir may be \" forcibly removed \" or evic ted - deportation is a different level , right ? do you really think these euphemisms should stay in place , even if the title is what us - scholars prefer to use ( btw : are there native american historians writing ? what do the use ? ) : find reliable sources to support such uses and then update the article accordingly . as he iron ymous rowe indicated , we are not here to make up revisionist language based on current sensibilities . : ( ec ) to quote the section below that i earlier linked to : you 'll notice a big difference typing in \" indian removal \" into google as opposed to \" native american removal \" it 's about , to , . and nearly all reliable sources refer to the period as \" indian removal \" , including [ external link : pbs ] , [ external link : the united states government ] , [ external link : the seminole tribe of florida ] , [ external link : teach us history . org ] , [ external link : the state of alabama ] , [ external link : the encyclopedia britannica ] , [ external link : the national center for the humanities ] , and most , if not all , educational institutions , such as [ external link : university of houston ] , [ external link : university of arkansas ] , [ external link : tennessee technology institute ] , [ external link : columbia university ] , [ external link : oklahoma state university ] , [ external link : washington university ] , and [ external link : university of wisconsin ] , [ external link : utah education network ] . each of those links connects to a page that refers to the period as the time of \" indian removal \" . : at least one native american tribe is included in that list as well as the encyclopedia brittanica . now , can you find a majority of scholars elsewhere arguing that is is named something else ? we are an ency c lo po edia , not an activist group . we use what the real world professionals use as a title , not what we may personally feel is ethically the right thing to call it . see [ wiki link : wp : soap ] . : sorry if i was not clear enough . if the lemma is the prevalent scholarly use - so be it . protest sh el ved . understood ? but what about the use of euphemisms in the text ? the contents describe deportations ( and you could say : ethnic cleansing as per international definition \" a purposeful policy designed by one ethnic or religious group to remove by violent and terror - inspiring means the civilian population of another ethnic or religious group from certain geographic areas . ( commission of experts established pursuant to united nations security council resolution ) \" ) . so what would be a reason to describe in the text of the lemma \" indian removal \" the deportation and cleansing measures as \" removals , move , relocation \" ? : same as the reason above , that is the way it is described in scholarly texts . if you can find scholarly sources describing the events in the terms you are describing , then such information can be integrated into the article . this has nothing to do with international definitions of what is or is not ethnic cleansing , but what published reliable scholarly sources use to describe these events . we do not get to [ wiki link : wp : synth ] or [ wiki link : wikipedia : no original research ] our personal interpretations into articles . see [ wiki link : wp : npov ] , [ wiki link : wp : reliable ] , and all of the other blue linked wikipedia policy pages i have linked to here and above . neutrality problem the intro is definitely not neutral in its choices of words : { my emphasis in bold & bold - ital ; comments in braces } \" the reasoning behind the removal { needs a cite } of native americans was americans ' hunger for land ( stemming from andrew jackson 's talk of \" agriculture , manufacture , and civilization \" ) , { needs a cite , and this attribution to jackson is wrong ; it 's jefferson . zin n 's a people 's history of the united states ( herein after ap ho tus ) there is this , at pg : when jefferson doubled the size of the nation by purchasing the louisiana territory from france in . he thought the indians could move there . he proposed to congress that indians should be encouraged to settle down on smaller tracts and do farming ; also , they should be encouraged to trade with whites , to incur debts , and then to pay of these debts with tracts of land . ' . two measures are deemed expedient . first to encourage them to abandon hunting . secondly , to multiply trading houses among them . leading them thus to agriculture , to manufactures , and civilization . ' \" } i note as an ironic aside that jefferson 's suggested policy of en tic ing the indians into inde b tedness and then forcing them to sell their land to pay off the debt is exactly the practice the world bank and international monetary fund adopted , particularly under \" the chicago boys \" and the late uncle mil tie friedman ( whom i 'd term a neo - fascist ; ditto wolfowitz , pod ho re tz et ux , the k ri st ols , pere et fils , dick per le , etc . ) , to steal poor nations ' natural resources , lands , industries , kill disappear their unionists , dissidents , those with a social con sci ence and economically en slave them in the name of \" democracy \" and \" free markets . \" im h ann no in my humble and not necessarily neutral opinion . but one gets that way after reading zin n 's ap ho tus ( and naomi klein 's \" shock doctrine \" i can say , from first - hand experience . { continuing article } though not all americans supported the policy as many poor { and apparently some rich ones like wm . holland thomas } white fron tier smen were neighbors and often friends to the native americans . principally , it was the result of americans who envisioned a cultivated and organized nation of prosper ing cities and productive communities { \" prosper ing \" by whose definition ? ditto \" productive communities } which fueled the forces of removal . the growth of populations , cities , transportation systems , and commerce in the decades following the american revolution created demand for agricultural development { probably more than just ag ri c ul tur al yes , in fact : see ap ho tus quotes above & below } . \" president jackson and his followers , recognizing { that } the native americans were in their way { \" in their way \" is really , really loaded ( non - neutral ) } , set out to civilly and gently move them out of the way . [ ] { and \" civilly and gently \" are also loaded words and inaccurate . even worse ( imho ) , attributing the sentence to howard zin n 's ap ho tus as note is really off profoundly inaccurate and a misrepresentation . } here 's zin n 's chap . , as long as grass grows or water runs ( beginning at pg ) . if women , of all the subordinate groups in a society dominated by rich white males , were closest to home ( indeed , in the home ) , the most interior , then the indians were the most foreign , the most exterior . women , because they were so near and so needed , were dealt with more by patron ization than by force . the indian , not needed indeed , an obstacle could be dealt with by sheer force , except that sometimes the language of pat ern alism preceded the burning of villages . . and so , indian removal , as it has been politely called , cleared the land for white oc cup ancy between the app al achi ans and the mississippi , cleared it for cotton in the south and grain in the north , for expansion , immigration , canals , railroads , new cities , and the building of a huge continental empire clear across to the pacific ocean . the cost in human life can not be accurately measured , in suffering not even roughly measured . most of the history books given to children pass quickly over it . statistics tell the story . we find these in michael ro gin 's fathers and children : in there were . million americans , and most of the lived within miles of the atlantic ocean . by , there were million americans , and by , . million had crossed the appalachian mountains into the mississippi valley . in , , indians lived east of the mississippi . by , fewer than , were left . most of them had been forced to migrate westward . but the word \" force \" can not convey what happened . { back to the article : } this resulted in numerous treaties in which lands were purchased from native americans . eventually , the u . s . government began encouraging native american tribes to sell their land by offering them land in the west , outside the boundaries of then - existing u . s . states , where the tribes could re settle . { also not accurate . } well , i 'm at a bit of a loss here . the page should be completely rewritten , imho . further , i 'm flat - out no expert on first american , or indian , affairs at all , but , in writing a little screed on the latest israeli activities vs . gaza , i started looking at [ external link : indian ] tribal names , ha bi tations & languages , and just finished reading charles frazier 's novel thirteen moons , in which the protagonist , will cooper , a white male orphan , has lots of attributes of the real [ wiki link : william holland thomas ] . frazier says \" will cooper is not william holland thomas , though they do share some dna . \" ( p . , author 's note ) . and it certainly covers the north caro lin ian cher o kees in the time before , during and after the removal act , civil war and later . all of which personal experiences suggest that indian wh i tem an interactions need a thorough , truthful treatment in wikipedia . thus this question : is there an effort to ' rationalize ' or ' organize ' the entire treatment of american indian vs . the white man ( and or vice - versa ) in the wiki ? if you take a look at this [ external link : map ] , purporting to show the indian \" states , \" as i 'd call them , around , you 'll notice that the entire continent is \" covered \" ( occupied ) , and that the legend lists of these \" states . \" then there 's a nice list of indian [ external link : languages ] here , that number ( not including alternative language tribe names , which would take the count to , . here is that list . skim it and , i think , you 'll be surprised at how familiar the names are , because of current products , buildings , cities , towns , bodies of water , other things : a ' an an in ( a ane ) ;

its use here is more understandable than the other links , but is still problematic : removal and destruction are not synonymous . after the many deaths from disease on the \" trail of tears , \" for example , cherokee population steadily increased . ( today the population is at least times the pre - removal population . ) andrew jackson believed that removal saved the \" five civilized tribes \" from extinction ; historian robert re min i thinks he was right . some experts might have argued that indian removal was genocidal ; if so , that should be cited in the article , rather than in an ambiguous link . i want to see kevin use this same racist argument to support eliminating the use of the word genocide in reference to the jewish population in ww . clearly another wik ir ac ist . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by : ok , i 'll buy those , but i think it would be harder to argue against a parallel to [ wiki link : ethnic cleansing ] . june , : ( utc ) : it was ethnic cleansing in the view that one ethnic group was completely removed from a territory . : [ wiki link : cultural imperialism ] refers to what happened to the natives that stayed behind . the choice was between being [ wiki link : cultural imperialism culturally absorbed ] or [ wiki link : ethnic cleansing ethnically cleansed ] so i 'm replacing the [ wiki link : cultural imperialism ] . it gives an important view on those that remained and those that remained are heavily mentioned in this article . : i believe the term genocide is applicable , if you define the term as the purposeful destruction of another culture . however , since some do n't see genocide this way , i 'd suggest perhaps making another heading in the article concerning the lasting effects of the indian removal policies as far the de ci mation of indigenous culture is concerned . while i personally feel that the term genocide is applicable , the argument that calling it genocide opens the door to all kinds of questions of bias is also true , so for the sake of historical integrity i would try to avoid using such a charged word in what is supposed to be a recounting of known facts , and leave the debate over whether or not the policy has led to a slow and quite genocide for discussion outside the article itself . apartheid , perhaps . generally it is apartheid on both sides , so i think the term applies . just have a section in which apartheid is used to correctly frame what is meant by the word in this context . and cultural imperialism most certainly applies , as the indian removal policy was accompanied and part nered with huge amounts of missionary work and rhetoric about \" ci vi li zing \" the red savages . : - wor kin on it : ( pst ) : ( utc ) december , andrew jackson removed native - americans from land that he wanted to make available to ( white ) citizens of the united states . the germans nazis removed poles from land that they wanted to make available for germans . i believe the record shows that germans were executed as \" war criminals \" after world war ii for their involvement in \" pole removal \" during the war . perhaps a supporter of jackson 's policy can explain how the american policy of \" indian removal \" differed in intent or execution from the german nazi policy towards poles during world war ii .

o toe , cheyenne , ar ap aho , qu ap aw , ton kawa , comanche , an adar ko , etc . ) and there were attempts to remove tribes from the far west to \" indian territory \" as well ( mo doc are still there ; nez per ce got out of it ) . that 's not even covering any attempts at \" removal \" to areas that are n't indian territory . or the removals of \" smaller \" tribes that are uncovered in this article ( wy and otte , seneca , pe oria , etc . ) . : i believe the reason those are n't included in this article is that for the most part indian removal in its proper - noun form refers to the policies and actions , some unquestionably illegal , of presidents in the late 's and early 's , most notably andrew jackson , who ignored a supreme court ruling stating that the removal policy was illegal on the grounds of \" states rights \" while simultaneously attempting to enforce federal tariffs in other states hand over fist . this particular era in american - indian relations is very well documented and studied , which means there is plenty of source material for an article . i believe that is why they are n't mentioned . i understand why you think they should be included , and do n't disagree ( i 'm od awa , and the article does n't mention us either ) but i also can see why that would not be immediately included in the article . : - wor kin on it : ( pst ) : ( uct ) december , neutrality tag i agree , it was not very neural but in a different manner . to say in the introduction that andrew jackson dealt with the indians civilly and gently is a gross misrepresentation of the facts . this article is highly critical of the u . s . government during the period of indian removal , and how ever justified that may be , articles must be written in a [ wiki link : wp : npov neutral manner ] , not a skewed tone . this is my first time looking at this article in a while , and it appears to have obtained a strong pov since i last saw it . : i 've also removed some of the links in the see also section : [ wiki link : american empire ] - the wider picture . : [ wiki link : manifest destiny ] - explains the united states perspective on why indian removal was necessary . : [ wiki link : cultural imperialism ] - spreading of english and united states culture amongst the tribes . : [ wiki link : ethnic cleansing ] - removal of one ethnic group from land to make room for other groups . : the top three on the above list are really unrelated to this an example of personal unsourced conclusions about a historical event . manifest destiny ( the idea that the us should reach coast to coast ) had nothing to do with indian removal , and the article about the \" american empire \" does n't either . cultural imperialism falls into the same category . a general rule of thumb is that if you have to justify the inclusion of a link with unsourced commentary , it probably does n't belong in a see also section . \" ethnic cleansing \" was removed because it 's linked to in the first sentence already . : manifest destiny , does have something to do with the indian removal . the concept of manifest destiny originated among the jack sonian democrats , and was an integrate part of the political climate that lead to the indian removal act . i am reinserting that : ah no someone else already did that . i think it is nuetral . : i am in agreement with keeping manifest destiny in the \" see also \" section . it has everything to do with indian removal how exactly was the us to \" reach coast to coast \" without dis placing the native peoples who lived there . the idea of manifest destiny implies indian removal . manifest destiny has everything to do with indian removal . this is an extreme example but , you would n't remove \" see also \" links to the halo caust in an article about hitler just because it paints him in a negative light . to think manifest destiny does n't apply to indian removal and the ideas should n't be inter linked because it paints the american government in a negative light is simply naive . preceding [ wiki link : wikipedia : signatures unsigned ] comment added by move back to indian removal the page was moved to \" native american removal \" today and i 've moved it back . i understand the reason for the move , but the term \" indian removal \" is kind of a set - in - stone term that specifically refers to the period in the s when the us government removed native americans . \" native american removal \" is not the correct term for the period . for example , one of the major government acts of the era was called the [ wiki link : indian removal act ] . you 'll notice a big difference typing in \" indian removal \" into google as opposed to \" native american removal \" it 's about , to , . and nearly all reliable sources refer to the period as \" indian removal \" , including [ external link : pbs ] , [ external link : the united states government ] , [ external link : the seminole tribe of florida ] , [ external link : teach us history . org ] , [ external link : the state of alabama ] , [ external link : the encyclopedia britannica ] , [ external link : the national center for the humanities ] , and most , if not all , educational institutions , such as [ external link : university of houston ] , [ external link : university of arkansas ] , [ external link : tennessee technology institute ] , [ external link : columbia university ] , [ external link : oklahoma state university ] , [ external link : washington university ] , and [ external link : university of wisconsin ] , [ external link : utah education network ] . each of those links connects to a page that refers to the period as the time of \" indian removal \" , and not only to the \" indian removal act \" . : in addition , the article states it is about the \" nineteenth century policy of the government \" . in fact , the policy was officially referred to by andrew jackson and the us government ( and historical sources today ) as \" indian removal \" and not \" native american removal . \" letter by andrew jackson the original letter handwritten by [ wiki link : andrew jackson ] and sent by major david haley to [ wiki link : choctaw ] and [ wiki link : chic as aw ] leaders was recently discovered in a private family collection , and re sold to an undisclosed buyer by nathan and jonas ra ab of the ra ab collection . see [ externa link : http : www . ra ab collection . com show section . aspx ? itemid ] for an image of one page of the letter . i am not sure how this should be integrated with the wikipedia articles about the indian removal . pov dated april , the pov template on this article is dated april , . since that time there have been numerous edits of the article , and it has become smaller by about , characters . so , is there any way to resolve the point of view problem of this article ? : i personally do n't see the tag as being warranted anymore . if some still thinks it 's pov , they can readd it w an explanation . i 'm removing it now . map why should there be a map that mostly depicts battles against western indians like the sioux and apache in an article about indian removal ? note that there is nothing depicted in the eastern united states , where removal actually happened , and that the ones shown in oklahoma are all much later than removal . jr ta yl ori v 's claims in his edit summary [ external link : here ] are inaccurate -

      "therefore moses mendelssohn refers to his older arguments which he used in his dispute with lav ater and more recently in response to an anonymous rec en sion of mendelssohn 's introduction to men as sah ben israel 's vindication of the jews . august friedrich cr an z from prussia published it under this title and pretended to be josef von son nen fel s ( \" the admirer s * \" ) a privileged jew who could influence the politics at habsburg court . he adressed mendelssohn directly : das for schen nach li cht und recht in einem sch rei ben an herr n moses mendelssohn auf ver an l as su ng se iner mer kw r di gen vor rede zu man nas eh ben israel ( the searching for light and justice in a letter to mr . moses mendelssohn occasion ed by his remarkable preface to man nas eh ben israel ) , \" vienna \" ( reprint : ; engl . trans l : ) . with the medieval metaphor of masonry for the [ wiki link : art of memory ] ( often represented al leg or ically as \" [ wiki link : prudence ] \" ) and its reference to religious education as a moral and sentimental education , he tried to turn back lav ater 's projection . while christians like to regard the crisis of judaism , mendelssohn regards the present situation in the eve of the [ wiki link : french revolution ] as a general crisis of religion : wenn es wa hr ist , da die eck ste ine me ines ha uses au stre ten , und das ge b u de ein z ust r zen dro het , ist es wo hl ge than , wenn ich me ine hab se lig keit aus dem unter sten sto k wer ke in das ob er ste rette ? bin ich da si che rer ? nun ist das christ en tum , wie sie wi ssen , auf dem juden tu me ge bau et , und mu noth wen dig , wenn dies es f ll t , mit i hm ber einen hau ff en st r zen . if it is true , that the corner stones of my house had become so weak , that the building might tumble down , shall i follow the advice to save my goods from the ground to the upper floor ? will i be safer there ? as you know , christianity is built upon judaism and so , if the latter tu mbles , the former will necessarily fall over it in one heap of rubble . mendelssohn 's house metaphor from the beginning of the first part re appears at the beginning of the second part . here he used it to reflect the historical fact that christianity never developed its own ethics independent from the [ wiki link : ten commandments ] , which are still part of the can onic redaction of the christian bible . lav ater serves here as a more or less moderate example of the hy po c ri tic religious man , whose religion is the favoured and the dominating one within the political system . like in hobbes ' scenario he likes , what the system allows him to do at least in this case : forcing another citizen to convert to the dominating religion . - jews as equal citizens & the crisis of judaism ( the reform of haskalah ) but this hypocrisy reflects once more the radicalism of moses mendelssohn 's contract of tolerance : if the religion 's business has to be reduced to the \" inner side \" and religion itself can not be the formal subject of this contract , it simply means that state affairs like [ wiki link : executive ( government ) executive ] , [ wiki link : legislature ] and [ wiki link : judiciary ] will be no longer religious affairs . nevertheless he was denying the contemporary practice of rabbinic jurisdiction , which was hardly acceptable for a lot of orthodox jews . and one year after the publication of his book the denial of rabbinic jurisdiction became political practice in the [ wiki link : habsburg monarchy ] , when a state edict , added to the \" tolerance patent \" , submitted jewish subjects to its own law court without regarding them on an equal footing with christian subjects . moses mendelssohn is supposed to be the first mas ki lim of his time who denied the present conditions and the rabbinic practice attached to it . this condition was that each jewish community had its own jurisdiction and that the co existence of several communities often corrected judges . his proposition must not only regarded as very modern , it turned out to be substantial during the discussions of the [ wiki link : french legislative assembly ] concerning the [ wiki link : jewish emancipation ] during the s . in these debates judaism was often supposed to be an \" own nation within the nation \" and the jewish representatives had to abandon this former status , so that the jewish population will gain the new status as equal citizens and that they will participate in the new law of the french constitution . in his pr ag matism mendelssohn had to convince the jewish population that they have to abandon the tradition of rabbinic jurisdiction , but in the same time they have no reason to feel inferior , because some christians believe that the moral conditions of jewish tradition has to be regarded as inferior to their theological concept of ab solution . it was up to the christians to find the way back to their fun dam ent , which was the mosaic law . but it was up to the jews to face the present situation , in which jewish communities were abandoned by a wealthy and privileged minority , so that poverty was increasing rapidly especially in the town ghettos . in his philosophy moses mendelssohn reacted to the change from medieval conditions among the communities , when an elite between rich and rabbinic families was ruling the community . new privileges were granted by the prussian state to rich members of the community , so that they finally left the community by conversion . but mendelssohn regarded ben e fic i ence less as a \" co er ce responsibility \" than as a voluntary act of wealthy members . - the ring ( lessing & deism ) moses mendelssohn created a syncretism which combined contemporary humanistic idealism and its [ wiki link : deism de istic ] concept of a natural religion based on rational principles with the living tradition of [ wiki link : ashkenazi jews ash ken asic ] judaism . his adoration of the mosaic law should not be misunderstood as a kind of historical criticism , it was based of an own politically motivated interpretation of the [ wiki link : torah ] as a divine revelation which was offered to the prophet moses , so that he will save judaism from its materialistic decline , sym bo lized in worshipping the golden calf and idol atry , by the divine law . for moses mendelssohn the mosaic law was \" divine \" , as long as the community following its principles would be just . the attribute \" divine \" was just given by the law 's function to create a just social fabric : the [ wiki link : social contract ] in itself . the eternal truth of the law was bound to this function , and it was so less achievable , that any judgement of a rabbi had to be judged according to sal om onic wisdom . mendelssohn referred to an anecdote of the [ wiki link : house of hillel school ] of [ wiki link : mish nah ] which has in itself an own theological formulation of the [ wiki link : categorical imperative ] as kant would later call it on : ein he ide sp r ach : rabbi , le h ret mich das gan ze ge se tz , inde m ich auf einem fu e ste he ! sa mai , an dem er diese zum uth ung vor her er ge hen lie , hat te i hn mit ver ach tung ab ge wi es en ; alle in der dur ch se iner un ber wind liche gel as sen heit und san ft muth ber hm te hillel sp r ach : sohn ! lie be de inen n ch sten wie di ch sel bst . dies es ist der text des ge set zes ; al les bri ge ist kom men tar . nun ge he hin und ler ne ! . a goy said : \" rabbi , teach me the whole law , on which i stand with one foot ! \" sham mai to whom he adressed before with the same im per tin ence , dis regard fully refused him . but hillel who was famous for his in super able serenity and mild ness , replied : \" son ! love thy neighbour as thy self . [ leviticus : ] this is the text of the law , the rest is commentary . now go and learn ! \" with this biblical proverb , often quoted in the new testament including the be ati tudes , mendelssohn returned to the de istic adoration of the mosaic law as the jewish - christian contribution to universal ethics : diese ver f as su ng ist ein zig es mal da ge wes en : nen net sie die mo sa ische ver f as su ng , bey ih rem ein zel nam en . sie ist ver sch w un den , und ist dem all wis sen den alle in be kann t , bey wel chem vol ke und in wel chem jah rh under te sich et was ae hn li ches wi eder wird se hen l assen . the constitution had been here only once : you may call it the mosaic constitution , which was its name . it has disappeared , and only the almighty knows , in which nation and in which century something similar will appear again . \" mosaic constitution \" was just the jewish name of the democratic constitution , as it was called by their ancestors . and probably some jews were waiting for it like for a messiah who would once unban them from feudal slavery . the argument through which he inspired lessing in his drama [ wiki link : nathan der weise ] , was the following : each religion has not to be judged in itself , but only the acts of a citizen who keeps faith with it , according to a just law . this kind of law constitutes a just state , in which the people of different faith may live together in peace . according to his philosophy the new charge of any religion in general was not jurisdiction , but education as a necessary preparation to become a just citizen . mendelssohn 's point of view was that of a teacher who translated a lot of classical rabbinic authors like maimonides from hebrew into german , so that a jewish child would be attracted to learn german and hebrew in the same time . note that mendelssohn 's engagement for german was in resonance with his contemporaries who tried to establish german as an educated language at universities . nevertheless he refused yiddish as a \" corrupt dialect \" : ( [ external link : google books ] ) . - moses mendelssohn 's estimation of the civil conditions at the end of his book mendelssohn returns to the real political conditions in habsburg , french and prussian monarchy , because he was often asked to support jewish communities in their territories . in fact none of these political systems were offering the tolerant conditions , so that every subject should have the same legal status regardless to his or her religious faith . ( in his philosophy mendelssohn discussed the discrimination of the in di vi du um according to its religion , but not according to its gender . ) on the other hand a modern education which mendelssohn regarded still as a religious affair , required a reformation of the religious communities and especially their organization of the education which has to be modernized . as long as the state did not follow john locke 's requirement concerning the \" freedom of conscience \" , any trial of an ethic education would be useless at all and every subject would be forced to live in separation according to their religious faith . reflecting the present conditions mendelssohn adresses directly in the second person to the political authorities : ihr sol l tet g la u ben , uns nicht br der lich wi eder lie ben , e uch mit uns nicht b r ger lich vere ini gen zu k nnen , so lange wir uns dur ch das ze re moni al ge se tz us ser lich unter sche iden , nicht mit e uch essen , nicht von e uch he ur a then , das , so vie l wir ein se hen k nnen , der sti f ter eu rer religion sel bst we der ge than , noch uns er lau bt haben w rde ? wenn dies es , wie wir von christ lich ges inn ten m n ner n nicht ver mu then k nnen , e ure wah re ges inn ung se yn und ble i ben sol lte ; wenn die b r ger liche vere ini gung unter ke iner ander n bed ing ung zu er hal ten , als wenn wir von dem ge set ze ab wei chen , das wir f r uns noch f r ver bin d lich hal ten ; so th ut es uns her z lich le id , was wir zu er kl ren f r n thi g er ach ten : so m ssen wir auf b r ger liche vere ini gung ver zi cht th un ; so mag der men schen f re und do hm ver ge bens ges ch ri eben haben , und al les in dem le id li chen zu stand e ble i ben , in wel chem es itz t ist , in wel chem es e ure men schen lie be zu ver se tzen , f r gut fin det .

[ . ] we can not differ from the law with a clear conscience and what will be your use of citizens without conscience ? in this paragraph it becomes very evident , that moses mendelssohn did not foresee the willingness of some jewish men and women who left some years later their communities , because they do not want to suffer from a lower legal status any longer . the history of reception moses mendelssohn ris ked a lot , when he published this book , not only in front of the prussian authority , but also in front of religious authorities including orthodox rabbis . the following years some of his famous christian friends stroke him in a very sensitive point : his adoration for [ wiki link : lessing ] who died and could not defend his friend as he always had done during his lifetime . mendelssohn & spinoza in the pantheism controversy the strike was done by [ wiki link : friedrich heinrich jacobi ] who published an episode between himself and lessing , in which lessing confessed to be a \" spin oz ist \" , while reading [ wiki link : goethe ] 's [ wiki link : sturm und dr ang ] poem [ wiki link : prometheus ( goethe ) prometheus ] . \" spin oz ism \" became quite fashionable that time and was a rather superficial reception , which was not so much based on a solid knowledge of spinoza 's philosophy than on the \" secret letters \" about spinoza . w . schr der : spinoza im unter gr und . zur re zep tion se ines wer ks in der li tt r ature clandestine [ the underground spinoza - on the reception of his works in french secret letters ] , in : h . del f , j . h . s cho eps , m . walther ( ed . ) : spinoza in der euro p is chen ge ist es geschichte , berlin ; pp . - . these letters circulated since spinoza 's lifetime in the monarchies , where spinoza 's own writings were on the index of the catholic [ wiki link : inquisition ] , and often they regarded spinoza 's philosophy as \" atheistic \" or even as a revelation of the secrets of [ wiki link : kabbalah ] mysticism . klaus ham mac her : ist spin oz ismus k ab bal ismus ? zum ver h lt nis von religion und phi los op hi e im aus ge hen den . und dem begin nen den . jah rh under t [ is spin oz ism k ab balism ? on the relation between religion and philosophy around the turn to the th century ] , in : ar chi vio di fi lo sofia ( ) , pp . - . the german spinoza fashion of the s was more a \" [ wiki link : pantheism controversy pan theistic ] \" reception which gained the attraction of rebellious \" atheism \" , while its followers are returning to a romantic concept of religion . it is astonishing , how superstitious the level of this spinoza reception was in comparison to that of spinoza 's time among scholars and scientists of ley den university : ) m . bo ll acher : der phi los op h und die di chter spi eg el ungen spin oz as in der deutschen roman tik [ the philosopher and the poets - reflex ions of german romanticism in front of spinoza ] , in : h . del f , j . h . s cho eps , m . walther ( ed . ) : spinoza in der euro p is chen ge ist es geschichte , berlin ; pp . - . ) u . j . schneider : spin oz ismus als pan the ismus an mer kun gen zum stre it wer t spin oz as im . jah rh under t [ spin oz ism as pantheism - notes concerning the value of the spinoza reception in th century arguments ] , in : v . cay sa & k . - d . ei ch ler ( ed . ) : pra xis , ver nun ft , gem ein schaft , in honor of hel mut se idel ; we in heim , pp . - . ) about the th century reception at ley den university : marianne aw er buch : spinoza in se iner zeit [ spinoza in his time ] , in : h . del f etc .

[ wiki link : israel jacobson ] , himself a merchant , but also an engaged ped agogue in charge of a land rabbi in west ph alia , was much more successful than david fried l nder . like moses mendelssohn he regarded education as a religious affair . one reason for his success was the political fact , that west ph alia became part of france . jacobson was supported by the new government , when he founded a boy 's school for trade and elementary knowledge in se es en ( a small town near [ wiki link : har z ] ) , called institut f r ar me juden - kinder \" . the language used during the lessons was german . his concept of pedagogy combined the ideas of moses mendelssohn with those of the socially engaged phi lan trop in school which [ wiki link : johann bern hard base dow ] founded in des sau , inspired by [ wiki link : rousseau education and child re aring rousseau ] 's ideas about education . also poor christian boys were allowed to attend the school and it became one of the first schools , which co educated children of different faith . since religious ceremonies were also held in the first reform temple , established on the school 's ground and equipped by an organ . before the jewish community of the town had their celebrations just in a prayer room of the school . since mendelssohn needed the instrument to accompany german and hebrew songs , sung by the pupils or by the community in the jacob stem pel \" . he published his arrangements , german and hebrew hymns adapted to church tunes , in a chant book in which the score of the hebrew songs were printed from the right to the left . israel jacobson : he br ische und deutsche ges nge zur and acht und er bau ung , z un ch st f r die neu en sch u len der israeli tis chen ju gend von west ph al en , cassel . in this year he founded a second school in cassel which was the residence of the west ph alian [ wiki link : jerome bonaparte king jerome ] , napoleon 's brother . he adapted these prayers himself to tunes , taken from famous protestant chor ales . in the charge of a rabbi he read the whole service in german according to the ideas of the reformed protestant rite , and he refused the \" medieval \" free r hy th mic style of cha zz an , as it was common use in the other synagogues . abraham ze bi ide l sohn : jewish music : its historical development , reprint : new york ; pp . - ( chapter xii ) ( [ external link : google books ] ) . israel jacobson introduced a \" confirmation \" ceremony of jewish boys and girls as part of his reformed rite . conflicts in prussia after the vi en nese congress since west ph alia came under prussian rule according to the [ wiki link : congress of vienna ] , the jacobson family settled to berlin , where israel opened a temple in his own house . the orthodox community of berlin asked the prussian authorities to intervene and so his third jacob stem pel \" was closed . prussian officers argued , that the law allows only one house of jewish worship in berlin . in consequence a reformed service was celebrated as [ wiki link : min yan ] in the house of jacob her z beer . the chant was composed by his son who later became a famous opera composer under the name [ wiki link : giacomo me yer beer ] . in opposition to israel 's radical refuse of the traditional synagogue chant , me yer beer re integrated the cha zz an and the re citation of pen tate uch and prophets into the reformed rite , so that it became more popular within the community of berlin . [ wiki link : johann gott fried herder ] 's appreciation of the mosaic ethics was influenced by mendelssohn 's book jerusalem as well as by personal exchange with him . it seems that in the tradition of christian de istic enlightenment the torah was recognized as an important contribution to the jewish - christian civilization , though contemporary judaism was often compared to the decadent situation , when aaron created the golden calf ( described in exodus ) , so enlightenment itself was fas hi oning itself with the ar che typical role of moses . p . l . rose : herder : \" humanity \" and the jewish question , in : ide m : revolutionary antisemitism in germany from kant to wagner , princeton ; pp . - . but the contemporary jewish population was characterized by herder as a strange asiatic and selfish \" nation \" which was always separated from others , not a very original conception which was also popular in the discussions of the national assembly which insisted that jewish citizens have to give up their status as a nation , if they want to join the new status as equal citizens . [ wiki link : hegel heidelberg and berlin : - georg wilhelm friedrich hegel ] whose philosophy was somehow inspired by a \" mosaic \" mission , was not only an important professor at the university in berlin since , he also had a positive influence on reform politics of prussia . though his missionary ambitions and his ideas about a general progress in humanity which can be found in his philosophy , [ wiki link : hegel ] was often disc ri bed by various of his students as a very open minded and warm hearted person who was always ready to discuss cont ro vers ally his ideas and the ideas opposed to it . he was probably the professor in prussia who had the most jewish students , among them very famous ones like [ wiki link : heinrich heine ] and [ wiki link : ludwig b rne ] and also reform ped ago gues like [ wiki link : nach man k ro ch mal ] from galicia . when hegel was still in heidelberg , he was accusing his colleague [ wiki link : jakob fries ] , himself a student of [ wiki link : fi chte ] , for his superstitious ideas concerning german nation and he disregarded his antisemitic activities as a mentor of the [ wiki link : ur bur schen schaft bur schen schaft ] which organized the [ wiki link : war t burg fest ] , the murder of [ wiki link : august von kot ze bu e assassination august von kot ze bu e ] and the [ wiki link : hep riots ] . in he went with his students to the hep riot in heidelberg and they were standing with raised arms before the people who lived in the poverty of the jewish ghetto , when the violent mob was arriving . p . l . rose : revolutionary antisemitism in germany from kant to wagner , princeton ; p . . as result he asked his student [ wiki link : car ov friedrich wilhelm car ov ] to found the first student association which also allows access for jewish students , and finally [ wiki link : eduard gans ] founded in november the vere in f r kultur und wis sen schaft der juden [ society for culture and science of the jews ] on the perspective that the ideas of enlightenment must be replaced by a synthesis of european jewish and christian traditions . this perspective followed some fundamental ideas which hegel developed in his dial ec tic philosophy of history , and it was connected with hopes that finally an enlightened state will se c ul arize religious traditions and full fill their re sp on s ability . in some respect this synthesis was expected as a kind of revolution , though an identification with the demagogues was not possible as heinrich heine said in a letter : ob schon ich aber in england ein ra di kal er und in ital i en ein carbon ari bin , so ge h re ich doch nicht zu den de mag ogen in deutschland ; aus dem gan z zu f lli gen und g [ e ] ring f gi gen gr un de , da bey einem siege dieser let z tern e ini ge ta us end j dis che h lse , und just die be sten , ab ges ch ni tten werden . heine in a letter to mori tz em b den , dated the february -

like eduard gans - converted to the lutheran church . moses mendelssohn 's jerusalem and the rise of revolutionary antisemitism [ wiki link : karl marx ] was not a student of [ wiki link : hegel ] , but hegel 's philosophy whose lectures were also frequented by prussian officers , was still very present after his death as well among conservatives as among radicals who were very disappointed about the present conditions and the failed reform of the state . , when karl inscribed as a student , hegel 's book leben jes u was published posthumously and its reception was divided into the so called right or old and the left or [ wiki link : young he ge lians ] around [ wiki link : bruno bauer ] and [ wiki link : ludwig feu erbach ] . karl has grown up in a family which were related to the traditional rabbinic family levi through his mother . because the rhine province became part of the french republic , where the full civil rights were granted by the constitution , marx ' father could work as a lawyer ( jus ti z rat ) without being discriminated for his faith . this changed , when the rhine province became part of prussia after the congress of vienna . heinrich marx felt forced to convert to the lutheran church , so that he could save the existence of his family continuing his profession . his son was baptized , when he was six years old . the occasion that the jewish question was debated again , was the th land tag of the rhine province . the dicussion was about a law which tried to cancel the har denberg edict from . it was refused by the sta at sr at , it was published again to see what will be the public reactions . the debate was opened between ludwig philipp son ( all gem eine zeitung des juden tums ) and carl hermes ( k l nis che zeitung ) . karl marx was thinking to join the debate with an own answer of the jewish question , but he left it to [ wiki link : bruno bauer ] . his later answer was mainly a reception of bruno bauer 's argument . marx ' and bauer 's polemic style was probably influenced by [ wiki link : heinrich heine ] 's damascus letters ( lute tia te il , ) in which heine was calling [ wiki link : james mayer de rothschild ] a \" revolutionary \" and in which he used phrases like : for french jews as well for all the other french gold is the god of the day and industry the dominating religion ! original text and autograph ( please click on \" e \" ) at [ external link : heinrich heine portal of university tri er ] . heinrich heine sent letters and books to his wife betty de rothschild since , and he asked the family for financial support during the s . whereas hegel 's idea of a humanistic se c ul arization of religious values was deeply rooted in the idealistic emancipation debates around mendelssohn in which a liberal and tolerant state has to be created on the fun dam ent of a modern ( religious ) education , the only force of modernization according to marx was capitalism , the erosion of traditional values , after they had turned into material values . the difference between the ancien r gime and rothschild , chosen as a re pre sen tant of a success full minority of the jewish population , was that they had nothing to lose , especially not in prussia where this minority finally converted to christianity . but since the late th century the prussian jews were merely reduced to their material value , at least from the administrative perspective of the prussian monarchy . marx ' answer to mendelssohn 's question : \" what will be your use of citizens without conscience ? \" was simply that : the use was now defined as a material value which could be expressed as a sum of money , and the prussian state finally did not care about anything else . der mono the ismus des juden ist da her in der wir k lich keit der poly the ismus der vie len bed rf nis se , ein poly the ismus , der auch den ab tri tt zu einem ge gen stand des g tt li chen ge set zes macht . das pra k tische bed rf ni , der ego ismus ist das prin zip der b r ger li chen gesellschaft und tri tt rein als sol ches her vor , so bald die b r ger liche gesellschaft den poli tis chen staat vol lst n dig aus sich her aus ge bo ren . der gott des pra k tis chen bed rf nis ses und ei gen nut zes ist das ge ld . das ge ld ist der ei fri ge gott is ra els , vor wel chem kein and rer gott be stehen dar f . das ge ld er ni ed ri gt alle g tter des men schen , -

[ wiki link : marx and antisemitism karl marx ] used these bizzare words in a less satirical than in an anti humanistic way in the context of the argument between old and young he ge lian , where the old he ge lian , the prussian form of the ancien r gime , figured as the humanists . in any case the jewish privileged minority was more a modern citizen than anyone of the prussian ancien r gime who felt threatened by the industrial revolution , so it was not the par ven u ( as [ wiki link : bernard laz are ] called the rich minority ) who needed to be \" ame li or ated \" . moses mendelssohn who was not mentioned in marx ' answer to the jewish question , might be regarded as far from marx ' position . but mendelssohn had already discussed the problem of injustice caused by material needs in his way : he adv iced to re com pen se politicians according to the loss of their regular income . it should not be lower for a rich man , and not higher for a poor . because if anyone will have a material advantage , just by being a member of par lament , the result can not be a fair state governing a just society . only an idealistic citizen who was engaging in politics according to his modern religious education , was regarded by mendelssohn as a politician . mendelssohn 's philosophy during the age of zionism karl marx ' point of view that the idealistic hopes for religious tolerance will not be reached by political progress itself , but by an economical evolution and a se c ul arization of its values , was finally confirmed by the failure of the [ wiki link : revolution ] . though the fact that revolutionary antisemitism was used frequently by left and right wing campaign ers , for him it was more than r he th oric , his own cynical and refusing attitude concerning religion was widespread among his contemporaries and it was related with the own biography and a personal experience full of dis ap po in tments and conflicts within the family . equal participation in political decisions was not granted by a national law as they hoped , the participation was merely dependent on privileges which were defined by material values and these transformations cause a lot of fears and the ten dence to turn backwards . even in france where the constitution granted the equal status as citizens since years , the [ wiki link : drey fus affair ] made evident that a lot of institutions of the french republic like the military forces were already ruled by the circles of the ancien r gime . so the major population was still excluded and could not identify with the state and its authorities . the response was social movements and emigration to america and palestine , often in a combination . the u top ies of these movements were sometimes secular , sometimes religious , and they often had charismatic leaders . there was the [ wiki link : first zionist congress ] in basel ( switzerland ) , which was an initiative by [ wiki link : the od or her zl ] . the zionist [ wiki link : martin bu ber ] with his rather odd combination of german romanticism ( [ wiki link : fi chte ] ) and his interest in [ wiki link : h asi dism ] as a social movement was not very popular on the congress , but he finally found a very en th usi atic reception in a zionist student association in prague , which was also frequented by [ wiki link : max bro d ] and [ wiki link : franz kafka ] . giuliano bai oni : kafka liter atur und juden tum , stuttgart , weimar . in a time when the jewish question has become a hi gly ideological matter mainly treated in a po pu listic way from outside , it became a rather satirical subject for jewish writers of yiddish , german , polish and russian language . [ wiki link : franz kafka ] learned yiddish and hebrew as an adult and he had a great interest for [ wiki link : h asi dism ] as well as for rabbinic literature . he had a passion for yiddish drama which became very popular in central europe that time and which brought [ wiki link : yiddish ] literature , usually written as narrative pro sa , on stage mixed up with a lot of music ( parodies of

also realized that this romanticism inspired by fi chte and german nationalism , expressed the fact that the rural traditions were another world quite far from its urban admi rers . this had changed since mas ki lim and school reformers like israel jak ob son have settled to the big towns and still disregarded yiddish as a \" corrupt \" and uneducated language . in the parable of his romance [ wiki link : the trial der process ] , published separately as short story entitled [ wiki link : before the law vor dem ge se tz ] , the au ther made a parody of a [ wiki link : mi dr ash ] legend , written during the period of early [ wiki link : mer k ab ah ] my stic sm ( th century ) , that he possibly learned by his hebrew teacher . this pe sik hta described moses ' meditation in which he had to fight against angelic guardians on his way to the divine throne in order to bring justice ( the [ wiki link : torah ] ) to the people of israel . somehow it also reflected mendelssohn 's essay in the context of the public debate on jewish emancipation during the s and s , which was mainly led by christian priests and clerics , because this parable in the romance was part of a christian prayer . a mysterious priest prayed only for the main protagonist \" josef k . \" in the dark empty cathedral . the bizarre episode in the romance reflected the historical fact that jewish emancipation had taken place within christian states , where the separation between state power and the church was never fully realized . there were several similar parodies by jewish authors of the th century in which the christians dominating the state and the citizens of other faith correspond to the jealous guardians . unlike the prophet moses who killed the angel guarding the first gate , the peasant ( ein mann vom land e \" ) in the parable is waiting to his death , when he finally will be carried through the gate which was only made for him . in the narration of the romance which was never published during his life time , the main protagonist josef k . will finally be killed according to a judgement which was never communicated directly to him . hannah arendt 's reception of the haskalah and of the emancipation history [ wiki link : hannah arendt ] 's political theory is deeply based on theological and exist enti alist arguments and her very sceptical reception of jewish emancipation in prussia or of the failure of it is following the standards of moses mendelssohn 's jerusalem \" , although she rarely made it explicit by quoting directly from mendelssohn 's treatise . with exception of an early essay concerning lessing , herder and mendelssohn : auf kl rung und juden frage , in : geschichte der juden in deutschland th edition , vol . , berlin . in this essay hannah arendt regarded moses mendelssohn because of his ideas concerning education and his negative attitude against [ wiki link : yiddish ] as too naive and too idealistic , so that he were not able to understand the real social problems among the inhabitants of a contemporary [ wiki link : ghetto ] . although she finally accepted his standards , she tried to understand , why the following generation of mas ki lim were so convinced of the inferiority of jewish tradition in comparison with the philosophy of enlightenment . although her point of view was often misunderstood as an abuse of a pre judge against judaism , just because of the fact that she often described also forms of op port un ism among jewish citizens , her main concern was totalitarianism , the anachronistic mentality of the ancien r gime , and a postwar criticism which was concerned about the limits of modern democracy . her method was very unorthodox , for instance according sociological standards , because she used [ wiki link : marcel pr ou st ] 's romance [ wiki link : in search of lost time la re cher che du temps per du ] as a historical document and partly developed her arguments on pr ou st 's observations of fau bourg de saint germain , but the publication of this book made her very popular , because she also included an early analysis of stalinism . h . arendt : the origins of totalitarianism , new york . seven years later she finally published her biographical study about [ wiki link : ra hel var n hagen ] , her former studies of var n hagen 's remains at berlin state library were inter up ted by world war ii , when she emigrated to france . in her late book she draws the conclusion that the emancipation failed exactly with var n hagen 's generation , when the high standards of moses mendelssohn 's philosophy were abandoned . according to her a wealthy minority which she called par venues , tried to join the privileges of prussian society . h . arendt : ra hel var n hagen . the life of a jew ess , translated from the german by richard and clara winston ; london . the term \" par ven u \" was taken from [ wiki link : bernard laz are ] and she regarded it as an alternative to [ wiki link : max weber ] 's term \" par ia \" , while she analyzed the exclusion of the jewish population in prussia despite or through their assimilation . in her perception of herder 's concept of judaism as nation , she found max weber 's idea of \" par ia \" somehow anticipated . according to her main work the modern society still remained deeply rooted in the ancien r gime , even after it had multi p lic ated itself into a mass society . notes editions * . english translation * . bibliography * . external links * [ external link : moses mendel sso h ns ' books

      "although i found some documents containing good information , there are still many questions left . generally , most figures need to be updated . the most important gaps of information are summarized in the following questions : * are there any data on water quality and continuity outside of metro manila ? * the clean water act calls for increased wa ste water treatment and sanitation . have there been any major steps to implement this strategy ? for example , how many water treatment plants exist or are planned ? * how does the economic regulation perform ? did it prove to independent from political interference ? have there been any further attempts to create a single regulatory agency for all service providers ? * how did tariffs develop in the last years ? did cost recovery improve , maybe even in l gus ? have there been am al ga mations of l gus or water districts to improve economic efficiency ? * the data i found on general investment in the sector are very poor . is there more precise information on that issue ? how did investment develop after ? what share of investments is financed by the central government ? * what is the share of me tering in l gus , water districts and mw ss ? * is there any more information on private sector participation outside of metro manila ? * more information on external cooperation by development agencies , development banks or ngos is also welcome ! if you have answers or sources of information or you think that there are more issues to be improved , please feel free to work on the article on your own , post your suggestions on this discussion page or on my user page . thank you for your interest and help\n",
