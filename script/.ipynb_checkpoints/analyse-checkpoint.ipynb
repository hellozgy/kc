Perinçek said \"\"\"\"Armenian genocide is an international lie\"\"\"\". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view thatthe mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said \"\"\"\"Armenian genocide is an international lie\"\"\"\").I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3  References\"\"\"\n",

Mel Etitis (Talk)  I haven't taken a stance on the role dispute (Shelby says that she performed the role and is uncredited, and IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors I believe). My comment was geared more toward User:Shelbyyoung's user page with the picture of her holding a notepad with her user name to prove her identity. This IP address shouldn't be removing that. Leebo T/C  IMDb lists uncredited actors if they are given the information and some sort of verification; so if the real Young did appear in the film, it would be easy for her to get that credit added to her IMDb listing (heck, even my kid is in the IMDb, and her scene only appears as an \"\"\"\"alternate ending\"\"\"\"). That's got little to do with the impersonation question.Orange Mike  1. Leebo is correct, IMDB doesn't list uncredited actors (only on special occasions, in fact. See the case of Owen Wilson in \"\"\"\"Night at the Museum\"\"\"\". No onscreen credit, therefore no IMDB credit. It was only after users complained that Wilson had received credit in commercials, his credit was added. 2. Regarding the film page, the page only lists the main actors involved in the film. It's not going to list a voice-over actress.3. Shelbyyoung.com has not been updated since 2004-2005, so no credit after that would appear on the site, and is therefore, an invalid source.4. Many people have edited articles on themselves here. To suggest that Shelbyyoung is not Shelby Young solely on the basis of the fact that she is editing her own article is faulty logic. I don't know how many people remember the case of the user juliannarosemauriello, who claimed to be the real thing, then went on to edit articles clearly not geared toward a (then) 14-year-old. To my mind, the fact that Shelbyyoung has only edited with regard to herself, and the photo, which 69.132.199.100 claims is photoshopped (and what a lovely trick that would be), proves Shelbyyoung's identity. 69.132.199.100 claims that the photo is a \"\"\"\"popular\"\"\"\" one that has been photoshopped.

While I have made mistakes in the past, I assure you I am committed to only contributing to wikipedia.        I am angry because the last time I was blocked was completely unfair. I was issued a warning because I posted \"\"\"\"I love you\"\"\"\" on two users talk pages.

While I tried explaining that I should not be warned for something like this, they decided they did not want to hear the radical idea that they were exerting their overzealous attitude towards me, instead of being responsible admins. As a result, they decided to keep me quiet by blocking me for a week. While on this ban, they decided to accuse me of having a sockpuppet, because this user claimed he was me in an edit. Everybody knows a sockpuppet would not admit he is one in his own edit. Since they foolishly thought this user was a sockpuppet of mine, they extended the block to 1 month, to further keep me quiet. I, obviously finding this as unfair, decided to request an unblock, because an accusation that has no actual evidence is no reason to extend the block. Since this was a way of me speaking out, they rejected and even protected my page, which is why you may not be able to respond on my page until the user decides to unprotect it.        I hope you can get back to me, and really help me out. I feel mistreated, and, as a person that cannot stand unjust people and a person that fights for what is right, I want to fight this, so that this whole mishap is solved. If you can help in any way, that would be appreciated. I know that I might even get blocked again for writing this letter, since it involves me speaking out against the almighty admins, even though what I am speaking out against, is wrong.

No one refers to the baroque lute as \"\"\"\"the 24-string lute\"\"\"\", but correctly as the 13-course lute. This is a well-established musicological/organological convention. \"\"\"\"12-string guitar\"\"\"\" is the only exception to this, and that is only because the term has been disseminated by the popular \"\"\"\"cult(ure)\"\"\"\" in the usual brainwashed ignorance of the masses. If two strings function as one string, they are a COURSE, not two separate strings. In contrast, a ten-stringed guitar has ten separate strings each of which can be separately fretted. This is not the case on the baroque guitar, which effectively only has five courses. Moreover, the term \"\"\"\"ten-string\"\"\"\" guitar has come to signify a particular instrument, which is NOT a baroque guitar. You are evidently not a musicologist/organologist/semiologist/semantician so I don't see what you think you will achieve by being bothersome about this issue, which relates to organology and semantics.\"\"\"\n",

How ironic is that. Rather than have a long detailed discussion here about which opening is better, I'll simply point out that in the current version, even after you read the entire first paragraph, you still don't have a clue why this article exists. You do find out what Marco Rodríguez does for a living though. So yay for that. I guess once you get to the end, you do get some idea why this has been such a big deal, but that's assuming you haven't fallen asleep, or shot yourself, having read the same four words - Brazil, Germany, biggest & loss (and their million variants), multiple times. Seriously, if people here think what's currently serving as an opening to this article summarises the key points in an engaging and professional way, perhaps you need to get a job where your actually paid to write for a living. It's not quite garbage, but it's not good. And please stop justifying such poor/dull/repetitive/trivial writing with the claim the alternatives are \"\"\"\"unencyclopedic\"\"\"\", frankly you couldn't be more wrong. There's no serious disagreement out in the world that this defeat was a shock result and a national humiliation - that will be upfront in the key summary of every decent source writing about this match, both now and in 20 years time.

It's not perfect, but it's a hell of a lot better than the crap people fought tooth and nail to replace it with.Brazil 1–7 Germany was the shock result of the first semi-final of the 2014 FIFA World Cup men's international football tournament, played on 8 July at the Estádio Mineirão in Belo Horizonte, Brazil. It broke Brazil's 62-match home unbeaten streak in competitive matches going back to 1975, and equalled their biggest margin of defeat, tied with a 6–0 loss to Uruguay in 1920, leading it to be described as a national humiliation. The game also saw Germany score the most goals in World Cup history, their 223 overtaking Brazil's 221. Their second goal meant Germany's Miroslav Klose reached 16 World Cup goals, overtaking Brazil's Ronaldo as the tournament's all-time record goalscorer. The game was subsequently referred to by the press as the Mineirazo, evoking the spirit of the Maracanazo in which Brazil unexpectedly lost the 1950 FIFA World Cup on home soil to Uruguay.  \"\"\"\n",

While any edit warring may lead to sanctions, there is a bright-line rule called the three-revert rule (3RR), the violation of which often leads to a BLOCK.The three-revert rule states:An editor must not perform more than three reverts on a single page—whether involving the same or different material—within a 24-hour period. An edit or a series of consecutive edits that undoes other editors' actions—whether in whole or in part—counts as a revert. Violations of the rule normally attract BLOCKS of at least 24 hours.

A \"\"\"\"revert\"\"\"\" means any edit (or administrative action) that reverses the actions of other editors, in whole or in part, whether involving the same or different material.

Editors violating 3RR will usually be BLOCKED for 24 hours for a first incident. Even without a 3RR violation, an administrator may still act if they believe a user's behavior constitutes edit warring, and any user may report edit warring with or without 3RR being breached. The rule is not an entitlement to revert a page a specific number of times.If an editor violates 3RR by mistake, they should reverse their own most recent reversion.
